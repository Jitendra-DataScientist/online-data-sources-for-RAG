      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m The global food sector faces extraordinary risks from the twin challenges of water scarcity and water pollution. Growing competition for water, combined with weak regulations, failing infrastructure, pollution and climate change impacts threaten the sector's water security and contribute to a water availability emergency that was recently ranked the world's \"top global risk\" by the World Economic Forum.This report examines how water risks affect the profitability and competitive positioning of 37 major food sector companies in four industries: packaged food, beverage, meat and agricultural products. It evaluates and ranks these companies -- the majority of which are U.S. domiciled and publicly-traded -- on how well they are positioned to anticipate and mitigate these risks, as well as contribute to improved water resource management.The report provides recommendations for how analysts and investors can effectively evaluate food sector companies on their water risk exposure and management practices. It also provides recommendations for how food companies can improve water efficiency and water quality across their operations and supply chains to reduce risks and protect water resources\n",

Primary and secondary identification methods were used to implement the HAS Manual in this analysis. The HAS Manual which was designed for the specific conditions of Dakara Coffee comprised 11 criteria. The results showed that several identified food and beverage ingredients did not meet the HAS 23000 criteria and lacked supporting documents. Furthermore, several improvements were recommended such as replacing materials that did not comply with HAS 23000 and completing documentation for food and beverage ingredients. By using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, the primary priority for the business development of Dakara Coffee was identified as location, followed by other aspects including halal management, branding strategy, product innovation, and organizational management\n",

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m Culinary businesses, especially in the MSME sector, face increasing pressure to provide high-quality products that satisfy customers. This study aims to investigate effective strategies in improving product quality in the context of the culinary business. The research method used is a case study with a focus on several MSMEs in the culinary sector that have successfully implemented these strategies. The results of the study indicate that there are several key strategies implemented by MSMEs in improving the quality of their products, including:1. Process Simplification, 2. Detailed Written and Video SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) &amp; SOC (Station Observation Checklists), 3. Routine Training and LMS (Learning Management System), 4. Audit and Mystery Shopper, 5. Routine Consumer Survey, 6. Monitor Review Sites and Social Media, 7. Control Receiving &amp; Storage of Raw Materials, 8. Quality Standards of Raw Materials &amp; Vendors, 9. Supporting Equipment and Supplies, 10. Rules and Culture at Outlets, 11. Reward &amp; Punishment, 12. Outlet Organizational Structure.In addition, the findings also identify challenges faced by MSMEs in implementing these strategies, including high costs for high-quality raw materials, difficulty in finding trained workers, and the need to keep up with changing market trends. The implication of this study is the importance of a holistic approach in managing a culinary business, including the integration of comprehensive quality and service strategies to retain and attract customers. This study contributes to the literature on MSME management by offering practical guidance for culinary business owners to improve their competitiveness through a strong focus on product quality and service\n",

      "Therefore, the goal of this research is to present the development and implementation of mystery shopping tool carried out by a Portuguese hotel chain with the final purpose of analyzing its efficiency. This paper shows the methodology towards the construction of the questionnaires that analyze the compliance with the standards, and also describes the technical training throughout the project to which the employees of the Food and Beverage (F&B) department were submitted as well as a comprehensive mystery shopper training program to ensure consistency of quality in the assessment process. After collecting the information of the mystery shopper audits, the information is processed and presented as reports containing the interpretation of the results. The results indicate that an ongoing process of mystery shopping visits can contribute for a short-term improvement in quality service results.\r\n",

Halal certification is a halal certification issued by the Institute for the Assessment of Food, Drugs and Cosmetics (LPPOM-MUI) which states that a product is in accordance with Islamic law. This halal certificate can be used to make halal labels. Government Regulation Number 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Field is an implementing regulation that was born as a follow-up to Law Number 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation. It should be noted that Article 48 of Law Number 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation is the result of an amendment to the previous law, namely Law Number 33 of 2014 concerning Halal Product Guarantee.

The chapter methodically reviews typical food processing stages, from \\nrecipe development through to end product supply, and considers how sensory \\nassessment methods can be utilised to help assure the quality of the end products \\nwithin these selected high-risk chilled food sectors.\\nKey words: sensory analysis, organoleptic assessment, key sensory points (KSPs), \\nquality assurance, quality control, taste panel, ready meals, soups, sauces.\\n11.1 Introduction\\nMulti-component foods such as ready meals, soups and sauces by their very \\nnature comprise a diverse range of ingredients. The final quality of the foods \\nproduced will typically be heavily influenced by the quality of these raw \\nmaterials and the consistency of the production processes involved. With \\nparticular regard to these factors, sensory assessment has a key role to play \\nin ensuring product quality at each stage of the food manufacturing opera-\\ntion. This chapter considers the many development and processing stages \\nof a typical rea y meal, soup or sauce manufacturing operation and pro-\\nvides detail upon the use of sensory assessment within each phase of the \\nproduction process.\\nIt should be noted that during the manufacture of food products there \\nare usually many checks that have to be conducted to help ensure product \\nsafety, quality and legality. This chapter particularly seeks to focus upon the \\nuse of sensory evaluation within the quality assurance (QA) aspects of food \\nproduction. A reputable food manufacturing business QA system will view \\nKIL11.indd   203 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n204 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nsensory evaluation as one of many useful tools to be utilised in the monitor-\\ning and control of product quality, safety and legality throughout the manu-\\nfacturing operation. The reader is therefore encouraged to consider how \\nsuch checks may complement the QA system of their own manufacturing \\noperation.\\n11.2 Sensory quality assurance (QA) in the recipe \\ndevelopment process\\nRecipe creation and development within a multi-component food produc-\\ntion business are typically the role of a new product development (NPD) \\ndepartment. This department is often considered to be the lifeblood of a \\nbusiness as the extent of customer acceptance of its new product creations \\nwill be reflected in the total sales of the business. A very high proportion \\nof the customer\\u2019s engagement with food products is based upon organolep-\\ntic factors (e.g. appearance, aroma, taste and texture) and therefore it is \\nvital that the NPD department utilises a wide range of sensory skills and \\ntechniques in order to create products which will satisfy the expectations \\nof the end consumer.\\nIt is generally accepted that consumers will have subjective reactions to \\nfood products and describe new foods in terms of their \\u2018likes\\u2019 and \\u2018dislikes\\u2019, \\nwhereas food manufacturing operations will often benefit from objectivity \\nin identifying and defining sensory attributes. By combining consumer reac-\\ntions with well-defined sensory attributes it is possible to gain an insight \\ninto those foods which have attributes that consumers will accept and those \\nwhich the consumer will reject.\\nSuch skills at the NPD stage include the ability to be able to physically \\ncreate the product envisaged and this skill is greatly helped by experience. \\nOnce the required product sensory characteristics (including appearance, \\naroma, taste and texture) have been clearly defined, the development chef \\ncan then reflect upon how other products with similar characteristics are \\nmade. Such an approach will often help to then define the ingredient list \\nand the likely production process for the new product.\\nThese skills will certainly help during the following typical NPD \\nscenarios:\\n\\u2022 Blue-sky creativity: sometimes during the development process the \\nNPD team will dream-up ideas for new products, utilising their sensory \\nskills to then create the product which has been envisaged. This is a skill \\nthat can take years to refine, and the process is greatly supported by an \\nability to define and then achieve the desired product sensory \\nattributes.\\n\\u2022 Customer brief: often the business NPD team will receive a \\u2018brief\\u2019/\\ndescription from the customer upon the type of product or product \\nKIL11.indd   204 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 205\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nrange they are interested in procuring. Sometimes these briefs can be \\nextremely detailed, providing the desired key sensory points (KSPs) for \\neach individual recipe, and other times the \\u2018customer brief\\u2019 may only \\noutline a general range of products required and just state the product \\nnames or target consumer groups, in which case the NPD team has a \\nwide degree of artistic licence to formulate product samples designed to \\ngain the customer\\u2019s business.\\n\\u2022 \\u2018Me too\\u2019/\\u2018copycat\\u2019 approach: sometimes the customer or internal busi-\\nness drive will wish to move into a product category/market that already \\nhas the product types in it that they also wish to sell. In such cases busi-\\nnesses will often take product samples of the competition, carry out \\nwell-structured benchmarking sessions, decide upon suitable production \\nmethods for each product, and ideally find a way to make the products \\nbetter than the competition and at a lower cost. Usually in such circum-\\nstances the NPD team will have the added benefit of being able to \\nreview the food packaging label of the product that they are seeking to \\ncopy, and therefore may benefit from knowled e of aspects such as the \\ningredient declarations and nutritional data of the competitors \\nproducts.\\nDuring the NPD process there are a number of techniques that can be \\nutilised to aid the selection of the best products/recipes. These techniques \\ninclude the following:\\n\\u2022 Difference testing: selected business sensory evaluation panel members \\nare each in isolation (to avoid any influence) presented with a set of \\nindividually labelled product samples (typically three), all at the same \\ntime. One sample is different from the other two (i.e. the single sample \\nmay be a proposed new recipe version or the current standard recipe), \\nand the panellists are asked to pick out which sample is different. The \\nresults of the panel will inform the business whether there is an actual \\nconsistently distinguishable difference between the current recipe and \\nthe proposed new recipe.\\n\\u2022 Preference testing or \\u2018consumer testing\\u2019 has limited use in the early \\nstages of the NPD function, but is vital once a product has been devel-\\noped to guage consumer reaction to the new product. Members of the \\nbusiness sensory assessment panel are individually presented with \\nsamples of the current and the proposed new recipe (which are \\nunmarked to ensure that it is unclear which is which) and are asked \\nto select the sample which they prefer. It should be noted that when \\nselecting such a testing method the manager should ensure that it is \\nappropriate for the recipe being assessed. For example, the product \\nbeing assessed may be for eventual sale as an accompaniment to a \\nproduct (e.g. a pour-over sauce for steak), and in such circumstances \\nthe benefits of assessing the product in the context of its end use should \\nbe considered.\\nKIL11.indd   205 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n206 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nWhilst evaluating a proposed new recipe it is important to understand \\nyour customer and the aspects of the product that particularly matter to \\nthem (i.e. the KSPs of the product). Such an approach will help keep the \\nNPD team focused upon delivering specifically what the customer wants.\\n\\u2022 Customer panels can be used to help define the product KSPs (e.g. \\nappearance, aroma, taste, texture) and thereby ensure a business that \\nthe products being developed are likely to meet with the approval of \\nthe end consumer once launched. Customer panels can utilise sensory \\nevaluation techniques including acceptance/preference testing, focus \\ngroups, central location testing and product placement or can simply \\nrequest the panellist to taste the product and state what they like and \\nwhat they dislike about the product, and ultimately would they purchase \\nthe product at the price that it is intended to be sold for?\\nSometimes it will be of benefit to ensure that the consumer panellists \\nselected have experience of regularly eating the product types to be \\ntested in order to ensure that their assessment is very finely focused \\nupon the product KSPs. As a minimum requirement consumers should \\nbe non-rejectors of the product, and ideally they should be current users \\nof the product.\\n\\u2022 \\u2018Old product development\\u2019 (OPD) is a process in which the develop-\\nment team is tasked with making particular improvements/adjustments \\nto existing \\u2018live\\u2019 product recipes. These \\u2018improvements\\u2019 may often be \\nrelated to aspects of product quality or cost (e.g. seeking a sales margin \\nincrease) and such work is an important phase of the product life cycle \\nin terms of protecting product sales/operating margins. OPD also is \\noften required as businesses seek to review their product ranges to meet \\nthe increasing customer requirements for healthier foods; for example, \\nwhen seeking to develop product nutritional claims such as \\u2018reduced fat\\u2019 \\nor \\u2018reduced salt\\u2019.\\n11.3 Sensory quality assurance (QA) in the  \\npost-development product scale-up\\nSensory assessment plays an important role within the product scale-up \\nphase as it is vital to ensure that the product when manufactured on a full \\nindustrial scale still achieves all of the KSPs of the approved development \\nsample (as this is what the end customer will have agreed and therefore \\nwill be expecting to be delivered as the final product). All too often during \\nfactory trials of a new product there are problems encountered when trying \\nto match the factory product to the development kitchen samples which \\nhave been approved by the customer.\\nThe following are aspects of the scale-up process that can impact upon/\\ncause variations in the organoleptic properties of the factory-produced \\nproduct when compared to the development kitchen sample:\\nKIL11.indd   206 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 207\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\n\\u2022 Ingredients purchased on an industrial scale are typically not as \\u2018quality \\nconsistent\\u2019 as the development kitchen purchased and hand-prepared \\ningredients. Perhaps the \\u2018industrial scale supply\\u2019 meat/vegetable particu-\\nlates contain more \\u2018off-cuts\\u2019 or \\u2018fines\\u2019 which affect the appearance of the \\nend product. When preparing product samples for agreement with the \\ncustomer, the development department should be encouraged to always \\nuse factory grade ingredients, as using hand-selected \\u2018perfect\\u2019 ingredi-\\nents should be done only if such standards are consistently achievable \\nby the supplier at the price point intended. The exception to this may \\nsometimes be the use of hand-selected samples for product artwork, \\nalthough care must be taken not to mislead the consumer at this stage. \\nIf such points are not controlled then the business is likely to over-\\npromise and under-deliver in terms of product quality/consistency.\\n\\u2022 Production factors such as mixing/blending/cooking/holding times on an \\nindustrial scale in the factory typically take far longer than when making \\na very small quantity of product in the development kitchen. Such condi-\\ntions can lead to an increased potential for product texture breakdown, \\ncolour deterioration and flavour changes. The technologist who oversees \\nthe scale-up operation should select the best factory methods to mini-\\nmise such issues, make recommendations for more appropriate pieces \\nof equipment and limit maximum batch sizes wherever processing time \\nhas an adverse impact upon product organoleptic quality.\\n\\u2022 The development sample may only have been cooked to a very limited \\nextent in order to preserve texture, colour and flavour. However, in the \\nfull industrial process the product will also need to achieve certain shelf-\\nlife aspirations which often involve having to cook the product at higher \\ntemperatures or for longer periods of time in order to ensure a sufficient \\nlevel of microbiological reduction. Clearly there is therefore the poten-\\ntial for a reduction of organoleptic quality whilst seeking to achieve \\nproduct safety/shelf-life. As product safety is a non-negotiable product \\nrequirement, the scale-up technologist must ensure that the process and \\noperating times/temperatures selected achieve the required levels of \\nsafety and shelf-life whilst avoiding unacceptable levels of product \\norganoleptic deterioration caused by over-processing.\\n11.3.1 Shelf-life assessment\\nShelf-life assessment will typically involve holding the new product within \\nstorage and handling conditions that reflect both the product supply chain \\nand the holding conditions of the end consumer (most retailers/food service \\noperations will have pre-set criteria detailing the expected times, tempera-\\ntures and storage conditions of the shelf-life trials required for any products \\nwhich are to be sold through their operations). Shelf-life testing usually \\nrequires both microbiological and organoleptic assessment over the course \\nof the required shelf-life period (in some cases nutritional analysis will also \\nKIL11.indd   207 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n208 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nbe required to ensure that the nutritional performance of the product is as \\nrequired over shelf-life).\\nOften during the shelf-life assessment of a proposed new product, \\nsamples of the product will be despatched to a contract microbiology labo-\\nratory to be held at the required temperatures for the designated amounts \\nof time between microbiological tests. The storage temperatures during \\nsuch trials for chilled foods will usually be elevated to reflect the typically \\nhigher temperature storage conditions within the distribution chain and \\nconsumer storage (compared with the relatively low and consistent storage \\ntemperatures achievable within a closely controlled business chill store). It \\ncan sometimes be the product organoleptic performance that limits the \\ntotal product shelf-life rather than the overall product microbiological per-\\nformance. Therefore it is important to ensure that the organoleptic assess-\\nment of the product during shelf-life testing evaluates product samples that \\nhave been held in the same storage conditions (e.g. times and temperatures) \\nas the microbiological test samples.\\nTo aid process efficiencies and reduce wastage there will often be busi-\\nness commercial pressures to apply as long a shelf-life to products as is \\npossible. In such circumstances it can be tempting for a business to conduct \\nits shelf-life testing using \\u2018best case\\u2019/optimum storage conditions. However, \\nfailure to take account of \\u2018worst case\\u2019 or even just \\u2018real world\\u2019 storage con-\\nditions/factors may well lead to a business applying a length of shelf-life to \\nproducts which is based upon optimum storage control, rather than the real \\nworld storage conditions that the product is actually going to encounter \\nwithin the supply chain. Application of an inappropriately long shelf-life \\nmay result in consumer complaints of product deterioration before the \\u2018use \\nby\\u2019 date of the product has been reached and can lead to serious consumer \\nhealth issues and product recalls based upon product quality or safety \\ngrounds.\\nOften the simplest approach is to have the microbiological laboratory \\nhold both the microbiological and the organoleptic shelf-life test samples \\nwithin their storage incubators set at the required temperatures for the \\nrequired amounts of time. Each time a product is due for microbiological \\nassessment (at set points over the length of shelf-life to be assessed) the \\nlaboratory should also return the required number of samples back to the \\nmanufacturer for organoleptic shelf-life evaluation.\\nIt is also prudent to assess product shelf-life performance to a point \\nwhich is past the length of shelf-life that will be typically applied to the \\nproduct. Not only is this good practice in demonstrating due diligence that \\nthe shelf-life applied also allows for a margin of safety, but also by conduct-\\ning such tests the business will gain an understanding of the product char-\\nacteristics/features which are exhibited by the product as it deteriorates. In \\naddition there may be times in the future when the business would benefit \\nfrom an understanding of how long the product can actually last (e.g. \\nperhaps helpful in circumstances when the customer has queried the poten-\\nKIL11.indd   208 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 209\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\ntial for a shelf-life extension due to excess stock holding) and therefore \\nhaving already conducted such tests will prove to be invaluable in enabling \\na swift response.\\n11.4 Sensory quality assurance (QA) in  \\nthe production process\\n11.4.1 Definition of the required product organoleptic quality standard\\nThe end goal of the production process is to create a product which meets \\nthe customer\\u2019s expectations. Typically within the food manufacturing sector \\na sensory specification/standard for each product is used to aid product \\nquality assessment. The product profile of organoleptic expectations is often \\nwritten and agreed with the end customer at the time of product develop-\\nment or scale-up.\\nThis sensory description for each product should clearly define the spe-\\ncific organoleptic characteristics required to be achieved. This information \\nis usually defined under sections including appearance, aroma, taste and \\ntexture (Fig. 11.1). Photographs of the product can also be incorporated \\nwithin such sensory descriptions to further define the visual standard \\nrequired.\\nOne issue with regard to the use of end product sensory descriptions is \\nthat at certain stages within the production process the product may require \\nsensory assessment but will not yet be expected to meet the end product \\nsensory description. For example, pre-fried onions may require an organo-\\nleptic assessment to confirm that they are sufficiently soft and caramelised \\nprior to their addition to the sauce component of a chicken tikka masala \\nready meal.

The \\nBostwick consistometer (Fig. 11.2) determines the food sample consistency \\nby measuring the distance which the material flows under its own weight \\nover a set period of time. This enables the assessment of liquid food samples \\nagainst pre-set consistency/viscosity standards.\\nIt should be noted when using such equipment that product viscosity will \\nvary with product temperature. Typically the hotter the product, the less \\nviscous it will be. Such checks should therefore always be conducted at a set \\ntemperature point. Usually manufacturers will choose a set temperature \\nclose to the temperature that the product is likely to be at that point of \\nassessment. For example a pasteurised sauce to be assessed at the stage of \\ncooked batch completion may be assessed at 80 \\u00b0C, whereas a cold blend \\nsauce to be assessed at the point of batch completion may be assessed at \\n4 \\u00b0C. To ensure accuracy a calibrated hand probe should be used to confirm \\nthat the product is at the required temperature at the point of assessment.\\nAnother point of potential variation in results is that when assessing \\nsoups and sauces which contain particulates, the amount of particulates in \\neach small test sample will affect the flow rate/viscosity of the product. \\nTherefore it is common business practice, when assessing the viscosity of \\nparticulate sauces/soups, to always conduct a \\u2018sieved Bostwick\\u2019 where the \\nsample is sieved through a set size sieve to remove the particulates before \\nviscosity assessment in order to eliminate the \\u2018particulate variable\\u2019.\\nKIL11.indd   211 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n212 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nBrookfield viscometer\\nBrookfield viscometer (Fig. 11.3) are often used within the food processing \\nsectors where accurate bench-top analysis of product viscosity is needed. \\nBrookfield Viscometers use the principle of \\u2018rotational viscometry\\u2019, i.e. \\ntheir measurement of product viscosity is based upon immersing a specifi-\\ncally selected spindle within a sample of the product followed by measure-\\nment of the torque required to rotate the spindle at a set speed whilst \\nimmersed within the product sample.

Many food companies now rely on photo-\\ngraphic standards for colour assessments and often these standards will be \\nreviewed on the computer screen at the relevant food manufacturing \\nwork-station.\\nIn addition to supporting in-house process control, the use of specific test \\nequipment also enables the manufacturing operation to communicate and \\nwork to a common standard with suppliers/customers, helping to ensure \\nthat quality standards for raw material supply and end product acceptance \\nare clearly and objectively defined.\\n11.4.3 Ingredients\\nThere are a number of steps that can be taken to help achieve the consistent \\nsupply of correct quality ingredients to the food manufacturing operation. \\nThe use of \\u2018approved suppliers\\u2019 (where the supplier is assessed for control \\nof aspects such as product quality, safety and legality prior to being autho-\\nrised to supply) is a good start to the assurance of consistent ingredient \\nsupply.\\nPurchase to a pre-agreed ingredient specification which reflects the \\nquality performance requirements of the ingredient is an important factor. \\nBy having a clear understanding and definition of the intended end product \\nKSPs, checks can then focus upon ensuring that the ingredient KSPs are \\naligned with the end product specification.\\nDefinition of ingredient KSPs will include written description of the \\nsensory aspects of the ingredient, including its appearance, aroma, taste and \\ntexture. These specified KSPs can then be checked to confirm conformance \\nto requirements upon point of delivery. Consistent ingredient supply is \\nhighly reliant upon consistent processes and machinery at the supplier site; \\ntherefore, where possible supplier audits should seek to review the sup-\\nplier\\u2019s ability to achieve a consistently correct ingredient quality.\\nSensory assessment of incoming ingredients should be conducted by a \\nmember of staff who has been trained upon such checks and confirmed to \\nbe capable of reviewing each ingredient against its specified quality criteria. \\nThese checks may include raw or cooked product tests in order to confirm \\nthat the ingredient\\u2019s appearance, aroma, taste and texture meet the require-\\nments defined within the specification/sensory description.\\nIt is always important to ensure that a representative sample is taken \\nfrom the incoming goods to be assessed. Staff can be trained upon sampling \\namounts and techniques to ensure that various points of the delivery are \\nchecked (including coverage of the range of supplier lot/batch/date codes \\npresent).\\nWhere cook tests are required (for example for the organoleptic assess-\\nment of raw meats) it is important to ensure that appropriate assessment \\nKIL11.indd   214 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 215\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nfacilities/cooking equipment are consistently available to the operator, oth-\\nerwise there is a risk that checks will not be conducted. Also such tests can \\nbe time consuming and therefore it is important to ensure that operators \\nare trained to focus upon the checks and do not rush.\\nSensory related checks upon incoming ingredients include the \\nfollowing:\\n\\u2022 Vegetables (typically assessed raw unless cook rate/texture is a critical \\nfactor to check in advance of processing): size (including dice or slice \\ndimensions if applicable), texture, taste, aroma, colour, skin presence, \\nextraneous matter and soil presence.\\n\\u2022 Meats (typically visually assessed in a raw state, and then fully organo-\\nleptically assessed upon cooking): aroma, size (including dice, slice or \\nmince dimensions), visual lean, texture, colour, blood, gristle and extra-\\nneous matter.\\n\\u2022 Dairy products: colour, aroma, viscosity and taste.\\nFood manufacturers should consider the pro-active benefits of encourag-\\ning their suppliers to conduct pre-outload sensory assessment of the raw \\nmaterials, in order that by the time the ingredient reaches the manufactur-\\ning site it has already received a recent confirmatory check that it meets all \\nof the sensory criteria expected. Such a \\u2018right first time\\u2019 approach can help \\navoid a lot of disruption and cost to both operations.\\nA relevant point of note is to ensure that when agreeing a specified \\nstandard for ingredient assessment pre-despatch (at the supplier site) and \\nupon arrival at your manufacturing site, the same design/model of testing \\nequipment should ideally be used at both sites to help reduce the potential \\nfor variances in the testing approach taken. Also the test methods/condi-\\ntions need to be stipulated to ensure consistency between the two sites; for \\nexample, product viscosity will be affected by temperature and therefore \\nshould always be measured at a pre-agreed temperature to facilitate \\ncomparison.\\nOver time a business may wish to vary its frequency of checks upon each \\ningredient, with the extent of assessment dependent upon the supplier track \\nhistory of consistency of supply, the potential for major product/business \\nimpact in the event of a fault, and some ingredients may require extra focus \\nupon particular \\u2018at risk\\u2019 times of year with regard to consistency/seasonality \\nof supply. For example small dice/slice sizes of fresh processed carrots, \\nbecause of their high surface area, can be far more susceptible to spoilage \\nat certain times of the year. Such spoilage can result in an acidic flavour/\\naroma which, if the \\u2018off\\u2019 carrots were then accidentally used, would render \\nthe end product unsalable. As a consequence manufacturers may choose to \\nreduce the operating shelf-life of such ingredients at particular \\u2018known \\nissue\\u2019 times of year. It is often useful to build up a catalogue of these poten-\\ntial supply issues that can be used within a food production business for \\nstaff training and advanced warning purposes.\\nKIL11.indd   215 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n216 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nOften manufacturers will conduct incoming goods checks in the area \\nin which they are going to store the product as long delays whilst con-\\nducting checks in ambient conditions can have an adverse effect upon \\nboth the organoleptic and microbiological properties of chilled/frozen \\ningredients.\\n11.4.4 Ingredient supply changes, cost improvement initiatives and \\ningredient substitutions\\nThere can be many circumstances which will drive a business to replace a \\ncurrently supplied ingredient with another. Perhaps the supplier is unable \\nto achieve the consistency of supply required due to the order volumes \\nbeing too small, too big or too infrequent. Perhaps there s a business initia-\\ntive to improve the nutritional status of the end product (e.g. reduced salt \\nor reduced fat projects). Another potential reason is that of \\u2018cost control\\u2019 \\nor \\u2018margin protection\\u2019, where a cheaper supply is therefore being sought. \\nAlso there is the possibility that the usual manufacturing site unexpectedly \\ndoes not have the ingredient available and therefore the business needs to \\nuse a substitute ingredient in order to avoid significant disruption in their \\nproduction/delivery plan.\\nIt is important to highlight at this stage that when seeking to make \\nadjustments to the ingredients used a business must ensure that it is in \\ncontrol of key factors such as ingredient declaration changes, any food \\nsafety/allergen status changes and impacts upon end product specifications/\\ncustomer approval. Changes in some ingredient characteristics which ini-\\ntially appear to be minor, can sometimes make the difference between the \\nend product being safe or unsafe. For example when evaluating a new \\nchopped tomato product for use as a base ingredient within fresh, cold-\\nblended salsa sauces/dips, if the new chopped tomato supply is not as acidic \\nas the previously used ingredient then there is the significant potential that \\nthe resultant end product will not be as acidic and will therefore be more \\nsusceptible to spoilage and potentially pathogen presence/growth.\\nWhen considering proposed new ingredients it is also important to \\nensure that the end product quality is not going to be adversely affected by \\nany such ingredient changes and therefore, in advance of progression to \\nfactory trials of any new ingredient, sample assessment using sensory evalu-\\nation techniques can help to ensure that the proposed new ingredient is \\nlikely to be successful.\\nThere is the temptation for suppliers to provide perfect hand-selected \\nsamples at the initial sales phases which can sometimes give an unrealistic \\nimpression of the quality and consistency of the ingredient to be supplied. \\nIt is therefore important to always request factory-produced samples from \\nthe suppliers of proposed new ingredients to ensure that the product being \\nassessed is representative of the product to be supplied on an ongoing \\nbasis.\\nKIL11.indd   216 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 217\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nOrganoleptic assessment of the proposed new ingredient against the \\nrequired ingredient specification and against a sample drawn from the \\ncurrent supply is a typical approach used by businesses when evaluating \\nthe adequacy of a proposed new ingredient. Such checks are usually con-\\nducted by a company panel, consisting of staff who have confirmed their \\ncompetence in sensory evaluation (often quality and development staff), \\nand involve the review (uncooked or cooked as appropriate) of aspects such \\nas ingredient appearance, aroma, taste and texture (and also viscosity \\nassessment for liquid products).\\nIn business often there can be resistance to change. Some staff will have \\ntheir preferred suppliers, perhaps due to relationships that have been built \\nover many years of supply. Other staff may be influenced by thoughts that \\nif a proposed new ingredient is cheaper then it cannot possibly be as good \\nas the currently supplied ingredient. Staff may be risk averse, feeling that \\nany changes may have the potential to damage the end product/business \\nreputation.\\nIn order to avoid such matters from clouding the fair evaluation of an \\ningredient, drawing together an ingredient sensory evaluation panel and \\napplying \\u2018Difference testing\\u2019 or \\u2018Preference testing\\u2019 methods can be used \\nto overcome any bias and provide objective rather than subjective responses.\\nWhen conducting such evaluation panels often an ingredient may be \\ndistinguishable as different from the current supply when assessed in \\nisolation, but when that ingredient is present within the intended multi-\\ncomponent end products the difference in performance cannot be distin-\\nguished. A business that does not consider such aspects may be missing \\nout on potential supply benefits and cost savings. Therefore sometimes \\nthe most appropriate way to evaluate a proposed ingredient change is \\nvia review of the ingredient performance in the end product and not in \\nisolation.\\nEvaluation of the proposed ingredient performance within the end \\nproduct may also be appropriate when the characteristics of that ingredient \\nmake it very difficult to judge objectively when in isolation. For example \\nextra-mature blue Stilton cheese crusts may be purchased for their excellent \\nstrength of flavour when added to certain soups and sauces, but when eaten \\non their own some may find such ingredients overpowering. As a conse-\\nquence may select the mildest sample during preference testing, which \\nactually would not provide the same extent of flavour performance as the \\nstronger sample once added to the end product.\\nSome ingredients within a business manufacturing multicomponent food \\nproducts may be widely used across a large number of products. With regard \\nto sauce and soup manufacture such ingredients may include tomatoes, \\nmilks and creams which are often used as the background for soup and \\nsauce products, diced/sliced vegetables frequently used as a particulate or \\nblended component, and herbs/spices which are typically used to add extra \\nflavour.\\nKIL11.indd   217 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n218 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nClearly any change to an ingredient which is used within many different \\nproducts has the potential to cause widespread problems if the change is \\nnot controlled and ensured to be appropriate. For these reasons it is impor-\\ntant when considering such ingredient changes that \\u2018worst case\\u2019 scenarios \\nare considered, i.e. conducting kitchen or factory production trials upon the \\nproducts which contain the highest quantities or are most influence  by the \\ningredient that is being considered for change. Sometimes the result may \\nbe that a new ingredient is approved for use only in recipes where it is used \\nat a low level (e.g. below a threshold of noticeability/influence upon the \\nKSPs of the end product).\\nDuring all testing and evaluation of ingredients and their subsequent \\nperformance within the end products it is important to focus upon the \\naspects of the end product that the consumer would miss/notice when influ-\\nenced by a change in the characteristics of an ingredient. Will the end \\nconsumer notice the change? If so, will the consumer feel that the change \\nmakes the product better or worse, or will the consumer feel that the change \\nhas made no difference at all to their enjoyment of the product? It is impor-\\ntant to bear in mind whether or not proposed changes are going to be \\ncommunicated to the end consumer. If consumers are told that there is a \\ndifference then they will expect and seek to find a difference.\\n11.4.5 Packaging\\nThe delivery packaging of the ingredients can serve many functions includ-\\ning protection from physical damage, microbiological spoilage, contamina-\\ntion and flavour taints over shelf-life. Alongside these key factors it is worth \\nensuring that the ingredient delivery format facilitates a good range of \\ningredient assessment, including sensory evaluation, upon arrival. Factors \\nsuch as ensuring that all parts of a delivery can be accessed for inspection \\nalways need to be considered (e.g. vegetable delivery suppliers may use \\nDolavs or cages which can sometimes lead to certain individual ingredient \\npacks being inaccessible until the whole load is unpacked).\\nIn addition it may be costly to open packaging formats such as vacuum \\npacked meats for evaluation immediately upon delivery if the ingredient is \\nnot to be used until many days after delivery (as opening will allow air into \\nthe pack which will consequently reduce the shelf-life of the amount of \\ningredient remaining in the pack following testing). For such reasons the \\nmanufacturing operation may decide to defer a full assessment of the ingre-\\ndient quality until nearer the time of use (but not so near that there would \\nbe insufficient time to deal with any problems arising from this inspection), \\nor perhaps arrange for a smaller \\u2018sample pack\\u2019 to be sent alongside the main \\nlarger delivery packs.

Whilst some ingredients (including chilled cut vegeta-\\nbles) will typically be used within a few days of arrival on site, many longer \\nshelf-life ingredients may be stored for weeks or months before being \\nrequired for use. It is therefore advisable for a business to monitor these \\ningredients during their storage phase for factors including organoleptic \\nperformance, as such checks will provide advanced notice of any developing \\nKIL11.indd   219 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n220 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nquality deterioration issue and therefore ensure sufficient time to rectify \\nthe matter without disruption to the business production plan.\\nRoutine checks during storage can also include review of the condition \\nof the ingredient packaging, as damage and poor seals can allow air ingress \\nwhich may accelerate spoilage, drying or oxidative reactions. An ever-\\nincreasing amount of foods are now reliant upon vacuum packaging or \\nmodified atmosphere packaging (MAP) for the achievement of their shelf-\\nlives and therefore a small seal failure across a batch if unnoticed can soon \\nlead to a major failure in organoleptic performance and possibly food safety \\nissues.\\nEnsuring that all ingredients are held within appropriate storage condi-\\ntions is a key factor in assuring their consistent organoleptic performance \\nover the course of their shelf-life. Optimal storage conditions will benefit \\neach ingredient and typically a multicomponent ready meal, soup or sauce \\nmanufacturing business will have chilled product stores running at below \\n+4 \\u00b0C and frozen goods stores running at below -18 \\u00b0C. With regard to \\nchilled and frozen products, high air flow conditions can significantly dry \\nany exposed product (in frozen products this is known as \\u2018freezer burn\\u2019 and \\ncan be protected against through thorough containment within the primary \\npackaging). Higher than ideal storage temperatures can encourage micro-\\nbiological growth which, in addition to the associated food safety issues, can \\nalso cause flavour taints and deterioration in product texture.\\nFurther assurance of organoleptic performance can be gained by instal-\\nlation of recording and alarm systems upon chills and freezers to confirm \\nthat the optimum running conditions are being consistently achieved. Rela-\\ntive humidity could also be monitored and controlled in dry goods stores, \\nas too much moisture within the air can lead to clumping of powders and \\nthe potential for elevated levels of microbial spoilage.\\n11.4.7 Ingredient shelf-life extension\\nOccasionally in food manufacturing operations there will be circumstances \\nwhere the business has a surplus of a particular ingredient which when \\nassessed against predicted usage rates would be at risk of exceeding its site \\nprocess use by/best before date before being scheduled for use. Such cir-\\ncumstances can occur due to over-ordering (perhaps resulting from a \\nmistake or due to planning to predicted orders which have turned out to \\nbe unrealistically high) or perhaps due to delays in the production plan \\ncaused by line breakdowns.\\nIf it is not possible to pull forward the next production date, in an attempt \\nto save the cost of ingredient stock losses food production businesses will \\nsometimes seek to extend the shelf-life of the ingredients at risk of going \\nout of date through factors such as formal review and agreement of shelf-\\nlife extensions with the particular ingredient supplier, or sometimes will \\nconsider the freezing of the particular \\u2018at risk\\u2019 ingredient stocks which \\nKIL11.indd   220 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 221\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nwould otherwise have perished before the date of the next scheduled use \\nif continued to be stored in chilled conditions. In such circumstances the \\nuse of sensory evaluation plays an important role in confirming that the \\ndecision to extend the shelf-life of the ingredient does not adversely affect \\nto an unacceptable extent the ingredient organoleptic properties, and as a \\nconsequence does not pose a threat to the quality of the end product.\\nIt should be noted that when considering the potential for ingredient \\nshelf-life extensions that the primary concern must always be that of product \\nsafety. (For example, during the additional shelf-life required is there a risk \\nof the safety of the ingredient being compromised?) If through a combina-\\ntion of detailed product/process knowledge and liaison with the ingredient \\nsupplier it can be ascertained that the application of additional shelf-life \\nwould not pose a threat to food safety, then it would be appropriate to \\nconduct a thorough sensory assessment in order to also confirm that the \\nextended shelf life ingredient will still deliver (and not threaten to damage) \\nthe required KSPs within the final product.\\nShelf-life extension checks should be conducted by experienced members \\nof the technical, quality and development teams, who have first-hand expe-\\nrience of the usual organoleptic properties of the specific ingredient, and \\nare well aware of the likely signs of deterioration or spoilage. Such signs \\ncan include off-aromas and off-flavours, colour deterioration and texture \\nchanges (e.g. perhaps a change to become slimy or dry).\\nPoints for consideration during such organoleptic assessments to under-\\npin shelf-life extensions include ensuring that a representative sample size \\nis being assessed from the ingredient stock in question, as the early signs of \\ningredient deterioration may be localised and not yet widespread across an \\ningredient batch. Businesses should also consider the balance of \\u2018risk to \\nreward\\u2019. If by applying an ingredient shelf-life extension the business is \\nsaving only a small amount of ingredient or money and has plenty of \\u2018within \\nstandard shelf life\\u2019 material in stock, is it worth the time, trouble and end \\nproduct quality performance risk to extend the shelf-life of the ingredient \\nstock?\\nIt should also be noted that the end customer, be it a supermarket or \\nfood service business, may have a supplier policy upon whether they autho-\\nrise (or need to be advised of) the procedure of controlled extensions to \\ningredient shelf-lives. Therefore with regard to ingredient shelf-life exten-\\nsions it is always wise for the manufacturer to check their customer policies \\nbefore considering how to proceed with the best interests of all parties in \\nmind.\\n11.4.8 Recipe preparation phase\\nThis processing stage typically involves the removal of the ingredients \\nfrom their primary packaging and measurement into their required recipe \\nweights to await further processing. This is therefore usually the first point \\nKIL11.indd   221 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n222 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nin the production process at which 100% of each ingredient can be handled \\nand closely reviewed. Such circumstances therefore provide a key control \\npoint for ensuring that each ingredient meets the organoleptic quality \\nrequired.\\nSome intake checks may have been deferred until the preparation phase \\nto avoid the potential for ingredient deterioration caused by opening the \\npackaging at an earlier stage, or perhaps a supplier ingredient delivery \\ncomprising of numerous separate batches which for further assurance of \\nproduct quality all require an individual check at this stage. Quality checks \\nat this stage could be classed as \\u2018vigilance\\u2019 by the factory preparation staff \\nwho should be trained to ensure that each ingredient being prepared con-\\nsistently appears to meet the quality standards required.\\nPreparation staff should be made aware that each ingredient may have \\nbeen stored on site for a significant amount of time and therefore could \\nhave deteriorated since delivery. Staff should also understand that whilst \\ningredients may have passed an inspection upon intake, the checker at that \\nstage is only likely to have viewed a small percentage sample of that ingre-\\ndient, whereas at the preparation stage all of the batch of that ingredient \\ncan be inspected to at least some extent. It is important therefore that staff \\nsee themselves far more as a key operators who are providing a vital QA \\nrole in monitoring product quality and questioning any issues, rather than \\nas team members who have a relatively narrow remit of only weighing \\ningredients.\\nIn a manufacturing business where many product recipes are being pro-\\ncessed on a daily basis it is unlikely that production staff will be able to \\nremember the key attributes of each specific ingredient, and it is also \\nunlikely that production staff would have the time to cross-reference every \\ningredient being processed against a written specification/description. \\nHowever, the relevant production staff could be trained upon an appropri-\\nate \\u2018top five organoleptic quality points\\u2019 or \\u2018key quality criteria\\u2019 for each \\ningredient group (e.g. meats, dairy, vegetables, herbs, spices) to enable them \\nto be particularly vigilant during the handling of every ingredient. Such \\nquality check points could include: Does the ingredient match its name \\ngiven upon the recipe sheet? (For example, Does the ingredient look like \\n10 mm Diced Streaky Smoked Rindless Bacon?) Are the appearance, \\ncolour and aroma as expected?\\nMost companies prefer their operators not to taste test the ingredients \\nduring the processing operation as such practices can be linked to poor \\nhygienic practice and can set a poor example to other staff. However, in \\nsome circumstances a taste check will provide a vital point of quality assur-\\nance and therefore each business should decide upon the appropriate \\namount of taste testing for their particular operation and the location at \\nwhich the taste testing should take place. Potentially such testing could take \\nplace within a designated area of the factory, perhaps a tasting table/booth \\ncould be set up in order to further highlight to staff that the tasting of \\nKIL11.indd   222 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 223\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\ningredients forms a key part of QA and should only be conducted in the \\ndesignated area and at the appropriate stages of the process.\\n11.4.9 Work in progress (WIP) storage\\nManufacturing operations need to ensure that the selected prepare  ingre-\\ndient storage methods do not have an adverse impact upon the organoleptic \\nperformance of the ingredient. Often manufacturers of multicomponent \\nfoods will ensure that the ingredient (or ingredient mix) is stored in lidded \\nfood grade plastic containers. The term \\u2018food grade\\u2019 expects that the sup-\\nplier of the container has selected/tested the material to ensure that it does \\nnot impart any flavours, taints or chemical compounds detrimental to the \\nsafety or quality of the ingredients to be contained.\\nClear labelling is important at this stage as the primary packaging is often \\nno longer present and the ingredient will therefore usually have a reduced \\n\\u2018prepared shelf-life\\u2019 which should be recorded upon the containers together \\nwith identification of the ingredient and the destination product/batch. \\nUsually the prepared shelf-life of each ingredient is kept as short as possible \\nto help ensure the ingredient\\u2019s quality at point of use.\\nWhilst the quality monitoring of work in progress (WIP) is often con-\\nfined to routine checks upon the prepared ingredient storage areas to \\nensure that the required holding conditions are being maintained and that \\nnone of the ingredients has exceeded is \\u2018prepared shelf-life\\u2019, sensory assess-\\nment will be required typically in the event of an ingredient quality query, \\nor in the circumstances where the standard \\u2018prepared shelf-life\\u2019 has been \\nexceeded (perhaps due to production delays or breakdowns) and the \\nfactory therefore requires a decision upon whether the prepared ingredient \\nis still acceptable for use. Where shelf-life extension is to be considered the \\nprimary consideration must always be that of product safety. The points \\ndocumented within Section 11.4.7 are equally as relevant in these circum-\\nstances at the WIP production stage.\\n11.4.10 Processing: mixing and cooking operations\\nAs with the preparation stage, the mixing/cooking stage is also a phase in \\nthe operation at which staff will have the opportunity to review and inspect \\nall of the ingredients to be used within the production batch. This processing \\nstage therefore provides another key QA point via monitoring that each \\ningredient meets the organoleptic standards required.\\nStaff who are trained in the sensory review of ingredients at this stage \\nwill be of great advantage to the food manufacturing operation. Ensuring \\nthat each ingredient to be added to the batch is of the quality standards \\nrequired is a key element of a food manufacturer\\u2019s QA system.\\nDuring their training the processing staff should be briefed upon the \\nneed for ingredient quality awareness at all times, and the importance of \\nKIL11.indd   223 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n224 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nnot assuming that the ingredient quality is bound to be correct just on the \\nbasis that the ingredient has passed other check points to reach this particu-\\nlar stage of the process. Often it is beneficial to highlight to processing staff \\nthat if they do not spot an ingredient problem prior to use, that ingredient \\nissue could then lead to an end product quality fault which may not be \\ntraceable back to that particular raw material fault, and consequently may \\nleave the process operator open to suspicion that they may have incorrectly \\nprocessed the product. Such an approach can help ensure that operators \\nremain vigilant and always question any ingredient quality issues that they \\nare not entirely sure upon.\\nAt the cooking/mixing stage there are a lot of ingredient physical and \\nchemical interactions occurring (e.g. Maillard reactions, blending or soften-\\ning of particulates, formation of oil-in-water emulsions). In an ideal world \\napplying the same cooking/mixing process (times, temperatures, mixing/\\nblending speeds, etc.) would result in exactly the same end product on every \\noccasion. However, as most food production operations are dealing with \\nnatural ingredients which can vary in variety, source and season, and also \\nvary in factors such as their temperature and age upon addition to the \\nproduct mix, such variations in the ingredients will often lead to variations \\nin the processing performance of the end product.\\nIt is also not uncommon for manufacturing sites to possess a variety of \\nprocessing equipment which can be used to produce the end products (e.g. \\ndicers, slicers, mixers, blenders, homogenisers, cookers, packing machinery, \\nchillers), and yet depending upon which equipment is available/selected, \\nthere can be variability in terms of the end results achieved (for example, \\nmixers, agitators and pumps will vary in their degree of damage caused to \\nthe food product).\\nAs a result of the variables detailed above, in order to ensure that the \\nend product meets the required sensory standards (e.g. appearance, aroma, \\ntaste, texture, viscosity), ideally the product sensory description will have \\nbeen written and agreed in a form which allows for an acceptable range of \\nproduct variability from one batch to the next. For example with regard to \\nsoups and sauces the colour reference may allow a shade either side of the \\nideal colour, and the product viscosity may allow for a set amount of devia-\\ntion from the standard target. As variation is a fact of life for most process-\\ning operations handling natural ingredients, the processing team often have \\nto assess the product at key stages within the production flow, and make \\nadjustments to the processing parameters in order to ensure that the desired \\nend result is achieved.\\nSuch checks and corrective actions typically involve sensory assessment \\nof the product/batch at the point of phase completion, and before progres-\\nsion to the next stage of the operation (typically a cooling or packing stage). \\nA sufficiently sized sample should be drawn from the most appropriate \\npoints in the batch (if the production batch is known to vary at certain \\npoints then all such points should be assessed) and the product should then \\nKIL11.indd   224 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 225\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nbe evaluated by the production operator or nominated quality assurance \\noperative against the appropriate product sensory description (see Fig. 11.1 \\nfor an example sensory description for chicken tikka masala). The selected \\nassessor should have been trained and screened in advance to confirm that \\nthey are capable of end product sensory analysis. Such staff training would \\ntypically take the form of the measures outlined earlier in this chapter.\\nUpon sensory assessment, if the product meets all of the defined require-\\nments then it can be allowed to progress to the next process stage. However, \\nif a non-conformance is raised at this stage then corrective action will typi-\\ncally be required. Corrective actions in soups and sauces may include:\\n\\u2022 addition of water if the batch is too thick;\\n\\u2022 extra cooking if the batch particulates are too firm;\\n\\u2022 extra homogenisation if the batch texture is too coarse;\\n\\u2022 addition of more thickening agent (e.g. starch) if the batch requires \\ngreater viscosity;\\n\\u2022 addition of extra particulates if the product texture has broken down.\\nMany such corrective actions have an impact upon the product recipe and \\nconsequently the ingredient declaration. It is therefore prudent to have \\nagreed the appropriate and acceptable corrective actions with the relevant \\nauthorities and customers in advance. Any product adjustments should also \\nbe logged upon the process records to ensure full traceability.\\nA similar approach can also be taken when assessing the results of \\nintermediate stage processes (e.g. pre-frying minced beef before addition \\nto a bolognaise sauce, or perhaps pre-blending a starch/powder slurry \\nmix before addition to a batch of soup). As previously mentioned, such \\nassessments will require specific sensory standards to be written. At their \\nsimplest these standards could be one-line reminders placed upon the \\nprocess sheets (for example \\u2018Check that the slurry mix is lump free before \\naddition to the batch\\u2019), or could be a more complex full sensory descrip-\\ntion (e.g. appearance, aroma, taste, and texture guidance for a batch of \\npar-cooked pilau rice which will then complete its cook at a later process-\\ning stage).\\nAs such product assessments and adjustments can be quite time consum-\\ning, and are typically conducted by production staff whose Key Perfor-\\nmance Indicators often include \\u2018speed of operation\\u2019/\\u2018throughput rates\\u2019, it is \\ntherefore important that these production operatives are encouraged not \\nto rush their work related to QA. Production staff are often time pressured \\nto complete the current product and move on to the next product in the \\nplan. However, it must be stressed to the operators that the primary con-\\ncerns of their role are the safety and quality of the food products and that \\ntherefore it is far more cost effective to take a little extra time to get the \\nproduct \\u2018right first time\\u2019.\\nAny batch recipe or process corrections/adjustments should be formally \\nfed back to the team member responsible for setting the production process/\\nKIL11.indd   225 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n226 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nproduction sheets (typically a \\u2018process technologist\\u2019) as the requirement to \\nroutinely have to adjust a particular product may suggest that the standard \\nproduction process requires a permanent adjustment or re-trialling in order \\nto increase the chances of first time success, and avoid the requirement for \\ntime-consuming corrective action every time that particular product is \\nmade. It is very important that where an operator has highlighted that there \\nhas been an issue which required \\u2018in-process correction\\u2019, the person respon-\\nsible for adjusting future productions to avoid a recurrence of the issue \\nshould always feed-back to the operator what corrective measures have \\nbeen taken. The production operator will then feel that their feedback has \\nbeen valued and will be focused upon highlighting other opportunities for \\nimprovement in the future. In circumstances where operators feel that their \\nfeedback is not listened to or that \\u2018we always have problems on this product\\u2019 \\nthere is a danger of acceptance of less than ideal quality standards and a \\nloss of quality focus over time.\\nWith regard to the physical provision of sensory descriptions to the \\nfactory operators for reference against when conducting their product \\nsensory checks, processing operations take different approaches, each of \\nwhich can be effective providing that they are managed and monitored \\ncarefully with close focus upon document control and issue of updates as \\nand when required. Common approaches include:\\n\\u2022 printing a summary of the product sen ory description upon the relevant \\nproduction process instruction sheets (e.g. the mixing/cooking sheet);\\n\\u2022 holding copies of all product sensory descriptions in files within the \\nrelevant processing areas;\\n\\u2022 maintaining an electronic database of sensory descriptions which can be \\naccessed at a computer terminal or printed out when required.\\nAll batch assessment checks should be recorded to maintain full trace-\\nability within the operation and help prove in the event of an issue/ \\ncomplaint that the batch was correct at that particular point in the opera-\\ntion. In addition the recording of such results and any further corrective \\nactions can also be used to trend analyse the product over time for any \\nroutine problems or seasonal variances. (For example, perhaps variation \\nwith regard to colour, flavour or texture which could be linked to seasonally \\nvarying produce. If the extent of such seasonal variability is unacceptable \\nthen a solution may be to opt to use a frozen version of the variable ingre-\\ndients, which has been harvested and frozen at one set point in the year, \\nand is then available to be used consistently all year round.)\\nIn batch production processes, where a number of separate batches of \\nthe same product are to be produced sequentially, a technique that is often \\nalso used during sensory assessment is that of maintaining a reference \\nsample of each of the previous batches for review against as each new batch \\nis made. Such comparison enables a check to ensure that the product per-\\nformance is not gradually drifting away from the required standard.\\nKIL11.indd   226 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 227\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\n11.4.11  Delays/holding times upon completion of the batch (or at key \\nstages of the batch/product process)\\nIn many production processes, following operations such as cooking/mixing, \\nand prior to packing there is the potential for a delay/holding time between \\nsuch process stages.

For example in ready meal manufacture, rice which has \\nbeen cooked and chilled will ideally be used immediately but may be stored \\nin a refrigerated area for approximately 24 hours before packing as a com-\\nponent into the final ready meal packs (e.g. \\u2018Sweet and sour chicken with \\negg fried rice\\u2019). In such a scenario there is the potential during this holding \\ntime for the rice to become dry/hard, especially if it has been stored uncov-\\nered and placed in a chill store area which has a high air flow.\\nIt is therefore important not only to set an optimised storage method \\nand maximum amount of time before the component can no longer be used \\n(in ready meal production such limiting of holding times can be as much \\nrelated to product microbiological control as to product organoleptic \\ncontrol), but also to ensure that there is a confirmatory organoleptic assess-\\nment upon the component appearance, aroma, taste and texture before \\nfurther processing/packing. At this stage if the component quality is found \\nto have deteriorated beyond an acceptable point, the business would incur \\nfurther significant product, time and packaging cost losses by continuing to \\nprocess the product, only to realise later at final product analysis stage that \\na specific component has caused the entire product to be organoleptically \\nunacceptable. Well-timed sensory checks serve to ensure product quality \\nand help avoid incurring unnecessary costs by highlighting faults as early \\nas possible.\\n11.4.12 Product packing\\nThe process of packing the product following the recipe mix/cooking opera-\\ntion can have significant impacts upon the product\\u2019s organoleptic perfor-\\nmance. For example, when manufacturing soups and sauces the products \\nwill typically have been transferred from the recipe mix/cooking operation \\nvia a series of vessels, pipework and pumps (which may or may not have \\nbeen designed to handle the product as gently as possible) and will often \\nthen be held in an agitated vessel during the packing process in order to \\nensure a consistent mix/blend. In addition, if the products are being hot-\\nfilled into the packaging then the products will be hot and therefore con-\\ntinuing to cook whilst awaiting being packed into the final product \\npackaging.\\nHeat and agitation factors will lead to organoleptic effects such as the \\nsoftening of particulates, deterioration of starches/gels, colour and viscosity \\nchanges and therefore often the process technologist who has scaled-up the \\nproduct will have set a maximum batch size related to the rate at which the \\nKIL11.indd   227 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n228 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nproduct can be packed. (This packing rate is usually dictated by the speed \\nof the packing machines, and sometimes by the cooling/freezing capacity of \\nthe operation post-packing.) The technologist may calculate and set such \\nmaximum holding times by organoleptically assessing trial batches during \\nthe course of the batch packing operation until the point is reached where \\nthe product has deteriorated past a point of acceptability.\\nAny delays in the packing operation (perhaps due to machinery break-\\ndown) may incur further deterioration of the food. In order to reduce the \\nadverse impacts of such delays upon the end product in soup and sauce \\noperations, factories will often choose to turn off the agitation of the batch \\nduring the delay to reduce the physical impacts upon the product, and \\nwhere batches are held hot, a factory may also choose to reduce the holding \\ntemperature during the time of the delay (whilst ensuring that the tempera-\\nture reduction does not fall below a point where microbiological growth \\nmay become an issue).\\nIn the event of delays, food businesses will benefit from use of a \\u2018delay \\nprocedure\\u2019 (a summary of all of the actions required to be taken in the \\nevent of a process delay) which not only seeks to minimise the organoleptic \\nimpacts upon the product, but also ensures that the product quality is moni-\\ntored closely during the delay (typically via the requirement for routine \\nproduct assessments conducted by key staff) in order that the factory is \\nquickly aware of when the delayed batch has gone past the point of being \\nacceptable to pack. Where particulate deterioration in soups and sauces is \\na key concern, samples of the product may be routinely sieved to enable \\ncloser visual examination of the particulates. Sometimes colour change may \\nbe the main concern, requiring routine comparison against colour charts \\nduring the course of the delay.\\nThe physical packing process through vessels, agitators, pumps, pistons \\nand pipework can also have product quality impacts, which will be further \\nmagnified if a significant proportion of the product is being recycled within \\nthe process, perhaps due to product being reworked back into the batch \\npre-packing/holding system (e.g. if the packing of the batch is encountering \\nmachine problems causing a high level of pack weight or seal integrity \\nrejects which are then being reworked to save wastage).\\nThe significant scope for product organoleptic variation at the packing \\nphase usually leads to businesses placing a great deal of organoleptic scru-\\ntiny upon samples drawn from the final product at the start, middle and end \\nof the batch. Sometimes such checks are conducted even more frequently/\\nthroughout the packing operation if particular problems are being encoun-\\ntered; for example, excessive variability in particulate distribution which \\ntherefore requires further analysis to monitor and ascertain the root cause \\nof the issue.\\nIn soup/sauce batch production, focus upon a \\u2018distribution issue\\u2019 may \\nnecessitate routine \\u2018washouts\\u2019 of packs to ascertain the consistency of dis-\\ntribution of particulates across the packed batch (i.e. whether all of the \\nKIL11.indd   228 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 229\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nproduct components are evenly present throughout the batch). Some par-\\nticulates may sink or float when the batch is being packed which can lead \\nto their being present mostly at the start or end of the batch. Also if certain \\nlarger size particulates are becoming blocked in the feed pipes/dosing \\npistons this may lead to their sporadic distribution as every so often the \\npressure may build up until a burst of those stuck particulates are finally \\ndosed into the packaging.\\n11.4.13  Pre- or post-packing \\u2018cooling/chilling\\u2019 phases and the sensory \\nevaluation of the end product\\nOrganoleptic deterioration is also a consideration in the product cooling/\\nchilling phases. For example, if the product is cooled in an open state, the \\nchilled air flow that it is exposed to may cause some drying of the product, \\nwhereas if a product is cooled in its packaging, although this may protect \\nthe product from the drying effect of chilled air flows, the product can \\nsometimes be found to take longer to cool due to the insulating effect of \\nthe packaging, which can also cause organoleptic changes. In addition, some \\ncooling/chilling operations may require the product to be agitated, or may \\nrequire the outer edges of the product to be crust frozen. Such aspects of \\ncooling processes will also impact upon the organoleptic performance of \\nthe end product.\\nOnly after the product has been packed and cooled can a business start \\nto be confident that its organoleptic quality tests are assessing the product \\nin a form that the end consumer is likely to experience. Therefore the final \\nproduct sensory evaluation of aspects including appearance, aroma, taste \\nand texture is a very important stage of the business QA system. At this \\nstage businesses will often evaluate a number of samples drawn from the \\nstart, middle and end areas of the production batch, the number of which \\nshould reflect the potential for variability within the production process. \\nFood manufacturers will typically ensure that these checks are conducted \\nimmediately upon the completed end product by an experienced member \\nof the cooling/packing teams or by a QA technician.\\n11.4.14  Taste panel\\nMost food manufacturers will also place all recently completed products \\nupon a routine (often daily) business taste panel which is attended by a \\nmultidisciplinary cross section of the business staff and management. It is \\nusually beneficial for the end product taste panel to include members of \\nthe NPD department, process development and sales teams, as these team \\nmembers will often be able to closely remember the customer\\u2019s expecta-\\ntions of the particular products and how these expectations should be \\nreflected within the KSPs of each particular product. Also having members \\nof the factory production and QA teams present at the formal end product \\nKIL11.indd   229 3/12/2010   7:55:52 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n230 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\ntaste panel will help ensure a good transfer of product sensory knowledge \\nand provide the opportunity to discuss any particular processing issues/\\nproblems being encountered.\\nMost end product taste panels will assess a representative sample of each \\nproduction batch against the sensory description (Fig. 11.1) set either inter-\\nnally or with the end customer. Some businesses choose to score the attend-\\nee\\u2019s assessment of each batch, while others choose a simple \\u2018pass/fail\\u2019 \\napproach. The more data that can be captured at this stage, the greater the \\npotential for trend analysis of results over time. Such results can be used to \\ndrive business focus upon product quality (e.g. trend analysis of end product \\ntaste panel results may show a gradual deterioration in a product\\u2019s colour \\nor texture over time which, owing to the gradual drift in standard, may not \\nhave been picked up by the individuals regularly attending each taste \\npanel).\\nThere is also a good case for insisting that during the taste panel product \\nassessment phase, every panellist should evaluate each sample in silence or \\nisolation from other panellists to ensure that their judgement cannot be \\ninfluenced in any way by more dominant, opinionated or senior members \\nof the panel. Potentially some panel members may be biased in their opin-\\nions upon the acceptability of products due to pressures such as production \\nthroughputs, financial impacts or customer demands.\\nAs the end product taste panel will typically be the most thorough \\norganoleptic evaluation that the product is going to receive on site, busi-\\nnesses should seek to ensure that the taste panels take place before the \\nparticular batches of products are due to be despatched to the customer. \\nThis will ensure that if a product is found at the business taste panel to be \\nunacceptable (or in need of further scrutiny), then the product will still be \\nwithin the control of the business, rather than incurring the difficult situa-\\ntion of having to consider a withdrawal/recall from the distribution chain \\nor customer.\\n11.4.15 Freezing\\nIf the end product is intended to be sold in a frozen format then there are \\noften extra organoleptic factors to be considered and monitored via the use \\nof sensory assessment during the product/process design phase and the \\nsubsequent production quality assurance phase. These considerations \\ninclude the fact that the freezing of food products will form ice crystals \\nwithin the food. Typically, the slower the freezing process, the larger the ice \\ncrystals formed and therefore the greater the potential to damage the food \\nproduct structure (including deterioration of the physical texture of particu-\\nlates and damage to product starch/gel suspensions, which can lead to \\nexcessive product syneresis upon defrost).\\nOther organoleptic quality issues that can arise at the product freezing \\nphase are the potential for \\u2018freezer burn\\u2019 (quality deterioration typically \\nKIL11.indd   230 3/12/2010   7:55:52 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 231\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\ncaused by product dehydration and oxidation, often linked to the product \\nnot being sufficiently wrapped in protective packaging) and also the poten-\\ntial for product quality loss during storage, which is especially a concern \\nfor products which are particularly susceptible to deterioration (for \\nexample, high-fat meat products can be particularly prone to rancidity \\nduring frozen storage). Poorly maintained freezer stores can also increase \\nthe potential for product deterioration due to significant fluctuations in air \\ntemperature.\\n11.4.16 Storage (Including monitoring over shelf-life)\\nBusiness efficiency pressures to produce larger product batch runs less \\nfrequently can lead to end products being held in storage for a significant \\namount of time pre-despatch to the customer. During this holding time \\nmost products organoleptic performance will typically be deteriorating. \\nThis is especially so if the product bears a \\u2018use-by\\u2019 code rather than a \\u2018best \\nbefore\\u2019 code (e.g. usually chilled products).\\nMost chilled foods will deteriorate during storage due to a combination \\nof microbiological, physical and chemical factors. Frozen foods may deterio-\\nrate due to ice crystal formation and aspects such as oxidative reactions and \\nfreezer burn. Ambient products could be susceptible to the absorbance of \\nmoisture from the environment over time (especially if not packaged in \\nrobust gas and moisture barrier packaging materials). External factors can \\nincrease the potential for such deterioration to occur, including higher than \\nideal chill store/frozen store temperatures.\\nAs a result of the potential for product deterioration during storage \\nsome businesses choose to conduct a sensory evaluation of the stored (stock \\nholding) batches on a routine basis and at a frequency which reflects the \\npotential for deterioration to occur. Such checks are important as it is better \\nto be aware of the deterioration of a product batch early in order that a \\nfresh batch run can be planned in time, rather than awaiting receipt of a \\ncustomer order, only to then find during final quality checks at point of \\ndespatch that the product does not meet the quality criteria required due \\nto deterioration which has occurred during storage.\\n11.4.17 Despatch\\nSome food companies tend to focus their taste panels on the final product \\njust before despatch to the customer. At this stage there is little that can be \\ndone to rectify any product problems which may have occurred earlier in \\nthe production process; however, such checks serve as a useful quality \\ncontrol check point and provide the major control of avoiding any sub-\\nstandard products from being despatched to the end customer.\\nFor these reasons the final assessment of product organoleptic perfor-\\nmance (compared against the requirements defined in the agreed customer \\nKIL11.indd   231 3/12/2010   7:55:52 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n232 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nspecification) is typically seen as the final \\u2018quality safety-net\\u2019 prior to \\ndespatch.\\n11.5 Sensory quality assurance (QA) after product despatch\\n11.5.1 Distribution depot and in-store inspection\\nSensory checks upon the product are likely to continue even after it has \\nbeen despatched, usually in the form of \\u2018depot checks\\u2019 (typically conducted \\nupon delivery as part of the customer acceptance checks) or in-store/stock \\ninspections conducted by the customer. By having a clearly defined and \\nagreed sensory description/specification for each food product, quality \\nqueries and problems at depot and in-store can be reduced. Without agreed \\nproduct standards the manufacturer risks the potential for their foods to \\nbe judged and possibly rejected purely on subjective assessments.\\n11.5.2 End-of-life assessment/review\\nOn a routine basis many businesses review the organoleptic performance \\nof their products at the very end of the product shelf-life as part of their \\nQA program. These tests can involve comparison against newer stock of \\nthe products and focus upon comparison against the agreed/specified \\nsensory profile (which should define the target and limits of acceptability \\nupon aspects including product appearance, aroma, taste and texture). Typi-\\ncally such assessments will involve the use of a multidisciplinary panel \\nincluding members of the quality, NPD, process development, production \\nand sales teams.\\nTo best reflect the actual conditions that the product batches will encoun-\\nter during distribution and consumer storage, businesses should seek to \\nhold their end-of-life samples in temperature conditions which reflect the \\nend customer shelf-life testing criteria, and this is most easily achieved \\nthrough the use of storage incubators. However, many businesses choose to \\nsimplify this approach by purchasing samples of their products from the \\nrelevant retail/food service outlets, storing them in domestic fridges (set to \\ntemperatures recognised by industry research to reflect typical consumer \\nfridge conditions) for the remaining days of their shelf-life, followed by \\ntaste panel evaluation on the last day of the shelf-life to confirm that the \\norganoleptic shelf-life appears to be set correctly (i.e. the product quality \\nhas not yet deteriorated to a point of being unacceptable to the end \\nconsumer).\\nAs with the routine daily site taste panels the businesses may choose \\nto score the attendee\\u2019s assessment of each \\u2018end-of-life\\u2019 sample whereas \\nothers choose a simple \\u2018pass/fail\\u2019 approach. The results can then be trend \\nanalysed over time and reacted to in the event of a problem issue being \\nnoted.\\nKIL11.indd   232 3/12/2010   7:55:52 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 233\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\n11.5.3 Conflicts of interest\\nWhilst organoleptic performance is very important to the commercial \\nsuccess of the product, the vital issue of ensuring product safety can some-\\ntimes lead to compromises being necessary with regard to the achievement \\nof an optimum organoleptic quality. For example many food products \\nrequire cooking for a \\u2018longer than organoleptically ideal\\u2019 length of time to \\nachieve the required levels of microbiological reduction, thereby achieving \\nproduct safety and shelf-life, and in doing so the process may adversely \\naffect the texture, consistency or colour of the product.\\nAnother example is that product acidification to help achieve microbio-\\nlogical control and increased shelf-life can consequently impact upon the \\nflavour profile of the product and make product consistency (e.g. some \\nsoup/sauce starch suspensions) more prone to deterioration. As the cus-\\ntomer and business consequences of a food safety issue can be catastrophic, \\nit is vitally important that all departments work to the same site priorities, \\nalways ensuring product safety first whilst striving to attain the required \\nproduct quality/consistency.\\n11.6 Conclusions\\nAs can be seen by the numerous examples given in this chapter, the manu-\\nfacture of multicomponent food products such as soups, sauces and ready \\nmeals presents a wide range of potential for faults to occur with regard to \\nthe quality of the products being manufactured. It may be useful for the \\nreader to reflect upon the use of sensory evaluation as a tool in assuring \\nquality at each stage of the food production process. Such sensory evalua-\\ntion in support of quality assurance could be categorised in distinct phases \\nwhich include:\\n\\u2022 avoid: sensory techniques to help avoid product faults (e.g. checks to \\nconfirm the correctness of incoming ingredients);\\n\\u2022 detect: sensory techniques designed to detect product faults (e.g. checks \\nupon the organoleptic quality correctness of intermediary and end \\nproduct recipes);\\n\\u2022 decide: sensory techniques to help decision make and resolve issues (e.g. \\nsensory assessments and panels can be utilised to help decide whether \\na product quality fault contravenes the product specification and/or \\nrenders the product unacceptable to the end consumer. Sensory panels \\ncan also help a business decide whether the reprocessing/reworking of \\nexcess or sub-standard product batches is a possible salvage/cost saving \\noption, or whether such actions will merely result in creating further \\nnon-saleable stock).\\nThe key themes of benefit to businesses seeking to develop sensory \\ncontrol include:\\nKIL11.indd   233 3/12/2010   7:55:52 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n234 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\n\\u2022 focus upon ensuring the correct and consistent quality of all ingredient \\nsupplies;\\n\\u2022 ensure that all manufacturing processes are well maintained, robust and \\nconsistent;\\n\\u2022 continually seek to make sensory checks objective rather than subjective \\nwherever possible;\\n\\u2022 always ensure that the sensory criteria required of the product are \\nrealistic and consistently achievable before being formally agreed/ \\ncommitted to with the end customer;\\n\\u2022 ensure that the product sensory criteria are clearly defined within the \\nagreed customer product specification, together with all acceptable tol-\\nerance limits;\\n\\u2022 constantly monitor (via supervisory checks and audits) that the required \\nsensory standard checks are diligently and consistently applied at each \\nkey stage of the manufacturing process.\\nThe application of sensory-related quality assurance techniques within the \\nready meal, soup and sauce sectors can be viewed as a vast and complex \\narea, yet the reader should be assured that the majority of the systems and \\nchecks applied are low cost, relatively straightforward in their design and \\napplication, and are best administered by trained staff who have sound \\nexperience of the products and good clear knowledge of the customer \\nexpectations.\\n11.7 Acknowledgements\\nBOSTWICK CONSISTOMETERS.

This report\\nis structured to guide investors through the key water risks facing these industries and features a\\nunique dataset ranking 37 major food companies on the quality of their corporate water management.\\nBecause the attributes of water are both industry- and location-specific, any risk analysis must take\\ninto account how much water a given company uses and pollutes, as well as the security of the\\nlocal water resources on which a company relies. Given the significant amount of water use and\\npollution associated with agricultural production, supply chain water risk can be as financially\\nmaterial as water risks facing a food company\\u2019s owned operations. Overall, corporate water risk\\nexposure can be thought of as a function of three variables (Exhibit 1):\\n1. Water dependence: The relative amount of water needed for a company\\u2019s direct operations\\nor supply chain, as well as the volumes and intensity of associated wastewater that must be\\nassimilated by a receiving body of water.\\n2. Water security: The degree to which conditions in specific operating or supply chain\\ngeographies\\u2014and related physical, regulatory and reputational risks\\u2014threaten the underlying\\nsecurity of a company\\u2019s access to water and ability to discharge wastewater. Water security can\\nbe undermined by a company\\u2019s own impacts, or by cumulative impacts from others within or\\nacross sectors. It can weaken a company\\u2019s ability to operate profitably, especially when\\ncombined with high corporate water dependence.\\n3. Strength of corporate management response: Companies have a host of options available to\\nmitigate water risks\\u2014ranging from operational water efficiency improvements to setting water\\nefficiency expectations for suppliers to undertaking watershed-level actions that help support\\noverall improvements in water resource sustainability.\\nExhibit 1: Key Elements of Corporate Water Risk: Water Dependence, Water Security & Response\\nCorporate Water Risk Dashboard\\nChapter Guide\\nChapter 1, \\u201cWater Risks Facing the Food Sector,\\u201d provides investors an overview of the relative\\nwater dependence of companies in the packaged food, beverage, meat and agricultural products\\nindustries. This chapter outlines the key risk drivers that threaten water security for the sector, and\\nrecommends a set of indicators that can be used to evaluate company risk exposure. \\nChapter 2, \\u201cA Primer on Analyzing Agricultural Water Risk,\\u201d lays out a framework for evaluating\\nwater risks specific to the agricultural supply chain. The framework takes into account crop-specific\\nand region-specific water impacts and risks, the nature of a company\\u2019s sourcing model, and relevant\\ntactics for mitigating agricultural water risks, from corporate procurement policies down to specific\\nfarming practices. \\nChapter 3, \\u201cBenchmark Results: Key Findings,\\u201d provides data on the corporate water risk\\nmanagement performance of 37 companies in the packaged food, beverage, meat and agricultural\\nproducts industries. The companies evaluated are largely public, U.S.-headquartered firms listed\\non the S&P 500 and Russell 1000 indices.\\nChapter 4, \\u201cBenchmark Results: Findings by Water Management Category,\\u201d provides a more \\nin-depth discussion of the benchmarking results within each water management category and\\nincludes examples of leading corporate practices.\\nChapter 5, \\u201cRecommendations for Companies and Investors,\\u201d provides investors and food sector\\ncompanies with recommendations for improving water risk analysis and management.\\nAppendix A details the company benchmarking methodology and Appendix B provides \\ncompany-specific scores for each indicator evaluated. Appendix B is also available online \\nas a downloadable spreadsheet at: www.ceres.org/foodwaterrisk.\\nAppendix C provides data on the relative water risks of the top agricultural commodities purchased\\nby companies in this report and Appendix D provides a list of third-party databases and resources\\nrelevant to water issues in the food sector.\\nFor further guidance on corporate water risk analysis, see Ceres\\u2019 Investor Handbook for Water\\nRisk Integration, available at www.ceres.org/investorwaterhandbook \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks How to Use This Report6\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Executive Summary 7\\nExecutive Summary\\nThe global food sector faces extraordinary risks from the twin challenges of water scarcity \\nand water pollution. Growing competition for water, combined with weak regulations, failing\\ninfrastructure, pollution and climate change impacts threaten the sector\\u2019s water security and\\ncontribute to a water availability emergency that was recently ranked the world\\u2019s \\u201ctop global risk\\u201d \\nby the World Economic Forum.1\\nThis report examines how water risks affect the profitability and competitive positioning of 37\\nmajor food sector companies in four industries: packaged food, beverage, meat and agricultural\\nproducts. It evaluates and ranks these companies\\u2014the majority of which are U.S. domiciled and\\npublicly-traded\\u2014on how well they are positioned to anticipate and mitigate these risks, as well as\\ncontribute to improved water resource management. \\nThe report provides recommendations for how analysts and investors can effectively evaluate \\nfood sector companies on their water risk exposure and management practices. It also provides\\nrecommendations for how food companies can improve water efficiency and water quality across\\ntheir operations and supply chains to reduce risks and protect water resources. \\nWater Risks Facing the Food Sector\\nFrom farm to factory, producing food is the most water-intensive business on earth. Abundant\\nclean water is essential to food processing\\u2014as an ingredient, for cleaning and moving raw materials,\\nand as the principal agent used in sanitizing plant machinery. However, the vast majority of the\\nfood sector\\u2019s water use and water pollution footprint is associated with the agricultural supply \\nchain. Seventy percent of the world\\u2019s freshwater is used to irrigate crops and raise animals. Currently,\\none-third of total food production is in areas of high or extremely high water stress, or competition.2\\nThe run-off of fertilizers from farm fields is one of the most common causes of water pollution worldwide,\\ncausing dead zones, harming fisheries, affecting human health and raising water treatment costs.\\nThis report identifies five important water risk drivers that affect the water security of the food\\nsector: 1) growing competition for water, 2) weak regulation, 3) aging and inadequate water\\ninfrastructure, 4) water pollution and 5) climate change. These water risks are already affecting\\ncorporate income statements and balance sheets due to: disrupted operations and limits on growth\\ndriven by water shortages and loss of social license to operate; increased operating costs due to\\nabrupt water rate hikes and stricter regulations; and reduced margins due to higher commodity\\ncosts linked to decreases in agricultural productivity (Exhibit ES.1). \\nMany food sector companies are acknowledging these risks: 82 percent of food sector respondents\\nto the CDP\\u2019s 2014 water information request indicate that water risks could have a substantive\\nimpact on business operations and 90 percent of the 31 publicly-traded U.S. companies evaluated \\nin this report cite water as a material risk in their 10-K financial filings. \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Executive Summary8\\nRecent examples of financial impacts include:\\n\\u25cf Cargill reported a 12 percent drop in 2014 fourth-quarter profits as a four-year drought \\nin the U.S. Southwest damaged pastures used to raise beef.3\\n\\u25cf The Campbell Soup Company saw a 28 percent drop in its California-based carrot division\\nprofits in early 2015 due in part to drought followed by intense rains.4\\n\\u25cf The Coca-Cola Company decided not to move forward on the development of an $81 million\\nbottling plant in southern India in April 2015 due to resistance from local farmers who cited\\nconcerns about strains on local groundwater supplies.5\\n\\u25cf GrainCorp, Australia\\u2019s largest agribusiness, reported a 64 percent drop in 2014 profits due \\nto a prolonged drought that cut grain deliveries by 23 percent and nearly halved grain exports.6\\n\\u25cf J.M. Smucker introduced an eight percent price increase on Folger\\u2019s K-Cup coffee packs \\nin early 2015 to offset the worst drought in Brazil in decades.7\\n\\u25cf Unilever estimated that natural disasters linked to a changing climate\\u2014in particular, food price\\nincreases, water scarcity and reduced productivity in many parts of the agricultural supply\\nchain\\u2014cost the company around $400 million annually.8\\nExhibit ES.1: Business & Financial Impacts of Key Water Risk Drivers \\n\\u2022 Revenue & Growth\\n\\u2022 Operating Costs\\n\\u2022 Capital Expenditures\\n\\u2022 Cost of Goods Sold\\n\\u2022 Asset Risk\\n\\u02dd\\nCompetition \\nfor Water\\nW\\u02ddeak\\nRegulation\\n\\u02dd\\nWater pollutionA\\u02ddging /\\nInadequate\\nInfrastructure\\n\\u02dd\\nClimate Change \\n& Weather\\nvariability\\n1 2 3 4 5\\nAbrupt Rate Hikes for\\nWater & Wastewater\\nTreatment\\nReputational\\ndamage/Loss of Social\\nLicense to Operate\\nWater Supply &\\nTreatment Failures\\nRationing \\n& Shortages\\ndecrease in\\nAgricultural\\nproductivity\\nStricter \\nRegulations\\n5 Key Water Risk Drivers\\nBusiness Impacts\\nIncome Statement & Balance Sheet\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Executive Summary 9\\nBenchmark Results \\nThe report analyzes food sector companies against actions taken in four categories of water \\nrisk management, using indicators and scoring drawn largely from the Ceres Aqua Gauge:9\\n1) overall corporate governance and management of water risk; and actions to reduce water risks \\nand impacts in their 2) direct operations, 3) manufacturing supply chain, and 4) agricultural supply\\nchain.

Agricultural products and meat companies had\\nmedian scores of 13.5 and 10.5, respectively. \\nCorporate Governance & Management \\nAlthough water risk was identified as a corporate governance priority by many of the companies,\\nboard oversight of water did not consistently translate into strong absolute performance. Of the\\n16 companies with board oversight of water risk, most performed relatively poorly, with more than\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Executive Summary10\\n60 percent receiving fewer than 35 total points. In addition, for nearly half (19) of the companies\\nevaluated, management-level oversight for water was relegated to executives at least two levels\\nbelow the CEO. Most CEOs are not directly incentivized to address water risk: Campbell Soup,\\nDean Foods, Molson Coors and Unilever are the only companies that offer explicit financial\\nincentives to the CEO and executive officers for water-related performance. \\nOnly 30 percent (11) of companies indicated that water risks were considered as part of major\\nbusiness planning activities and investment decision-making. Although water is notoriously\\nunderpriced in most markets, Nestl\\u00e9 and Unilever are the only companies in this assessment that\\ndisclose using a \\u201ctrue cost\\u201d or shadow price for water to analyze the return on investment of water-\\nefficiency investments. \\ndirect Operations\\nA majority of companies (23) have begun to evaluate water risks in their direct operations, but\\ntwo-thirds (22) are still not evaluating water issues in their agricultural supply chains. Basic water\\naccounting data on direct operations performance is common, with 70 percent (26) of companies\\ndisclosing basic data on water use. In addition, 70 percent (26) have targets to reduce water use in\\ntheir direct operations, although the aggressiveness of these targets varies. \\nWater quality issues get less priority. Most companies assessed do not disclose the percentage \\nof their facilities that are in compliance with local wastewater discharge regulations. Only two\\ncompanies\\u2014Coca-Cola and Nestl\\u00e9\\u2014reported goals to reduce wastewater discharges and improve\\nwater quality beyond compliance requirements. \\nMost companies are limiting their investments in water risk mitigation to improving facility-level\\nwater use efficiencies. Because many water risks stem from the impacts of other water users \\nand poor regulations, such a narrow operational focus may overlook lower-cost, higher impact\\nopportunities to help address critical watershed-level challenges. Only four companies\\u2014Coca-Cola,\\nGeneral Mills, Molson Coors and PepsiCo\\u2014have developed collaborative watershed protection\\nplans that are linked to regions of high water risk. \\nManufacturing Supply Chains\\nNearly one-quarter of companies (9) ask their manufacturing suppliers to report on water use,\\nwastewater discharge and management practices. General Mills and Campbell Soup ask suppliers\\nto complete supplier scorecards that include water use sections. Only five companies require their\\nmanufacturing suppliers to establish their own water management programs. \\nAgricultural Supply Chains\\nOnly six companies have sustainable agriculture policies that address water, with PepsiCo\\u2019s\\nand Unilever\\u2019s being the most robust. Unilever has an Agricultural Code of Conduct that includes\\nan entire section focused on water use and pollution and defines practices with which agricultural\\nproducers are expected to comply. \\nDespite the lack of policies, 41 percent (15) of companies have set time-bound goals to source\\nagricultural commodities more sustainably. For many companies, these commitments were\\nlimited to just one or two commodities. Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kellogg, and Unilever have \\nall set time-bound goals to source the majority of their agricultural inputs from farmers using\\nsustainable water management practices.\\nForty-three percent (16) of companies gather data from agricultural producers on the water\\nimpacts of their farming practices. For most companies, the data collected is often from a very\\nnarrow subset of their overall production base, and in many cases it is unclear how this data \\nis being used to inform sourcing decisions or to help farmers improve their practices.\\nRecommendations for Companies & Investors\\nCompany Recommendations  \\n1. Increase board oversight and understanding of material water risks. Corporate board members\\nhave a fiduciary duty for risk management oversight. While 43 percent (19) of the companies\\nevaluated in this report have board committees charged with environmental oversight, this oversight\\ndid not consistently translate into strong water management performance. Board charters should\\nbe strengthened to explicitly mention water. Additionally, board members should be regularly\\nbriefed by management on water-related risks, and provided with opportunities to engage with\\nexternal water experts.\\n2. Conduct robust water risk analysis. Many of the companies assessed in this report have relatively\\nweak systems\\u2014if any at all\\u2014for collecting and interpreting data on the severity of their exposure\\nto water risks. Companies should accelerate risk assessments, including analysis of their\\nmanufacturing and agricultural supply chains. When conducting water risk analysis, companies\\nshould bear in mind the various kinds of water risks to which they may be exposed (e.g. physical\\nscarcity risks and quality risks, regulatory risks, social license to operate risks), use forward-\\nlooking models or scenarios to identify the likelihood and severity of future risks, and use robust\\ndatasets to support this analysis (see Appendix D).\\n3. Address watershed-level risks. Most food sector companies are limiting their investments \\nin water risk mitigation to improving facility- or field-level water use efficiencies and meeting\\nregulatory compliance standards. While these efforts are critically important, even achieving\\nbest-in-class water use efficiency may not be sufficient to mitigate the physical, regulatory \\nor reputational risks resulting from the broader mismanagement of local water resources. \\nA narrow operational focus may also overlook lower-cost, higher-return opportunities to work\\ncollaboratively to reduce risks through activities that protect and restore watersheds. Companies\\nshould develop water risk mitigation plans that incorporate targeted investments to improve the\\nconditions of the most at-risk watersheds on which their facilities and supply chains depend.\\nCompanies should also consider opportunities to align public policy positions and lobbying\\nactivities in ways that encourage government officials to implement more sustainable water\\nmanagement policies.\\n4. Tackle water risks and impacts in agricultural supply chains. As water supplies are increasingly\\ndepleted and polluted in major agricultural regions across the world, traditional risk management\\napproaches such as hedging and geographic diversification are becoming less effective.\\nCompanies can achieve more by engaging directly with their supply chain to strengthen farmer\\npractices and protect watersheds. Key strategies include setting sustainable agriculture policies\\nand time-bound sourcing goals, purchasing certified sustainable commodities where relevant,\\nand collecting data from farmers on their practices while providing assistance and incentives \\nfor improvement.\\n5. Improve disclosure. Companies need to disclose to investors their exposure to water risk, as well as\\nstrategies and progress made in mitigating such risks. As much as possible, data should be reported\\nat the facility or regional level. Companies publicly-listed in the United States are required by the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to disclose to shareholders financially material risks\\nrelated to climate change and water in their operations and supply chains.10 Additionally, investors\\nexpect companies to provide more detailed disclosure of risks and mitigation strategies through\\ntheir corporate sustainability reports and in responses to CDP\\u2019s annual water information request.  \\nInvestor Recommendations\\n1. Analyze corporate water risk in terms of water dependence, security and response. When\\nevaluating a company\\u2019s overall risk, use the information and data resources suggested in this\\nreport to capture corporate water dependence (the amount of water needed for a company\\u2019s\\ndirect operations and supply chain, as well as the volumes and intensity of associated wastewater\\nthat must be assimilated by a receiving water body); the security of the water resources they \\nrely on; and the quality of management response to those risks.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Executive Summary 11\\n2. Go beyond direct operations to consider supply chain water risks. While most companies \\nin the food sector are not directly involved in agricultural production, many are significantly\\nexposed to agricultural water risks through their suppliers. When analyzing water risks\\nembedded in agricultural supply chains, consider that risk exposure is shaped by several\\nfactors, including the primary agricultural commodities the company buys, the level of water\\ndependence and security associated with those commodities, as well as the sourcing model\\nused by the company to procure agricultural inputs.  \\n3. Engage underperforming companies. Investors should engage portfolio companies on how they\\nmanage water risks. As a result of poor disclosure by many companies in the sector, investors\\nneed to engage directly with corporate management to gather relevant information and encourage\\nfuture disclosure. In addition to direct engagement, consider leveraging existing collaborative\\ninvestor efforts that engage companies on water, such as Ceres\\u2019 Investor Network, the United\\nNations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment\\u2019s (UNPRI) \\u201cWater Risks in Agricultural\\nSupply Chains\\u201d group, and the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility\\u2019s (ICCR) Water &\\nFood group.11\\n4. Integrate information from water risk analysis and corporate engagement into buy/sell\\ndecisions and beyond. Taking into account unique investor objectives, possible approaches\\ninclude embedding water analysis into overall environmental, social and governance scores;\\naltering the size of the investment universe to either avoid high water risk industries or companies,\\nor include companies with a strong management response; and embedding water risk analysis\\nin scenario analysis in financial models. Investors can conduct portfolio-level analysis of exposure to\\nhigh water risk regions, companies or agricultural activities. It is also beneficial to analyze cross-\\nasset class exposure, from equities and fixed income to commodities and farmland funds. For\\nother approaches and more details, see Ceres\\u2019 Investor Handbook for Water Risk Integration.12\\n5. Support efforts to increase and standardize food sector reporting on water. While some food\\nsector companies had robust disclosure, most did not, with some companies failing to report\\nbasic information on their water use and only 43 percent providing data to CDP\\u2019s 2014 water\\ninformation request. Investors should encourage company reporting to CDP, and also support\\nimprovements to the survey to ensure that more comparable, industry-relevant data is requested\\nfrom food sector companies. Investors may also wish to engage the Sustainability Accounting\\nStandards Board (SASB) on food sector water metrics.13\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Executive Summary12\\nWater & the Food Sector\\nClean water is already in short supply. The amount of water on the planet is for all practical purposes\\nfixed. Only 2.5 percent of the world\\u2019s water is freshwater. With 68 percent of that total locked up in\\nglaciers, humans rely on the remaining 30 percent found in surface and groundwater.1 However,\\nmuch of this freshwater is polluted and water quality is deteriorating in many parts of the world.2\\nConstrained water supplies face growing demand. The trends of population growth, urban migration,\\nrising incomes and climate change are slated to lead to a 50 percent increase in water withdrawals\\nin developing countries and an 18 percent increase in developed countries by 2025.3 By that time,\\ntwo-thirds of the world\\u2019s population will be living in areas of high water competition or \\u201cwater stress,\\u201d5\\nand subject to periodic shortages of water.4 Meanwhile, at least 20 percent of the water used to\\nirrigate crops (equivalent to roughly eight percent of total global food production) is non-renewable,\\ncoming from groundwater basins that are being rapidly depleted.6\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 1 13\\nWater Risks Facing the Food Sector\\nChapter Overview\\n\\u25cf The global food sector faces extraordinary risks from the twin challenges of water scarcity \\nand water pollution.

Eighty-two percent of food sector\\nrespondents to the 2014 CDP water information request indicate that water risks could have\\na substantive impact on business operations. Of the 31 publicly-traded U.S. companies\\nevaluated in this report, 90 percent cite water as a risk in their 10-K filings.\\n\\u25cf Investors will need to elevate their attention to the materiality of food sector exposure to water\\nissues, integrating individual company\\u2019s water dependence, security and water management\\nresponse into company risk analysis and valuation.\\nCHApTER 1\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 114\\nIndustry description Companies Analyzed\\nAverage\\nOperational \\nWater Intensity\\n(gal./$1 revenue)*\\nMedian \\nWater Risk\\nManagement\\nScore (0-100)\\nAgricultural products Companies that produce and process foods,\\nbut do not package and market them, as\\nwell as companies that grow crops or are\\nowners of plantations (includes constituents\\nof GICS 302020, Food Products, Agricultural\\nProducts).

From the field to the factory, producing food\\nis the most water-intensive business on earth. The majority of the food sector\\u2019s water use and water\\npollution footprint is associated with the agricultural supply chain. Irrigating crops and raising\\nanimals consumes roughly 70 percent of the world\\u2019s freshwater.7 For instance, beef uses more\\nwater than anything else humans eat. Raising a kilogram of beef requires 15,415 liters of water\\n(primarily to grow the feed for the animals). A kilo of pasta requires 1,850 liters of water, most \\nof it for growing the wheat.8 In addition, many agricultural practices contribute to water pollution. \\nIn China, a 2010 government study found that the manure and chemical fertilizer run-off from\\nfarms causes more pollution nationwide than industry.9, 10\\nAbundant clean water is also essential to food processing\\u2014as an ingredient, an initial and\\nintermediate cleaning source, an efficient conveyor of raw materials, and the principal agent used\\nin sanitizing plant machinery (Exhibit 1.1). Some food processing activities, particularly in the\\nmeat sector, are also associated with high levels of contaminated wastewater discharge that must\\nbe treated before being returned to the water supply. \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 1 15\\nExhibit 1.1: Water Dependence: Key Water Use & Pollution Issues in the Food Sector\\nAgricultural producers\\n(Farmers, ranchers, dairies, etc.)\\nAgricultural products\\nIndustry\\nBeverage \\nIndustry\\nMeat processors \\nIndustry\\npackaged Food \\nIndustry\\nUSES OF FRESH WATER\\n\\u2022 Crop irrigation\\n\\u2022 Drinking & cooling\\nwater for livestock\\n\\u2022 Cleaning & disinfecting\\n\\u2022 Air conditioning of\\nlivestock facilities\\n\\u2022 Product washing \\n& moving\\n\\u2022 Cooling water\\n\\u2022 Boiler water\\n\\u2022 Air conditioning\\n\\u2022 Freshwater as \\nan ingredient \\n\\u2022 Product washing \\n& moving\\n\\u2022 Cooling water\\n\\u2022 Boiler water\\n\\u2022 Cleaning & disinfecting\\n\\u2022 Air conditioning\\n\\u2022 Drinking & cooling \\nwater for livestock\\n\\u2022 Cleaning & disinfection\\n\\u2022 Boiler water\\n\\u2022 Cleaning processing\\nequipment\\n\\u2022 Air conditioning\\n\\u2022 Freshwater as \\nan ingredient \\n\\u2022 Product washing \\n& moving\\n\\u2022 Cooling water\\n\\u2022 Boiler water\\n\\u2022 Cleaning & disinfection\\n\\u2022 Air conditioning\\npOTEnTIAL SOURCES OF WASTEWATER / pOLLUTIOn\\n\\u2022 Run-off of water from\\nfarm fields that is\\npolluted with fertilizer,\\npesticides & herbicides\\n\\u2022 Animal manure\\nmanagement/lagoons\\n\\u2022 Pathogenic organisms\\nfrom livestock spread\\ndiseases \\n\\u2022 Run-off of water from\\nfarm fields that is\\npolluted with fertilizer,\\npesticides & herbicides\\n\\u2022 Wastewater from\\nprocessing is high \\nin suspended solids,\\norganic sugars,\\nstarches & residual\\npesticides\\n\\u2022 Fermentation processes\\nproduce wastewater\\nthat is high in\\nbiochemical oxygen\\ndemand\\n\\u2022 Animal manure, which\\ncan sometimes contain\\nantibiotics and arsenic\\n\\u2022 Blood by-products\\nwhich are high in\\nbiochemical oxygen\\ndemand (an indicator\\nof the level of organic\\nmatter in wastewater)\\n\\u2022 Wastewater discharge\\ncontaining high levels of\\nnitrogen & phosphorus\\n\\u2022 Pathogenic organisms\\nin wastewater \\n\\u2022 Chlorine residue from\\ndisinfecting pathogenic\\norganisms\\n\\u2022 Biochemical oxygen\\ndemand (an indicator\\nof the level of organic\\nmatter in wastewater),\\ntotal suspended solids,\\nresidual chlorine \\n& pesticides\\ndirect OperationsFood Sector Supply Chain\\nSource: United National Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Pollution from food processing factories and environmental protection,\\nhttp://www.unido.org/fileadmin/import/32129_25PollutionfromFoodProcessing.7.pdf\\nThe majority of the food sector\\u2019s water use and water pollution footprint is associated with the activities of the agricultural supply chain\\u2014namely\\nirrigation and agricultural run-off.

COMPETITION FOR WATER \\nCompetition for water within and between different sectors is on the rise in many regions of the\\nglobe. As the world\\u2019s population increases by nearly three billion by 205018 and more people \\neat resource-intensive foods such as meat, food production could rise by 70 percent, pushing\\nup agricultural water consumption by 20 percent.19, 20 Agricultural water users are already coming\\ninto more frequent conflict with urban water demands, as is well illustrated by the current debate\\nabout the legitimacy of agricultural versus urban water needs in drought-stricken California.21\\nBusiness Impacts: \\n\\uf0da Rationing and abrupt rate hikes. Increased competition puts a premium on supply, leading \\nin some cases to rationing or reduced allocations\\u2014or steep water rate increases. In areas of\\nMexico, water demand is far outstripping groundwater supplies, leading to significant price hikes\\nfor industrial users as well as new usage limits.22 In 2013, water price increases in Mexico were as\\nhigh as 300 percent and new regulations and fees for allotted water volumes at food manufacturing\\nplants, including those of Kellogg, led to higher operating costs.23 In Kenya, alcoholic beverage-maker\\nDiageo anticipates its operations will face growth restrictions in the next five years as a growing\\npopulation outpaces water supplies.24\\nRelevant Financial Indicators\\nIncreased operating costs due to higher water rates or costs of acquiring \\nalternative water sources\\nRevenues and projected revenues affected due to production interruptions \\nor constraints on growth\\nHigher cost of goods sold due to water constraints on agricultural production\\n\\uf0da Increased conflict with other water users & loss of social license to operate. Water shortages\\namplify reputational issues for companies who are seen as competing with local communities for\\naccess to water supplies. This can lead to the loss of a company\\u2019s social license to operate, business\\ndisruption and brand damage. The Coca-Cola Company decided not to move forward on the\\ndevelopment of an $81 million bottling plant in southern India in April 2015 due to resistance from\\nlocal farmers who cited concerns about strains on local groundwater supplies.25 Even in water-rich\\nregions, companies perceived as using water unfairly may be exposed to reputational risk or loss of\\ncommunity support.26\\nRelevant Financial Indicators\\nRevenues or projected revenues affected due to production interruptions \\nor constraints on growth\\n2. WEAK REGUlATION \\nMany local and national governments and ministries lack the policy frameworks, institutional\\ncapacity and political will to manage competing water demands, maintain acceptable water\\nquality and enforce permits. Most governments around the world have historically chosen \\nto charge less than the full cost for water service for a variety of reasons, typically leading \\nto inefficient water use by both urban and agricultural users, despite scarcity. In many regions,\\nwater permits are free, and sometimes\\u2014particularly in the case of groundwater use\\u2014completely\\nunregulated. In many markets, governments also tend to administer water sector activities\\nseparately, leaving urban, agricultural and industrial water use poorly measured and coordinated. \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 1 17\\nBusiness impacts: \\n\\uf0da Shortages, rationing or reallocation of water permits. Inappropriate water permit allocation \\nand a lack of effective pricing, water markets, or incentives to moderate demand increase the\\nlikelihood of shortages. In India, the world\\u2019s biggest user of groundwater in the world, the water\\ntable is falling precipitously in many areas because of a lack of regulation of well-drilling and the\\nadoption of motorized pumps, which run on subsidized energy and number 27 million, up from\\ntens of thousands in the 1960s.27, 28 Nestl\\u00e9 reports that in 2013 the company temporarily reduced\\nwater consumption or halted operations at facilities in both India and Ghana due to shortages. \\nRelevant financial indicators\\nRevenues and projected revenues affected due to production interruptions \\nor constraints on growth \\nHigher operating costs if alternative water sources must be found\\nHigher cost of goods sold due to water constraints on agricultural production\\n\\uf0da Abrupt rate hikes for water and wastewater treatment. Delays in introducing effective water\\npricing or water allocation management systems increase the likelihood of steep or abrupt water\\nand wastewater rates hikes for industry, especially when drought or shortages increase political\\npressure on regulators to take action. In many regions, there is a negative correlation between \\nthe cost of water and its relative scarcity (Exhibit 1.4). If introduced quickly, water rate hikes \\nhave the potential to significantly affect the market capitalization of companies. A recent analysis\\nshowed that an increase in industrial water rates across Brazil to a level equivalent to the highest\\nrates already charged in some regions of the country could decrease the market cap of the\\nBrazilian packaged food sector by more than five percent.29\\nThe rate of water price increases is accelerating in many parts of the world. Between 2011 and 2014,\\nwater and wastewater prices in the BRIC countries jumped 22 percent and 25.9 percent, respectively,\\nwhile U.S. water and wastewater prices grew by 17.6 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively.30 China \\nis expected in the next three years to increase water tariffs by 30 percent nationally.31\\nRelevant financial indicators\\nHigher operating costs due to increased water rates\\nIncreased capital expenditures in technologies that reduce water \\nand wastewater intensity of operations\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 118\\nExhibit 1.4: Global Water Prices Relative to Water Stress ($/m3)\\n\\u0003 Low price High price \\u0002\\n\\u0000\\nHigh Stress\\nLow Stress\\n\\u0001\\n\\u0006 Countries\\nSources: 2014 GWI Water Tariff Survey, Global Water Intelligence, http://www.globalwaterintel.com/tariff-survey/\\n& 2013 Aqueduct Data, World Resources Institute, http://www.wri.org/resources/data-sets/aqueduct-country-and-river-basin-rankings\\nIn many countries facing high water stress, water prices are subsidized and fail to reflect the scarcity value of water.\\n\\u00d8\\n$2\\n\\u00d8\\n$4\\n\\u00d8\\n$6\\n\\u00d8\\n$8\\n\\u00d8\\n$10\\n5 -\\n4 -\\n3 -\\n2 -\\n1 -\\n0 - \\u00d8\\n$0\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 1 19\\n3. AGING OR INADEqUATE INFRASTRUCTURE & ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER \\nDeveloped and developing countries share a common problem of water infrastructure systems\\nbeing substantially under-funded. In developed countries, massive investment is needed to\\nrepair deteriorating, aging systems. A 2012 study by the American Water Works Association (AWWA)\\nestimates that the U.S. needs to spend $1 trillion over the next 25 years on the most urgent\\ninvestments.32 The developing world, even within BRIC countries, is marked by a lack of\\nconsistent access to potable water and sanitation for millions of households. \\nBusiness Impacts:\\n\\uf0da Risk of water supply and treatment failures. Lack of reinvestment in aging infrastructure \\nby water and wastewater utilities increases the risk of failures (water mains breaking, treatment\\nfailures) that could impact business or bring production to a halt. As a result, companies may have\\nto invest more in their own supplies and treatment to ensure supply reliability and quality. In the\\nU.S., where most systems are over 50 years old, 240,000 water mains break annually.33 Mexico\\ncurrently treats only 48 percent of its municipal wastewater.34 Faced with declining water quality\\nfrom municipal sources, Nestl\\u00e9 installed sophisticated technology in its Lagos de Moreno, Mexico\\nice cream plant that extracts excess water from incoming milk, and then recycles it, dramatically\\ncutting water use.35, 36\\nRelevant financial indicators\\nRevenues and projected revenues affected due to production interruptions \\nor inability to expand existing operations\\nIncreased capital expenditures in water storage, wastewater treatment \\nand recycling technologies\\n\\uf0da Harm to corporate-community relations. Inadequate delivery of water and sanitation by\\ngovernment to local communities enhances perceptions of inequity of access and harms corporate-\\ncommunity relationships, potentially restricting a company\\u2019s ability to operate or grow. This is\\nbecoming a bigger issue as access to water becomes more widely recognized as a human right.37\\nRelevant financial indicators\\nRevenues and projected revenues affected due to production interruptions \\nor constraints on growth\\n\\uf0da loss of ecosystems services. A lack of integrated water management and sound public land\\nuse planning (destruction of watersheds or forested areas) can lead to losses of natural systems \\nfor cleaning water and storing water, and managing variability in precipitation and water flows,\\nincreasing costs of water delivery, and wastewater treatment, as well as increasing risk of shortages.\\nSome companies have recognized the value of protecting and restoring green infrastructure. \\nFor example, after its water prices rose in Colombia due to more intensive water treatment costs,\\nbrewer SABMiller helped fund a project in Bogota to protect a watershed used by eight million\\npeople and the company\\u2019s breweries.38\\nRelevant Financial Indicators\\nRevenues and projected revenues affected due to production interruptions \\nor inability to expand existing operations\\nHigher operating costs due to increased water or wastewater treatment rates\\n4. WATER POllUTION \\nThe pollution of water supplies is widespread, affecting both developed and developing countries.\\nPoor protection of water sources and inadequate treatment of wastewater creates risks, both \\nto companies that depend on clean water for processing and manufacturing activities, as well as\\nto employees and surrounding communities. \\nBusiness Impacts:\\n\\uf0da Higher treatment costs. The cost for water utilities to clean water to acceptable levels is\\nexpected to rise in many markets, a cost that will likely be passed on to industrial customers. \\nAnd where regulations are weak, the risks of being associated with pollution incidents are driving\\nincreased investment by food and beverage companies in additional on-site wastewater treatment\\nequipment. The Coca-Cola Company has invested more than $1 billion since 2001 in wastewater\\ntreatment, working with its local bottlers worldwide to reduce their polluted discharge.43\\nRelevant financial indicators\\nHigher operating costs due to increased water or wastewater rates\\nIncreased capital expenditures on wastewater treatment and recycling technologies\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 120\\n\\u201cAs water scarcity increases, competition for water between expanding households\\n(due to expected growing urbanization) and industry will continue to reduce the\\nshare of water available for agriculture.

ClIMATE CHANGE & WEATHER VARIABIlITy \\nHigher temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions are dramatically speeding up the global\\nwater cycle, unleashing more extreme rainfall events and intensifying droughts, according to the\\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Climate change is predicted to fundamentally\\nalter what can be grown where, and to negatively affect overall global agricultural productivity. This\\nwill increase the prices and price volatility of agricultural inputs that are used to feed livestock\\nand as direct ingredients for the food sector.46\\nMore intense droughts will also exacerbate many of the previous risk drivers discussed, as\\nalready strained water sources become even more challenging to manage. Higher rainfall could\\nincrease the amount of agricultural and industrial run-off, as well as animal and human waste\\nflowing into rivers and lakes. \\nBusiness Impacts:\\n\\uf0da Decreased agricultural productivity. Studies modeling climate change impacts on agricultural\\nproductivity predict that the global agricultural system as a whole will have difficulty supplying\\nadequate quantities of food at constant real prices.47 Few companies grow their own inputs and\\nmargin risks rise as commodities are affected by weather-related shocks and water scarcity. Weather-\\nrelated price shocks are not new, but coupled with increased competition for water in most major\\nagricultural production regions, there often aren\\u2019t enough commodity contracts available to offset \\na company\\u2019s different exposures (Exhibit 1.5). General Mills states in its 2014 CDP water information\\nrequest that it is a large buyer of U.S. wheat and notes that \\u201cif water becomes scarcer, it will likely\\ncost more to obtain ingredients such as wheat grown in this region.\\u201d \\nSome companies are already beginning to project the impacts of climate change on their own\\nagricultural procurement costs. Unilever estimates that natural disasters linked to changing climate,\\nin particular increases in food costs, water scarcity, and reduced productivity in many parts of the\\nagricultural supply chain, cost the company around $400 million annually.48, 49\\nRelevant financial indicators\\nHigher cost of goods sold due to reduced production of key agricultural inputs\\nRevenues and projected revenues negatively affected by shortages of key ingredients\\n\\uf0da Shifting production zones & asset stranding. Oxford University estimates that as much as\\n$11.2 trillion in agricultural assets, including processing plants, transportation and distribution\\nnetworks, could be stranded annually because of environmental risks including climate change\\nand water scarcity.55 As changes in precipitation patterns make water less plentiful in certain\\ngrowing regions, farmers will adapt over the medium to long-run by shifting crops or adopting new\\nagricultural practices. In the short-term, however, crop losses could force companies to pay higher\\ntransport costs to haul inputs from longer-distances and affect the value of certain logistical and\\nprocessing assets. Prolonged droughts transformed the U.S. beef business in recent years, with\\nTexas losing 24 percent of its herd between 2010 and 2014 and Nebraska replacing Texas as \\nthe biggest beef producing state.56 This dislocation has forced companies, including Cargill and\\nNational Beef, to close massive feedlots and meatpacking plants.57\\nRelevant financial indicators\\nRevenues and projected revenue negatively affected by shifts in availability \\nand location of agricultural inputs\\nImpaired assets values due to shifts in agricultural production zones\\nImplications for the Food Sector\\nInvestors are increasingly aware of the relevance of water risks for the food sector. Analyst\\nquestions and discussions about the earnings impacts of droughts and floods are becoming more\\nroutine on food company quarterly earnings calls (Exhibit 1.6). Eighty-two percent of food sector\\ncompanies responding to the 2014 CDP information request disclosed that they are exposed \\nto water risks and that these risks could have a substantive impact on business operations.58\\nCompanies are also increasingly acknowledging these risks in their financial filings: of the 31\\ncompanies evaluated in this report that are U.S.-based and publicly held, 90 percent cite water \\nas a risk in their 10-K filings, 65 percent citing physical risks (Exhibit 1.7).\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 122\\nWheat. With just six to 18 percent of the annual global wheat crop trading \\nacross borders, weather shocks in major wheat producing countries are felt\\ndisproportionately throughout the market.50 In 2010 and 2011, severe droughts \\nin Russia and China, along with flooding and severe heat in key exporting nations,\\ncaused wheat prices to more than double to $348 a metric ton.51\\nBeef. Extreme weather globally is significantly affecting beef production, causing\\nprices to spike in 2014 to all-time highs.52 Although exports from Brazil and India\\noffset declines in Australia and U.S., potential demand increases in the emerging\\nmarkets, which are driving the long-term growth of the sector, are stymied because\\nthere simply aren\\u2019t enough cattle to slaughter.

Corn prices have increased over the last 20 years, propelled by higher\\ndemand for food, grain feed for meat production and biofuel mandates. Extreme\\nflooding in 2011, followed by the drought in the U.S. Midwest cut corn production\\nby 11 percent in 2012, causing corn prices to hit a record high, $8 a bushel.54\\nExhibit 1.5: Impacts of Weather Shocks on Commodity Prices \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 1 23\\nGiven these trends, investors should be taking into account the water dependencies and risks\\npreviously outlined when analyzing the food sector, especially in regard to scenario and sensitivity\\nanalysis or stress testing. Investors will need to model a variety of factors, including the magnitude\\nof exposure, likelihood of risks within a given scenario and time frames. Company exposure to\\nthese financial risks will vary greatly based on geographic exposure, water use intensity, agricultural\\nsupply chain mix, and level of vertical integration. In light of the above, investors seeking to\\nunderstand the potential impact of water issues to a particular company\\u2019s financial performance\\nshould consider their water dependence, the security of the water resources they rely on and the\\nquality of their management response (Exhibit 1.8).\\nUsing the Transcript Analysis function available via Bloomberg, transcripts of quarterly earnings calls for \\nthe 37 food and beverage firms addressed in this report were examined for discussion of water risks material \\nto business performance.

More frequent and intense droughts are having devastating \\neffects on harvests, while water regulations are tightening up in many growing regions.\\n\\u25cf This chapter provides guidance to investors seeking to analyze corporate exposure to agricultural\\nwater risks. Risk exposure is shaped by several factors, including the primary agricultural\\ncommodities the company buys, the level of water dependence and security associated with \\nthose commodities, as well as the sourcing model used by the company to procure inputs.\\n\\u25cf As water supplies are increasingly depleted in major agricultural regions across the planet,\\ntraditional risk management approaches such as hedging and geographic diversification are\\nbecoming less effective. Companies can achieve more by engaging directly with their supply\\nchain to strengthen farmer practices and protect the watersheds from which they source. \\nRelevant tactics include setting supplier policies and sourcing goals, purchasing certified\\nsustainable commodities, collecting data from farmers on their practices while providing\\nassistance and incentives for improvement, as well as supporting on-the-ground watershed\\nprotection projects and backing more sustainable water management regulations.\\nDroughts are increasingly affecting food production. Droughts have become more frequent and\\nintense worldwide, affecting key production regions, including the U.S. Midwest and California,\\nSouth America and Australia. In 2014, Brazil\\u2019s worst drought in decades sent coffee prices spiking\\nnine percent on average, forcing Starbucks and J.M. Smucker to pass price increases onto\\nconsumers.3, 4 When New Zealand, the world\\u2019s largest dairy products exporter, was impacted \\nby drought in 2013 whole milk powder prices skyrocketed 64 percent.5\\nWater regulations are tightening up in many growing regions. Water authorities and regulators \\nare enacting new laws to control water use, reallocate agricultural water to urban and energy \\nneeds and regulate the water quality impacts of agriculture. These regulations have obvious\\nimplications for production costs. The State of California approved a comprehensive groundwater\\nlaw in 2014 that will have long-term impacts for agriculture, giving local authorities the right to \\nset sustainability targets, restrict groundwater pumping, shut down wells and impose fines.6 Even\\nbigger changes are taking place in Australia, which has transformed its traditional water rights\\nsystem after years of drought.7 In the United States, more lawsuits are being filed over agricultural\\npollution. In a potentially precedent-setting case, a federal judge in Washington ruled in 2015 \\nfor the first time that animal waste could be regulated as solid waste and not as a beneficial farm\\nproduct, after finding that a large industrial dairy\\u2019s handling of manure had polluted drinking water.8\\nInvestor Analysis of Water Risk in Agricultural Supply Chains\\nAnalysis of water risks in corporate supply chains is complex, however the following questions and\\nresources provide guidance for evaluating these risks, taking into consideration crop, geographic\\nand sourcing model considerations (Exhibit 2.3).\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 226\\nExhibit 2.2: Irrigated Crop Production in Regions of High Water Competition\\nFifty-six percent of all irrigated crop production takes place in regions of high or extremely high water competition, or \\u201cstress.\\u201d \\nForty percent of global food production relies on irrigation. \\nSource: World Resources Institute Aqueduct, \\u201cAgricultural Exposure to Water Stress,\\u201d available at: http://www.wri.org/applications/maps/agriculturemap/#x=0.00&y=-0.00&l=2&v=home&d=gmia\\nIrrigated Agriculture\\nBrightness shows density \\nof irrigated agriculture.

For companies\\nthat raise and source livestock or dairy products, it is important to consider the crops that are used\\nto feed animals\\u2014such as corn, soybeans and alfalfa\\u2014all of which have significant water demands.\\nOf the 37 companies analyzed in this report, the top ten most commonly sourced crops are: almonds,\\ncocoa, coffee, corn, grapes, palm oil, soybean, sugarcane, tomatoes and wheat. For company-specific\\ninformation on top commodity purchases, see Chapter 3, and for information on the water risks\\nassociated with the top ten crops, see Appendix C. \\nInvestors should also consider the degree to which certain ingredients can be easily substituted.\\nFor example, sugar from a drought-impacted sugarcane-growing region could be substituted in\\nmany products with corn syrup or sugar from sugar beets\\u2014although potentially not without additional\\nlogistics or processing costs. In addition, it is important to understand how diverse or limited a crop\\u2019s\\ngrowing regions may be. For example, nearly 80 percent of global almond production comes from\\nCalifornia\\u2019s drought-stricken Central Valley. In contrast, global soybean production is more evenly\\ndistributed across several countries and continents, providing more diversification of supply.\\nKey Indicators: Agricultural Commodity Exposure\\n\\u0002 Indicator \\u0006 Data Sources\\nTop agricultural inputs 10-K filings, annual reports, sustainability reports\\n% of key agricultural inputs that are non-substitutable \\ndue to distinctive attributes (flavor, texture, association with \\na branded product\\u2014e.g. \\u201cFig Newtons\\u201d)\\nCompany product/ingredient analysis\\n# of geographies where key agricultural inputs are grown \\n(i.e. whether there are many or few production regions globally\\nfrom which the input can be procured)\\nFAO Global Production Stats9\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 228\\nWater dependence & Security of Key Agricultural Commodities\\nTo analyze commodity water risk, investors need information on the relative water dependence of \\na crop\\u2014i.e. how much water it requires to grow, as well as the associated water pollution footprint\\u2014\\ncoupled with information on the security and health of the water resources on which the crop relies.\\nAlthough growing crops and raising livestock are by their nature water-intensive activities, the\\nwater footprints of different commodities vary significantly.

Agriculture relies on water in two forms: through\\ndirect precipitation (also known as \\u201crainfed\\u201d agriculture) and irrigation systems (water delivered\\nfrom surface water sources, such as streams, rivers and lakes, or groundwater from aquifers).\\nWhile only 18 percent of cropped acres globally are irrigated, these acres represent 40 percent \\nof total food production.11\\nRainfed and irrigated agriculture have different vulnerabilities. The productivity of rainfed\\nagriculture is subject to natural variability in precipitation such as drought and flooding, and\\nincreasingly to more extreme shifts in precipitation patterns due to climate change. The long-term\\nproductivity of irrigated agriculture requires healthy, functioning watersheds, including abundant\\nstream flows and groundwater that ensure regular, dependable access to water supplies for\\nagriculture as well as other uses. \\nEighty percent of the world\\u2019s cropland and more than 60 percent of the world\\u2019s cereal grains\\nrely on rainfed production.12 In Africa, 95 percent of agricultural land is rainfed; in China 70 percent;\\nand in India 60 percent.13 The water productivity of rainfed agriculture overall tends to be low, while\\nwater losses from evaporation are high. This isn\\u2019t because of the volume of rainfall, but because \\nof soil degradation and poor methods for managing the rain when it falls, especially during floods\\nand dry spells.14\\nSource: Water Footprint Product Gallery, Water footprint Network, http://www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/productgallery\\nRainfed agriculture is especially vulnerable to climate change. Modeling of expected climate\\nchange impacts show that precipitation variability is increasing along with more extreme weather,\\naccording to the UN\\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).26 Under most climate\\nscenarios, precipitation is expected to increase in the tropics and higher latitudes, and drop further\\nin semi-arid to arid mid-latitudes and the interior of large continents, affecting key growing regions.27\\nClimate change could reduce yields of major rainfed cereal crops in Africa, including wheat yields\\nfalling as much as 35 percent south of the Sahara and corn yields dropping in excess of 30 percent\\nin South Africa and Zimbabwe by 2050.28 In Central America, the northeast of Brazil and parts of\\nthe Andes, increases in temperature and decreases in rainfall are expected to reduce crop productivity\\nfor rice, wheat and corn as well as high value commodities such as coffee.29 Nicaragua could see\\nan 80 percent decline in land suitable for coffee by 2050.30\\nThe global trend is toward more irrigated production. Irrigated production is more than twice \\nas productive on a per hectare basis than rainfed production.31 However this water use contributes\\nto significant shortages and environmental degradation in many regions: roughly 70 percent of all\\naccessible water is used for irrigation globally, though that can reach as high as 90 percent in some\\ncountries.32 As a response to climate change, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)33\\nforesees a 25 percent increase in irrigated areas in developing regions. \\nIrrigated production poses higher costs to ecosystems. Most irrigated production globally is in \\narid, dry regions threatened by drought. It also competes with other uses, is one of the most energy-\\nintensive uses of water and increases the risk of soil salinization and waterlogging. In many regions,\\nwater supplies used for agriculture are highly stressed from excessive demand and unregulated\\nuse. Combined, these pressures are leading to the drying up of water supplies in key growing\\nregions\\u2014from large-scale groundwater losses in California\\u2019s Central Valley to the disappearance \\nof Central Asia\\u2019s Aral Sea due to massive water diversions for irrigating cotton fields.34\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 2 29\\nAgriculture\\u2019s Impacts on Water Quality\\nWater pollution from farming is rising, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\\n(OECD).15 Erosion of topsoil and associated fertilizer run-off, both chemical and manure, is the most significant source of\\nagricultural water pollution. Global chemical fertilizer use, which hit 180 million tons in 2012,16 has increased 500 percent\\nover the past 50 years, with nitrogen alone growing by 800 percent.17 Because much of this fertilizer isn\\u2019t completely\\nabsorbed by plants, tens of millions of tons of nitrogen and phosphorus run off into waterways, polluting rivers,\\ngroundwater and oceans annually. The number of hypoxic \\u201cdead zones\\u201d linked to fertilizer run-off has increased\\nexponentially since the 1960s, affecting more than 400 aquatic ecosystems worldwide, including the Gulf of Mexico\\nand South China Sea.18 According to the EPA, nutrient pollution is the most significant water quality challenge\\nfacing the United States, which spends an estimated $4.8 billion annually treating nitrogen pollution.19\\nAnimal manure resulting from industrial animal production is another significant source of water pollution. In the\\nUnited States, it is estimated that livestock produce as much as 1.2 to 1.37 billion tons of waste a year and that\\nconcentrated feeding operations account for 16 percent of agricultural water pollution.20, 21 In the wake of a run-off induced\\ntoxic algae bloom in Lake Erie in summer 2014, which shut down water supplies to the city of Toledo, the Governor of\\nOhio recently signed legislation requiring dairies and livestock producers to change the way they handle manure.22\\nThe use of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides to protect crops and boost yields is also increasing, with pesticide\\nuse alone reaching 5.2 billion tons worldwide in 2007.23 Pesticides can leach into ground and surface waters and\\nhave been found in significant concentrations in many regions.24 Syngenta, the world\\u2019s largest pesticide manufacturer,\\npaid $105 million in 2012 to settle a class action suit filed by U.S. Midwest water utilities that spent millions over\\nthe years filtering the herbicide atrazine from public water supplies. Atrazine is widely used by farmers in the Corn Belt,\\nbut banned in Europe.25\\nGroundwater is an essential and increasingly imperiled source of irrigation water. Its use in\\nirrigation is increasing both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total irrigation.35 Globally, about\\n43 percent of the water used for irrigation comes from groundwater.36 Irrigation is the single largest\\nuser of groundwater in water scarce regions. An estimated 20 percent of the Earth\\u2019s groundwater\\nbasins or aquifers are being over-exploited, many of them in regions of significant agricultural\\nimportance (Exhibit 2.5).37 New satellite data in 2014 confirmed that the amount of water stored \\nin seven of the world\\u2019s major aquifers, including California\\u2019s Central Valley, the northern Middle East, \\nand the Guarani aquifer in central South America, have dropped significantly since the early 2000s.38\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 230\\nExhibit 2.5: Unsustainable Groundwater Use in Areas Important to Agriculture \\nLevels of Water Stress:\\n\\u0005 Low \\n\\u0005 Low - Medium \\n\\u0005 Medium - High \\n\\u0005 High (40-80%)\\n\\u0005 Extremely High \\n\\u0005 Arid & Low Water Use\\nA significant number of groundwater basins important to agriculture face high to extremely high stress, meaning that unsustainable groundwater \\nuse could affect groundwater availability and groundwater-dependent surface water and ecosystems. \\nKey Indicators: Water dependence & Security of Agricultural Commodities\\n\\u0002 Indicator \\u0006 Data Sources\\nRelative water requirements of key commodities Water Footprint Network\\u2019s WaterStat,39 FAO AQUASTAT, company\\nlifecycle analysis (sustainability reports), USDA Farm and Ranch\\nIrrigation Survey\\n% of agricultural spend or volume exposed \\nto drought conditions\\nU.S. Drought Monitor, WRI Aqueduct (Drought Severity data layer)\\n% of agricultural procurement spend or volume\\nassociated with rainfed versus irrigated production\\nManagement  \\n% of agricultural procurement spend or volume\\nassociated with crops grown in high water risk \\nor highly water-stressed regions\\nCDP water questionnaire; data on irrigated crops & water stress: \\nWRI Aqueduct agriculture map; for a broader set of crops and water\\nrisk indicators, see WWF Water Risk Filter & Appendix C of this report\\n% of agricultural procurement spend or volume\\ncoming from regions of groundwater depletion\\nWRI Aqueduct (Groundwater Stress data layer), USGS report:\\nGroundwater Depletion in the United States40\\n% of agricultural procurement spend or volume\\nassociated with crops that have high fertilizer \\nor pesticide use\\nManagement\\nSource: WRI Aqueduct, with underlying data from Tom Gleeson et al., \\u201cWater Balance of Global Aquifers Revealed \\nby Groundwater Footprint,\\u201d Nature, 488 (7410), 197-200, 9 August 2012.\\nAgricultural Sourcing Models\\nThe way that companies source agricultural inputs\\u2014directly from farmers, through co-ops and\\nwholesalers, or through multiple levels of intermediaries or commodities markets\\u2014shapes the \\nlevel of influence and menu of opportunities available to them for improving the sustainability \\nof farming practices.\\nAgricultural supply chains are highly complex and often lack traceability. Company influence over\\nsuppliers varies depending on the firm and the commodities. Some meat and agricultural products\\ncompanies are vertically integrated, but many food sector companies are often four-plus links from\\nthe agricultural producer. Significant traceability challenges often exist in terms of understanding the\\ngeographic origin of a particular input and what intermediaries it passes through. Companies may\\nhave a wide variety of sourcing structures for different divisions, products and manufacturing facilities.\\nThis means that a box of tea on the shelves of a supermarket may include leaves bought from many\\ndifferent international commodity traders, while another brand of tea sold by the same company may\\ncontain leaves from a specific farm or co-op that is traceable at every stage of production.\\nTraceability challenges mean that many companies may be unaware of their exposure to water-\\nrelated risks. In 2013, when horse meat was discovered in Europe in products labeled as beef,\\nincluding meatballs from Ikea and Nestl\\u00e9 frozen pasta meals, and monthly frozen burger sales\\nplunged by as much as 41 percent, the scramble to pinpoint the meat source highlighted traceability\\nissues within the food supply chain.41\\nKey Indicators: Agricultural Sourcing Models\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 2 31\\n\\u0002 Indicator \\u0006 Data Sources\\n% of agricultural procurement spend or volume sourced directly from\\nagricultural producers \\n10-K, sustainability reports, management\\n% of agricultural procurement spend or volume that is traceable down \\nto the field level (i.e. specific geographic origins of the product are known)\\nSustainability reports, management\\nApproaches to Managing Agricultural Water Risk\\nGiven the water risks associated with a company\\u2019s top agricultural commodities and its sourcing\\nmodel, companies have a range of risk management approaches available to them. However, as\\nwater supplies become overexploited in many major growing regions across the planet, traditional\\napproaches to managing commodity price risk\\u2014such as hedging and geographic diversification\\u2014\\nare becoming less effective. Companies may achieve more by working with agricultural producers to\\nlower their water impacts, while also investing to support watershed resilience in key growing regions.\\nFarm-level Practices \\nWhile global agricultural production has become dramatically more efficient and productive in many\\nregions over the past 50 years, many opportunities exist to improve soil health, further optimize resource\\nefficiency, slow or halt groundwater depletion and minimize downstream water quality impacts. Below\\nare some of the key practices that can be pursued\\u2014often at relatively low cost and with a demonstrated\\neconomic return. It should be noted that the applicability of specific practices will vary greatly depending\\non differences in crop water needs, farm size, soil types, local climates and watershed conditions.\\n\\uf0da Enhanced soil management. Soil health, defined as the continued capacity of soil to function \\nas a living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals and humans, is arguably the most important\\nindicator of agricultural resilience to drought and extremes in precipitation.42 A variety of agricultural soil\\nmanagement practices can enable soil to increase water retention during dry spells, reduce the erosion\\nimpacts of flooding and provide more productive and reliable yields. No-till farming, which involves\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 232\\nseeding directly into crop residues rather than disturbing the soil to improve soil quality and increase\\nwater infiltration, has been shown in the case of corn production to yield 24 percent more bushels per\\nacre and use 32 percent fewer gallons of water each year than conventional tilling.43 Other practices,\\nincluding cover cropping (planting non-commodity crops, such as legumes or plant grasses to protect\\nand improve the soil), and crop rotation are important tools for preventing soil erosion and supporting\\nrelationships between plants and soil microbes that improve crop uptake of water and nutrients.44\\n\\uf0da Water use productivity. Researchers have identified that in many dry regions, 40 percent \\nof total water used is being applied to fields that produce just 20 percent of total food calories.45\\nIn combination with existing rainfall, practices such as reducing soil erosion and improving soil\\nnutrients could increase annual food production in rainfed croplands by enough to feed 110 million\\npeople.46 In areas of irrigated cropland, raising the level of calories produced per drop could reduce\\nwater consumption enough to meet the annual domestic water demand of 1.4 billion people.47\\nThere are three key principles for improving water productivity at the farm and watershed level, which\\napply regardless of whether a crop is grown under rainfed or irrigated conditions: 1) increasing the\\nmarketable yield of the crop for each unit of water it consumes, 2) reducing non-beneficial water\\nconsumption, including water loss through evapotranspiration from soil or water surfaces, and 3) making\\nmore effective use of rainfall.48 A range of practices and technologies can support these principles,\\nfrom improved seeds to advanced drip irrigation to better practices for capturing and storing rainfall.49\\nIt is important to recognize that a farm-level focus on increasing water efficiency\\u2014or increasing crop\\nper drop\\u2014often results in the saved water being applied to additional agricultural uses, which can\\nfail to reduce overall withdrawals from stressed water sources.50 Without regulations that encourage\\noverall reductions in water use at the watershed level, individual field-level efficiency improvements\\nmay still contribute to depletion of water supplies and environmental degradation.\\n\\uf0da Improved fertilizer management. Some regions use too much fertilizer, while others, particularly\\nin parts of Africa, need to use more.51 Just under a quarter of the world\\u2019s cropland generates half \\nof all fertilizer waste.52 China, India and the U.S. are responsible for two-thirds of nitrogen and\\nphosphorus waste, while three crops\\u2014rice, wheat and corn\\u2014generate 60 percent of all fertilizer\\nwaste.53 Targeted cuts in fertilizer use in this small set of crops and countries could have a big\\nimpact on water pollution, without hurting yields. A recent study estimates that current crop yields\\nfor wheat, rice and corn in China, the U.S., and India, could be maintained while cutting nitrogen\\nuse by 14 to 29 percent and phosphorus by 13 to 22 percent.54 Best management practices include\\nmatching the type and amount of nutrients to each crop\\u2019s needs, careful timing of fertilization and\\ninjecting fertilizer directly into the soil.\\nCompany Practices\\nThere is much companies can do to incentivize and support farmers in adapting their practices, \\nas well as investing more broadly in the health of the watersheds from which they are sourcing. \\n\\uf0da Sustainable agriculture policies and goals. Companies send an important signal to the\\nagricultural supply chain by developing policies and setting goals that articulate an intention to\\nsource commodities that are grown with reduced water impacts. A number of food sector companies\\nincluding Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Unilever have released detailed agricultural policies while others,\\nincluding General Mills and Kellogg, have set time-bound sustainable sourcing commitments. \\n\\uf0da Data collection & benchmarking. A broad range of tools and initiatives are being created to\\nhelp track water use, fertilizer and pesticide management practices by farmers. Many companies\\nincluding Campbell Soup, PepsiCo, Sysco, Unilever and Wal-Mart are using surveys to collect\\ndata on farm-level practices and environmental impacts. Unilever, which aims to have 100 percent\\nsustainably sourced ingredients by 2020, is monitoring suppliers and farmers using a self-assessment\\nsoftware tool that collects data on compliance and tracks improvement against the goals of the\\nUnilever Sustainable Agriculture Code.55 Berry company Driscoll\\u2019s collects water use data from \\nits California Central Coast growers through an automated system which transmits data in real-time\\nfrom water meters. The data is then aggregated to provide growers with benchmark data on their\\nWithout regulations \\nthat encourage overall\\nreductions in water use\\nat the watershed level,\\nindividual field-level\\nefficiency improvements\\nmay still contribute \\nto depletion of water\\nsupplies & environmental\\ndegradation.\\nwater use versus that of other growers.56 Industry-level efforts to develop consistent data collection\\napproaches are also emerging. These include Field to Market, the Stewardship Index for Specialty\\nCrops, the Sustainability Consortium and the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy.\\n\\uf0da Commodity certification. Certification programs that provide assurance that certain aspects of\\nagricultural production are undertaken in accordance with good environmental practices are one\\nstrategy available to companies. However, lack of traceability in certain commodity markets is a\\nsignificant challenge to the broadening of certification systems beyond specialty crops. Additionally,\\nthe degree to which water quantity and water quality issues are reflected in different commodity\\ncertifications varies widely. \\n\\uf0da Agronomic assistance. Agronomic services that introduce and train farmers on practices that\\nsupport more resilient water outcomes can be provided directly by companies, their suppliers \\nor in partnership with third parties such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government\\nagencies and universities. In 2014, Unilever partnered with the Dutch NGO Solidaridad to pool\\npublic and private grants, credits and investments to promote water efficiency techniques and\\neducation among sugarcane, cotton, soy and tea farmers in India with the goal of saving 400 billion\\nto one trillion liters of water in three years.57\\n\\uf0da Financial incentives. Incentive payments, subsidies, and low-interest loan programs are\\neconomic instruments used to encourage adoption of approaches and technologies for reducing\\nwater use and fertilizer runoff. In the Irapuato region of Mexico, General Mills is providing interest-\\nfree loans to broccoli and cauliflower growers to speed up adoption of drip irrigation technology,\\nhelping save an estimated 1.1 billion gallons of water annually.58 To mitigate fears that piloting \\nnew water or nutrient and pesticide management systems will lead to lower yields, companies and\\norganizations can design programs that provide \\u201cperformance guarantees.\\u201d These guarantees offer\\nfarmers a set price regardless of yield or quality of their crops. Through the American Farmland\\nTrust\\u2019s risk-sharing programs, farmers have cut fertilizer use by 24 percent.59\\nSome companies are paying higher prices for products, particularly coffee and cocoa, grown using\\nsustainable farming approaches such as watershed management, mulching and drip irrigation. Long-\\nterm or preferential contracting is another tool. ADM, in partnership with its customer Unilever, is paying\\nIowa farmers a 10-cent a bushel premium for soybeans from farms enrolled in the Field to Market\\nprogram, which helps farmers evaluate ways to reduce the environmental impacts of their practices.60\\n\\uf0da Watershed protection and public policy engagement. Most agricultural water challenges are\\ncollective, and solving them requires shared action by all stakeholders, as well as government\\npolicies that support conservation, water quality improvements and integrated water management.\\nCompanies can play a role in collaborative efforts to protect and restore agricultural watersheds \\nby providing direct investments in on-the ground projects that improve local conditions and ensure\\nlong-term continuity of agricultural production. Companies can also actively support government\\npolicies that achieve sustainable water use in the regions where they source. For example, Coca-\\nCola, Driscoll\\u2019s and General Mills are members of the Connect the Drops campaign, a business\\nadvocacy initiative that supports sustainable water management policies in California.61\\nKey Indicators: Managing Agricultural Water Risk\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 2 33\\n\\u0002 Indicator \\u0006 Data Sources\\n% of producers in supply chain showing continuous improvement on water-related outcomes\\n(water use productivity, nutrient application, soil health, etc.)\\nCompany has a sustainable agriculture policy & time-bound sourcing goals that address water\\nCompany gathers data from agricultural producers on the water impacts of their farming practices\\nCompany offers educational support, technology or financial incentives to agricultural\\nproducers in supply chain to improve water management\\nCompany sources certified commodities, where relevant\\nCompany has collaborative, watershed protection plans that are linked to sourcing regions \\nof high water risk\\nChapters 3 & 4 \\nof this report,\\nsustainability\\nreports, CDP\\u2019s \\nwater questionnaire,\\nmanagement\\nMethodology\\nThirty-seven major food companies in four industries were evaluated for their strength in managing\\nwater risks across their direct operations and supply chains.

For a more\\nin-depth discussion of results within each water management category, see Chapter 4.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 3 41\\nOverall performance\\nEvidence of strong water management response by some companies, but relatively weak\\nperformance overall. Top performers by industry were: \\nPackaged Food\\n\\u2014 70 points \\u2014\\nUnilever\\nBeverage\\n\\u2014 67 points \\u2014\\nThe Coca-Cola\\nCompany\\nMeat\\n\\u2014 33 points \\u2014\\nSmithfield Foods\\nAgricultural Products\\n\\u2014 29 points \\u2014\\nBunge\\nCompanies in the packaged food and beverage industries had stronger overall performance\\nthan meat and agricultural products companies. The packaged food and beverage industries\\nhad median scores of 27 and 26.5, respectively, while agricultural products and meat companies\\nwere 13.5 and 10, respectively. \\nCorporate Governance of Water Risk\\n\\uf0da Water risk is a corporate governance priority for many of the companies evaluated.\\nForty-three percent (19) of companies across all four industries have oversight for water risk at\\nthe board level. Fifty-one percent of companies have senior level management oversight of water risk.\\n\\uf0da Despite this, strong board oversight did not consistently translate into strong overall performance.\\nOf the 16 companies with board oversight, most performed poorly overall, with more than 60 percent\\nreceiving fewer than 35 total points. \\n\\uf0da Few companies tie water performance to executive compensation. Molson Coors and Campbell\\u2019s\\nare among four companies that offer explicit financial incentives to executive officers and the \\nCEO for water-related performance. \\n\\uf0da Only two companies report using a shadow price of water to analyze the ROI of water-\\nefficiency investments. In most of the world, water is low-cost or free for industry, failing to reflect\\nits true scarcity and value. Anticipating future price hikes, both Unilever and Nestl\\u00e9 use a shadow\\nprice for water to calculate the return of efficiency investments while also meeting hurdle rates.\\nNestl\\u00e9 places a theoretical price on water depending on the water stress of a factory location \\nto help the company better prioritize investments in high water risk regions. \\n\\uf0da Only seven companies\\u2014all of them in the packaged food and beverage industries\\u2014acknowledged\\nthat access to drinking water and sanitation are fundamental human rights.3 Having provided\\nformal recognition that water is a human right as voted upon by the United Nations (UN) General\\nAssembly in 2010, some companies are following suit by evaluating the human rights impacts \\nof their water management practices. \\n\\uf0da Few companies are actively supporting reform of public policies that would result in more\\nsustainable water management. Given generally weak water governance in high water stress\\nregions throughout the world, there is a business interest in advocating for much needed water\\nreforms. Coca-Cola and General Mills are members of the Connect the Drops campaign4\\na business advocacy initiative organized by Ceres that supports more sustainable water\\nmanagement policies in the state of California. \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 342\\ndirect Operations\\n\\uf0da A majority of companies (23) have begun to evaluate water risks in their direct operations,\\nbut two-thirds (22) are still not evaluating water issues in their agricultural supply chains.\\nCoca-Cola, PepsiCo and Unilever are among the few companies that conducted comprehensive\\nwater risks assessments throughout their operations and supply chains.  \\n\\uf0da Nearly one-third of companies (11) fail to report basic water data. While half the companies\\nreported data on overall water use, few reported a full range of water accounting data. Brown-\\nForman, ConAgra and Kellogg are among the companies reporting the most data for their facilities.\\n\\uf0da 70 percent (26) have set targets to reduce water use in their direct operations, but the\\naggressiveness of these targets varies. Molson Coors has set risk-differentiated targets, requiring\\nthat all its breweries in high water risk regions achieve higher water efficiency levels than breweries\\nin less stressed locations. \\n\\uf0da Water quality issues get less priority, with only two companies reporting goals to reduce\\nwastewater discharges and improve water quality beyond compliance requirements. Coca-\\nCola has a global wastewater standard for its facilities that sets a limit for maximum loading\\nvalues for major contaminants, unless more stringent regulatory standards apply. Nestl\\u00e9 has \\na goal to implement new requirements for water quality and effluent discharge in its factories.\\nThe company has initiated a survey to identify gaps in existing wastewater treatment\\ninfrastructure and established targeted investments in the facilities that need it most. \\n\\uf0da Only a few companies\\u2014Coca-Cola, General Mills and Molson Coors\\u2014have developed\\ncollaborative watershed protection plans in high water risk regions. Collaborative efforts that\\nseek to restore watershed functions and invest in highest-return water conservation opportunities\\nallow companies to help mitigate collective water risks, often at a lower cost than would be\\nrequired to drive further operational efficiencies.\\nManufacturing Supply Chain\\n\\uf0da Nearly one-quarter of companies (9) ask manufacturing suppliers to report on water use,\\nwastewater discharge and management practices. General Mills and Campbell Soup ask\\nsuppliers to complete supplier scorecards that include water use sections. Hershey and\\nUnilever use Sedex (a platform for sharing supply chain data) to query suppliers on water\\nmanagement, use and risks. \\n\\uf0da Only five companies require their manufacturing suppliers to establish their own water\\nmanagement programs. Coca-Cola requires its bottling suppliers to complete a source water\\nvulnerability assessment that evaluates risks to the company and surrounding communities,\\nand to develop and implement source water protection plans.\\nAgricultural Supply Chain\\n\\uf0da Only six companies have a sustainable agriculture policy that addresses water. PepsiCo\\u2019s\\npolicy includes the objective to \\u201coptimize the applied water footprint to crops and to reduce water\\nwaste during irrigation as well as responsibly manage runoff risks of pollution or contamination\\nof ground or surface water with pesticides, nutrients or soil.\\u201d5 Unilever has an Agricultural Code\\nof Conduct that includes an entire section focused on water use and pollution and defines practices\\nwith which agricultural producers are expected to comply. \\n\\uf0da Despite the lack of policies, 41 percent (15) of companies have set time-bound goals \\nto source agricultural products more sustainably. For many companies, however, these\\ncommitments were limited to only one or two commodities. Only two meat companies had\\ngoals. Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kellogg and Unilever are the only companies that have set\\ntime-bound goals to source the majority of their agricultural inputs sustainably.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 3 43\\n\\uf0da 43 percent (16) of companies gather data from agricultural producers on the water impacts \\nof their farming practices. ADM, Bunge, Coca-Cola and Kellogg are collecting data from \\nsome producers through their participation in Field to Market. Some Brown-Forman growers \\nare reporting water data through self-assessments as members of the California Sustainable\\nWinegrowing Alliance (CSWA) and the Wine Institute. \\n\\uf0da One-third (12) of companies provide educational support to growers through tools, advising\\nand training programs. Molson Coors has developed a tool to support UK barley growers\\nin assessing their water use and finding ways to save money and manage water holistically. \\nJBS offers consultations with technicians to support producers in implementing rainwater harvesting,\\nbiodigesting and composting initiatives. ConAgra provides support to potato growers through a\\nprogram that allows them to self-evaluate their farming operations, compare themselves to other\\ngrowers and identify practices they can implement to improve their performance.\\n\\uf0da Only four companies offer financial support to help growers farm more sustainably.\\nWhiteWave\\u2019s Horizon Organic Producer Education (HOPE) program invests directly in growers\\nlooking to transition to organic farming. General Mills provides Mexican growers with interest-\\nfree loans to invest in more efficient drip irrigation.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 444\\nBenchmark Results: Findings \\nby Water Management Category\\nCHApTER 4\\nExhibit 4.1: Governance & Management Performance\\n25\\n20\\n15\\n10\\n5\\n0\\npo\\nin\\nts\\nKey\\nMaximum \\u00ae\\nMinimum \\u00ae\\nMedian \\u00ae\\nMAxIMUM POINTS\\npackaged FoodMeatBeverageAgricultural products\\nCategory: Governance & Management\\nThis category assesses the level of board and senior management oversight of water-related issues,\\nties between executive compensation and water performance, and key business planning activities\\nthat take water into account.

While many of these companies disclosed to CDP that their boards have oversight \\nof water-related risks, none of their board committee charters made explicit reference to water.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 4 45\\nExhibit 4.2: Companies with Board Oversight\\nAgricultural products\\nBeverage\\nMeat\\npackaged Food\\n(3)\\n(2)\\n(2)\\n(9)\\n50%\\n33%\\n33%\\n47%\\n0% 100%\\nOnly three of the companies disclosed that company executives regularly brief the board on\\nwater-related issues. Board briefings send a clear signal to investors that board oversight is more\\nthan a formality and directors are playing a more active role in overseeing water-related risks. \\nSenior Executive Oversight\\nFor half (19) of the companies evaluated, management-level oversight for water was relegated\\nto executives at least two levels below the CEO (Exhibit 4.3). Twelve of the 37 companies indicated\\nthat oversight for water management lay with an individual who reported directly to the CEO or\\nChairman. Oversight for water at Smithfield falls under the responsibility of the Chief Sustainability\\nOfficer, who reports directly to the CEO and sits on the leadership team. At Keurig, the company\\u2019s\\nChief Strategy and Sustainability Officer has responsibility for social and environmental initiatives\\nand reports directly to the President and CEO. \\nBoard Committee\\nwith Oversight \\nfor Environment \\nor Sustainability:\\n\\u2022 Bunge\\n\\u2022 Chiquita Brands\\n\\u2022 The Coca-Cola\\nCompany\\n\\u2022 ConAgra Foods\\n\\u2022 dean Foods\\n\\u2022 dr. pepper \\nSnapple Group\\n\\u2022 General Mills\\n\\u2022 Ingredion\\n\\u2022 JBS\\n\\u2022 Kellogg\\n\\u2022 Keurig Green Mountain\\n\\u2022 Mead Johnson\\n\\u2022 Mondele\\u02c9z\\nInternational\\n\\u2022 pepsiCo \\n\\u2022 Smithfield \\n\\u2022 Unilever \\nWater Tied to Executive Compensation\\nFour of the 37 companies\\u2014all within the packaged food and beverage industries\\u2014incorporate\\nwater explicitly as part of their executive compensation structure, specifically with respect to\\nvariable compensation (Exhibit 4.4). \\nExhibit 4.3: Companies with Senior Executive Oversight\\nAgricultural products\\nBeverage\\nMeat\\npackaged Food\\n(2)\\n(5)\\n(2)\\n(10)\\n83%\\n33%\\n53%\\n0% 100%\\n33%\\nPercent of Companies\\nPercent of Companies\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 446\\nExhibit 4.4: Water Tied to Executive Compensation\\nCampbell Soup Campbell\\u2019s has \\u201cbrought corporate social responsibility into our executive compensation system andincluded important metrics on energy, water, waste, safety and ethics.\\u201d1\\ndean Foods At Dean Foods, CEO and executive officers receive a financial incentive for achieving sustainability goals, which include a \\u201cwater per gallon\\u201d key performance indicator.\\nMolson Coors Molson Coors offers monetary rewards to the CEO, the management group and business unit managersbased on performance of \\u201cwater consumption per hl [hectoliter] of production metric.\\u201d\\nUnilever CEO\\u2019s personal performance goals and bonus are linked to progress on the company\\u2019s CSR goals and itsSustainable Living Plan.\\nConsiders Water in Strategy & Business planning\\nOnly 30 percent (11) of companies indicated that water risks were considered as part of major\\nbusiness planning activities and investment decision-making. Mead Johnson, for example, \\nstates that \\u201cwe consider the availability of water when selecting new business locations, and we \\nseek to achieve efficient use of water resources at all our facilities worldwide.\\u201d2 Constellation takes\\nthis a step further by disclosing that it conducts water risk assessments for all new acquisitions \\nand expansions of existing facilities. \\nAlthough water is notoriously underpriced in most markets, Nestl\\u00e9 and Unilever are the only\\ncompanies in this assessment that disclose using a \\u201ctrue\\u201d cost for water for key business planning\\ndecisions. Nestl\\u00e9 uses an internal \\u201cshadow price\\u201d of just over $1 per cubic meter for sites where\\nthere is abundant water and approximately $5 in drier regions.\\nInternal policies that guide procurement decisions with respect to water were disclosed by five\\ncompanies: including Coca-Cola, Molson Coors, Nestl\\u00e9, PepsiCo and Unilever. Coca-Cola, for\\nexample, has developed a sustainable sourcing \\u201cplaybook\\u201d for its procurement leads to ensure\\nalignment between sustainability policies and targets and internal sourcing decisions. \\nEvaluating Water Risks\\nAcross the companies evaluated, 38 percent (14) have not begun to evaluate water risks at all. The highest\\nperformers were found in the packaged food and beverage industries, which on average achieved 85 percent \\nof the available points allotted to risk assessment indicators (Exhibit 4.5). \\n63 percent of packaged food companies, 50 percent of beverage companies and one-third of both meat \\nand agricultural products companies analyzed water risks in their supply chains.\\nThe robustness of corporate water risk assessments can be evaluated in various ways:\\n\\u25cf Do the risk assessments extend beyond direct operations to include manufacturing and agricultural suppliers? \\n\\u25cf Does the company analyze both external watershed conditions that may drive water risk, as well as the\\nimpacts of their own operations on ecosystems and communities?\\n\\u25cf Does the company use more than one third-party tool or data set to analyze its water risks?\\n\\u25cf Does the company use forward-looking models or scenarios to identify the likelihood and severity of future\\nrisks, such as the potential impacts of climate change and increased competition for water resources? \\n38%\\nOf companies have not begun\\nto evaluate water risks.\\nAnalyzed water risks \\nin their supply chains.\\n50% 33%\\n33%63%\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 4 47\\nCategory: direct Operations\\nManaging water use and wastewater discharge in direct operations is a long-standing priority for\\nmany companies in the food sector, with particularly strong performance shown by the beverage\\nand packaged food industries (Exhibit 4.6). \\n30\\n25\\n20\\n15\\n10\\n5\\n0\\npo\\nin\\nts\\nMAxIMUM POINTS\\nExhibit 4.6: Direct Operations Performance\\nAgricultural products Beverage Meat packaged Food\\nKey\\nMaximum \\u00ae\\nMinimum \\u00ae\\nMedian \\u00ae\\nExhibit 4.5: Water Risk Assessment\\n20\\n15\\n10\\n5\\n0\\npo\\nin\\nts\\nMAxIMUM POINTS\\nAgricultural products Beverage Meat packaged Food\\nKey\\nMaximum \\u00ae\\nMinimum \\u00ae\\nMedian \\u00ae\\ndirect Operations\\nTop Performers\\nTotal Points Available \\nin Category: \\n30/100\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 448\\nWater Accounting data \\nSeventy percent (26) of all companies evaluated report basic data on overall corporate water use\\n(withdrawals or consumption), 35 percent (13) report data on total wastewater discharge volumes, \\nbut only 27 percent (10) disclose both of these basic data points for all of their significant facilities\\n(Exhibit 4.7).

Four companies reported absolute reduction\\ntargets, while the rest reported normalized or eco-efficiency targets. Companies with the strongest targets\\nused a risk-differentiated approach, which involved setting more aggressive targets for regions or facilities\\nfacing higher levels of water stress or risk. Two companies\\u2014Molson Coors and Nestl\\u00e9\\u2014reported risk-\\ndifferentiated targets. Molson Coors has an overall target to reduce water intensity by 15 percent by\\n2020 from a 2011 baseline, and requires that all its breweries in high water risk regions achieve \\n\\u201ca world class water efficiency [ratio] of 3.0 to 3.5 hl/hl depending on the complexity of the brewery.\\u201d3\\nExhibit 4.8: Water Reduction Targets\\nAgricultural products\\nBeverage\\nMeat\\npackaged Food\\n(5)\\n(4)\\n(3)\\n(14)\\n83%\\n67%\\n50%\\n74%\\n0% 100%Percent of Companies\\nPercent of Companies\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 4 49\\nWatershed protection plans\\nWater is a shared resource and presents a shared risk to the many users\\u2014industry, cities and farmers\\u2014that depend\\non it. For companies, even achieving best-in-class facility level water efficiency may not be sufficient to mitigate\\nthe physical, regulatory or reputational risks that result from the broader mismanagement of local water resources. \\nIn many regions of the world, collaborative efforts to protect and restore watersheds are a critical approach for\\ncatalyzing the public and private investment needed to improve the conditions of rivers, lakes, groundwater and\\nrelated ecosystems on which a company\\u2019s facilities and supply chains depend. Some companies are developing\\nwatershed protection plans that focus targeted corporate resources on various activities\\u2014river restoration and aquifer\\nreplenishment projects, among others\\u2014typically in areas of high water risk and in partnership with local stakeholders.\\nThis approach allows various stakeholders to share the burden of what is often a complex, resource-intensive task.\\nOnly four of the companies\\u2014Coca-Cola, General Mills, Molson Coors and pepsiCo\\u2014have developed watershed\\nprotection plans for their direct operations. Of these, two have plans that extend beyond watersheds associated with their\\ndirect operations to include those of key manufacturing suppliers or agricultural sourcing regions.  \\nGeneral Mills has established watershed stewardship plans for key at-risk regions, which the company identified\\nin partnership with The Nature Conservancy. Priority watersheds include a growing region in Irapuato, Mexico,\\nwhere vegetables are grown and packaged, as well as a growing region in the Snake River region of Idaho where\\nagricultural producers grow wheat for the company. In addition to identifying current and future risks to these\\nwatersheds, General Mills seeks to identify stakeholders that are contributing to the depletion and pollution of \\nthe watersheds as well as opportunities for collaboration through education and advocacy efforts.\\nWastewater Reduction Targets\\nMost companies assessed do not disclose the percentage of their facilities that are in compliance\\nwith local wastewater discharge regulations. In addition, only two of the companies evaluated\\u2014\\nCoca-Cola and Nestl\\u00e9\\u2014have a goal or standard to achieve wastewater discharge performance at \\na level beyond that required for regulatory compliance.

This dependence on water\\u2014both in the form of irrigation and precipitation, as well\\nas related water quality impacts\\u2014translates into potential risks for companies sourcing agricultural\\ninputs. Understanding the agricultural water management practices of farmers is critical for influencing\\nsustainable food production. Finding appropriate ways to invest in agricultural suppliers is essential:\\nmany agricultural producers do not have the financial resources or expertise to adequately address\\nwater and other sustainability risks without external support. \\nIn this water management category, companies were assessed on how they are evaluating, influencing\\nand supporting agricultural producers in their supply chains to better manage water risk and\\nimprove water-related practices. The packaged food industry outperformed all other industries \\nin this category (Exhibit 4.11). \\n30\\n25\\n20\\n15\\n10\\n5\\n0\\npo\\nin\\nts\\nExhibit 4.11: Agricultural Supply Chain Performance\\nBeverage Meatpackaged Food\\nMAxIMUM POINTS\\nMAxIMUM POINTS\\nAgricultural products\\nKey\\nMaximum \\u00ae\\nMinimum \\u00ae\\nMedian \\u00ae\\nSustainable Agriculture policies \\nOnly six companies overall (all in the packaged food and beverage industries) had a publicly-\\navailable policy or a set of explicit principles outlining expectations and aspirations for the\\nsustainability performance of agricultural producers (Exhibit 4.12).

PepsiCo\\u2019s\\nSustainable Agriculture Policy includes principles to \\u201cpreserve and maintain soil fertility, water \\nand air quality and biodiversity within the agricultural activities\\u201d and the objective to \\u201coptimize the\\napplied water footprint to crops and to reduce water waste during irrigation as well as responsibly\\nmanage runoff risks of pollution or contamination of ground or surface water with pesticides,\\nnutrients or soil.\\u201d6 Unilever\\u2019s Agricultural Code of Conduct is the most detailed and prescriptive,\\ndefining specific agricultural practices related to water use and water pollution mitigation it expects\\nfrom its suppliers, and outlining many practices as mandatory.7\\nCompanies with\\nSustainable\\nAgriculture policies\\n\\u2022 Coca-Cola Company\\n\\u2022 Kellogg\\n\\u2022 Molson Coors\\n\\u2022 nestl\\u00e9 \\n\\u2022 pepsiCo \\n\\u2022 Unilever\\nManufacturing \\nSupply Chain\\nTop Performers \\nTotal Points Available in \\nAgricultural Products \\n& Meat: \\n30/100\\nPackaged Food \\n& Beverage:\\n25/100\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 452\\nGoals for Sustainable Sourcing\\nForty-one percent (15) of companies evaluated have set a time-bound goal for sourcing at least\\none of their agricultural commodities more sustainably (Exhibit 4.12). These goals have varying\\nlevels of strength, with many focusing on only one commodity that makes up a relatively small\\npercentage of a company\\u2019s total procurement spend. Smithfield, for example, has a specific goal\\nrelated to the sustainability of the grain it sources to feed its hogs. By 2018, it seeks to \\u201chave 75 percent\\nof its Southeast [U.S.] grain-sourcing acres participate in a fertilizer optimization and soil health\\nprogram.\\u201d8 In 2015, the company plans to expand this goal to grain purchased in the U.S. Midwest.\\nConAgra and Hain Celestial are among a growing number of companies with time-bound goals to\\nsource 100 percent of their palm oil from certified sustainable sources. \\nOf the 15 companies with time-bound sourcing goals, only four\\u2014Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kellogg,\\nand Unilever\\u2014have goals that apply to the majority of their agricultural purchases. Kellogg and\\nGeneral Mills have committed to sourcing 100 percent of their 10 key agricultural inputs sustainably\\nby 2020. In these cases, the companies\\u2019 definition of \\u201csustainably\\u201d varies significantly by commodity,\\nbut for most ingredients, water efficiency and water quality are among the metrics used to benchmark\\nimprovement in farming practices.  \\nCollecting data from Agricultural producers\\n43 percent (16) of companies (most in the packaged food and beverage sectors) are collecting\\ndata on water management practices and performance from agricultural producers in their\\nsupply chains (Exhibit 4.12). For most companies, the data collected is often from a very narrow\\nsubset of their overall production base. \\nSome companies gather data from producers directly through audits. Nestl\\u00e9 conducts responsible\\nsourcing audits for tier 1 suppliers (which includes some agricultural producers) and requires all\\nother upstream suppliers to be in compliance with the company\\u2019s Responsible Sourcing Guidelines,\\na 20-page document that lays out detailed environmental and social requirements on 12 key\\ncommodities.9 Based on these audits, the company discloses that 17 percent of the volume of \\nits key commodities are currently responsibly sourced in accordance with Nestl\\u00e9\\u2019s guidelines. \\nNumerous companies are members of Field to Market, a multi-stakeholder initiative that is creating\\nenvironmental performance metrics for U.S. commodity crops. Growers participating in Field to\\nMarket are using the initiative\\u2019s \\u201cFieldprint Calculator\\u201d to collect data and monitor their water\\nmanagement practices. Kellogg and Bunge, together with the Nature Conservancy, are asking U.S.\\ncorn growers to use Field to Market metrics to monitor their on-farm practices. ADM, which supplies\\nsoybeans for Unilever\\u2019s Hellmann\\u2019s Mayonnaise, has enrolled soybean growers in Iowa to begin\\nreporting key environmental metrics, which are anonymously aggregated and shared with Unilever.10\\nExhibit 4.12: Policies and Programs to Improve Agricultural Suppliers\\u2019 Water Performance \\npolicy for Sustainable Agricultural Sourcing\\nTime-Bound Goals to Source Agricultural\\nInputs More Sustainably\\nGathers data from producers\\nprocures Commodities from Certified Sources\\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\\n\\u0005 = Agricultural products\\n\\u0005 = Beverage\\n\\u0005 = Meat\\n\\u0005 = packaged Food\\nPercent of Companies\\npurchasing Certi\\ufb01ed Commodities \\nA majority of companies (70 percent) source at least one agricultural commodity from certified\\nsources (Exhibit 4.12). Examples range from companies that are only sourcing certified sustainable\\npalm oil, which may make up less than one percent of their company\\u2019s procurement purchases, \\nto companies that are sourcing a range of certified commodities such as coffee, tea and chocolate\\nthat make up a much larger percentage of their overall procurement spend. Hain Celestial was \\nthe only company that sources certified inputs for more than 50 percent of its procurement spend\\n(60 percent of Hain Celestial\\u2019s products are certified organic).\\nIt is important to note that many agricultural certification programs do not comprehensively address\\nrelevant water risks and impacts. Some have much more in-depth requirements that take a range\\nof social and environmental factors into account, while others are much more limited in their scope.\\nGoing forward, water-focused efforts such as the Alliance for Water Stewardship\\u2019s new certification\\nstandard will likely be of growing relevance to agricultural certification.11\\nIncentivizing Agricultural producers \\nMany producers lack information, training or financial incentives that may be needed to adjust their\\nfarming practices in ways that reduce water risks and impacts. Producers may view adopting new\\nfarming practices that contribute to higher water efficiency or reduced impacts on water quality as \\na financially risky endeavor, due to real or perceived uncertainty about a practice\\u2019s effectiveness and\\nreturn on investment. Corporate buyers can play an important role\\u2014both directly and in partnership\\nwith supply chain partners, government, NGOs and academia\\u2014to channel appropriate educational\\nresources and financial incentives that help producers manage these risks and take on new practices.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 4 53\\nThe Complexities of Farm-level data Collection\\nAs companies seek to better evaluate water risks and identify ways to catalyze improvements in water management \\nat the farm level, data on the performance of agricultural producers is increasingly valuable. There can be significant\\nchallenges in gathering this data, however, due to traceability challenges in agricultural supply chains, as well as privacy\\nconcerns on the part of producers. Approaches to gathering this data vary\\u2014and include audits, surveys and anonymous\\nreporting through third-party databases\\u2014often depending on a company\\u2019s location in the value chain and the\\nnature of its relationships with producers. One major point of differentiation in data collection relates to whether\\nthe information gathered is focused on farming practices (e.g. no-till agriculture, use of drip irrigation) or on the\\nspecific environmental outcomes that these practices can lead to (e.g. improvements in soil health, reductions in\\ngroundwater withdrawals). The latter sort of information can be more useful for driving investment decision-making\\nand on-the-ground improvements, while the former can be easier to collect and validate. \\nCompanies and investors should consider the potential reporting burden from new data collection processes, particularly\\non growers with limited resources. They should carefully weigh the pros and cons of their data collection approach and\\ngauge whether there are ways to support growers in streamlining the data collection process through IT solutions, aligning\\nwith multi-stakeholder indicator efforts, and providing other forms of technical support. Additionally, data collection\\nshould not be viewed as a compliance or \\u201ctick-box\\u201d exercise, but should be used in ways that provide real value to\\nproducers, such as providing them with a benchmark of their performance against similar producers in their region.\\nFinally, farm-level data collection has limitations if indicators like water use are not considered in the context of\\nlocal watershed conditions. Highly efficient producers may use their water savings in one field to expand production\\nin another, potentially still depleting water sources. In addition, the water savings achieved by more efficient\\nfarmers can be easily overwhelmed by poor performance by neighboring farmers, thus failing to reduce overall \\nwater supply risk in a growing region.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 454\\nNearly half (18) of the companies evaluated provide some form of support to growers through\\neducation and training or financial incentives. Twelve companies reported providing direct\\neducational or agronomic resources to producers to encourage adoption of practices that reduce\\nimpacts on water. \\nUnilever directly engages with farmers in India, Turkey, China, Tanzania and Kenya to provide\\nguidance on a range of issues, including efficient use of drip irrigation and prudent pesticide use.\\nUnilever also \\u201cshare(s) our expertise on soil and irrigation management, water reuse and rainwater\\nharvesting techniques with our suppliers, so that they know what they can do to make improvements.\\nFor example, we know that applying irrigation only when crops need it and in the right amounts,\\nenhancing soil structure to increase its holding capacity and collecting water from rooftops and \\nrun-off can help farmers use water efficiently and can also help improve crop yields.\\u201d12\\nIn 2010, PepsiCo established its Sustainable Farming Initiative, a global program to help the\\ncompany measure the impacts of its agricultural supply chain against a range of environmental,\\nsocial and economic indicators, including soil moisture, water, management practices and\\nemployment conditions. The program provides support to oat, citrus, potato, rice and corn growers.\\nAs a part of this program, PepsiCo partnered with the UK\\u2019s Cambridge University to develop \\u201ci-crop,\\u201d\\na web-based platform to help PepsiCo growers monitor and manage water and carbon emissions\\nand improve crop yield and quality.13\\nEleven companies reported funding external programs and projects to help advance water\\nsustainability by farmers in their supply chains. Mondele\\u00afz, for example, is funding NGOs that\\nprovide tools and training to cocoa growers to strengthen agricultural management practices\\u2014\\nincluding limiting fertilizer and pesticide use and protecting water resources.\\nOnly a handful of companies\\u2014General Mills, Keurig, Unilever and WhiteWave\\u2014reported\\nproviding direct financial support to producers. Examples include premiums for more sustainably\\ngrown inputs; favorable financing terms or interest-free loans offered for equipment; and financial\\nguarantees. Unilever has established the Knorr Sustainability Partnership Fund that invests 50\\npercent in innovative projects that accelerate the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices.14\\nCompanies that\\nprovide Financial\\nIncentives to\\nGrowers for Better\\nWater Management\\n\\u2022 General Mills \\n\\u2022 Keurig Green\\nMountain\\n\\u2022 Unilever\\n\\u2022 WhiteWave Foods\\nCompany Recommendations  \\n1. Increase board oversight and understanding of material water risks. Corporate board members\\nhave a fiduciary duty for risk management oversight. While 43 percent (19) of the companies\\nevaluated in this report have board committees charged with environmental oversight, this oversight\\ndid not consistently translate into strong water management performance. Board charters should\\nbe strengthened to explicitly mention water. Additionally, board members should be regularly\\nbriefed by management on water-related risks, and provided with opportunities to engage with\\nexternal water experts.\\n2. Conduct robust water risk analysis. Many of the companies assessed in this report had relatively\\nweak systems\\u2014if any at all\\u2014for collecting and interpreting data on the severity of their exposure\\nto water risks. Companies should accelerate risk assessment, including analysis of their\\nmanufacturing and agricultural supply chains. When conducting water risk analysis, companies\\nshould bear in mind the various kinds of water risks to which they may be exposed (e.g. physical\\nscarcity risks and quality risks, regulatory risks, social license to operate risks), use forward-\\nlooking models or scenarios to identify the likelihood and severity of future risks, and use robust\\ndatasets to support this analysis (see Appendix D).\\n3. Address watershed-level risks. Most food sector companies are limiting their investments \\nin water risk mitigation to improving facility- or field-level water use efficiencies and meeting\\nregulatory compliance standards. While these efforts are important, even achieving best-in-class\\nwater use efficiency may not be sufficient to mitigate the physical, regulatory or reputational\\nrisks resulting from the broader mismanagement of local water resources. A narrow operational\\nfocus may also overlook lower-cost, higher-return opportunities to work collaboratively to reduce\\nrisk through activities that protect and restore watersheds. Companies should develop water risk\\nmitigation plans that incorporate targeted investments to improve the conditions of the most \\nat-risk watersheds on which their facilities and supply chains depend. Companies should also\\nconsider opportunities to align public policy positions and lobbying activities in ways that encourage\\ngovernment officials to implement more sustainable water management policies.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 5 55\\nRecommendations \\nfor Companies & Investors\\nGiven the growing materiality of water risks to the food sector, both investors and companies\\nmust act to mitigate short-term risks and foster long-term solutions that ensure sustainable \\nfood and water supplies.\\nCHApTER 5\\n4. Tackle water risks and impacts in agricultural supply chains. As water supplies are increasingly\\ndepleted and polluted in major agricultural regions across the world, traditional risk management\\napproaches such as hedging and geographic diversification are becoming less effective.\\nCompanies can achieve more by engaging directly with their supply chain to strengthen farmer\\npractices and protect the watersheds. Key strategies include setting sustainable agriculture\\npolicies and time-bound sourcing goals, purchasing certified sustainable commodities where\\nrelevant, and collecting data from farmers on their practices while providing assistance and\\nincentives for improvement.\\n5. Improve disclosure. Companies need to disclose to investors their exposure to water risk, as well as\\nstrategies and progress made in mitigating such risks. As much as possible, data should be reported\\nat the facility or regional level. Companies publicly-listed in the United States are required by the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to disclose to shareholders financially material risks\\nrelated to climate change and water in their operations and supply chains.1 Additionally, investors\\nexpect companies to provide more detailed disclosure of risks and mitigation strategies through\\ntheir corporate sustainability reports and in responses to CDP\\u2019s annual water information request.  \\nInvestor Recommendations\\n1. Analyze corporate water risk in terms of water dependence, security and response. When\\nevaluating a company\\u2019s overall risk, use the information and data resources suggested in this\\nreport to capture corporate water dependence (the amount of water needed for a company\\u2019s\\ndirect operations and supply chain, as well as the volumes and intensity of associated wastewater\\nthat must be assimilated by a receiving water body); the security of the water resources they \\nrely on; and the quality of management response to those risks.\\n2. Go beyond direct operations to consider supply chain water risks. While most companies \\nin the food sector are not directly involved in agricultural production, many are significantly\\nexposed to agricultural water risks through their suppliers. When analyzing water risks embedded\\nin agricultural supply chains, consider that risk exposure is shaped by several factors, including\\nthe primary agricultural commodities the company buys, the level of water dependence and\\nsecurity associated with those commodities, as well as the sourcing model used by the company\\nto procure agricultural inputs.  \\n3. Engage underperforming companies. Investors should engage portfolio companies on how they\\nmanage water risks. As a result of poor disclosure by many companies in the sector, investors need\\nto engage directly with corporate management to gather relevant information and encourage future\\ndisclosure. In addition to direct engagement, consider leveraging existing collaborative investor\\nefforts that engage companies on water, such as Ceres\\u2019 Investor Network, the United Nations-\\nsupported Principles for Responsible Investment\\u2019s (UNPRI) \\u201cWater Risks in Agricultural Supply\\nChains\\u201d group, and the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility\\u2019s (ICCR) Water & Food group.2\\n4. Integrate information from water risk analysis and corporate engagement into buy/sell\\ndecisions and beyond. Taking into account unique investor objectives, possible approaches\\ninclude embedding water analysis into overall environmental, social and governance scores;\\naltering the size of the investment universe to either avoid high water risk industries or companies,\\nor include companies with a strong management response; and embedding water risk analysis\\nin scenario analysis in financial models. Investors can conduct portfolio-level analysis of exposure to\\nhigh water risk regions, companies or agricultural activities. It is also beneficial to analyze cross-\\nasset class exposure, from equities and fixed income to commodities and farmland funds. For\\nother approaches and more details, see Ceres\\u2019 Investor Handbook for Water Risk Integration.3\\n5. Support efforts to increase and standardize food sector reporting on water. While some food\\nsector companies had robust disclosure, most did not, with some companies failing to report\\nbasic information on their water use and only 43 percent providing data to CDP\\u2019s 2014 water\\ninformation request. Investors should encourage company reporting to CDP, and also support\\nimprovements to the survey to ensure that more comparable, industry-relevant data is requested\\nfrom food sector companies. Investors may also wish to engage the Sustainability Accounting\\nStandards Board (SASB) on food sector water metrics.4\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter.556\\nMethodology  \\nCeres used a systematic method for evaluating and scoring the water risk management practices \\nof each of the 37 companies assessed. This methodology uses publicly available information and \\nis grounded in the Ceres Aqua Gauge,1 a framework that was developed in 2011 by Ceres, WBCSD,\\nIRRC and Irbaris in consultation with 50 investors, companies and NGOs. The Aqua Gauge was\\ndeveloped to aid investors in evaluating the water management activities of corporations in a range\\nof sectors against detailed definitions of leading practice. For the purpose of this analysis, these\\ndefinitions were modified to enhance their relevance to the unique water use characteristics of \\nthe food sector. \\nESG investment research firm Sustainalytics supported the analysis by leading the data collection\\nprocess, providing guidance on the methodology development, and synthesizing initial findings. \\nHow Companies Were Selected\\nThe 37 companies evaluated in this report fall within the food products and beverage industries, \\nas defined by the Global Industry Classification System (GICS).  \\nThe companies evaluated represented the largest packaged food, beverage, meat and agricultural\\nproducts firms listed in either the S&P 500 and/or the Russell 1000 indices as of July 2014. In\\naddition, a few large companies that are either listed on different indices or are privately held were\\nincluded in the analysis to provide a more comprehensive universe for benchmarking.    \\ndata Sources\\nFor each company, only publicly available information was used for the assessment. Any company\\ndisclosures made publicly available after November 15, 2014 were not included in this assessment. \\nThe following documents were reviewed:\\n\\u25cf Voluntary corporate disclosures such as sustainability or corporate social responsibility (CSR)\\nreports, press releases, and company websites.\\n\\u25cf Company responses to the CDP 2014 water information request.\\n\\u25cf In instances where companies did not receive or did not respond to the CDP 2014 water\\ninformation request, Sustainalytics also looked for relevant information reported to the CDP\\n2014 supply chain information request, the CDP 2014 climate change information request, \\nand in some cases CDP 2013 water information request. Documents reviewed corresponded to\\nthe most recent year available, which was fiscal year 2013 for most companies. In cases where\\ncompanies had issued water-specific reports or documents before 2013, these materials were\\nalso included in the review. \\n\\u25cf Mandatory financial disclosures such as 10-K filings and proxy statements. For non-U.S.\\ncompanies, the company\\u2019s annual report was reviewed in place of the 10-K.\\ndata Collection process & Quality Control\\nThere were multiple rounds of data collection and review. The first level of the data collection,\\nwhich included an internal review of all companies evaluated, was conducted by Sustainalytics\\nbetween November 3-15, 2014. Ceres conducted a second round of review and data collection\\nand made minor adjustments to the framework to ensure clarity and consistency in evaluation\\nacross industries. Sustainalytics incorporated this review into the assessment and completed\\nanother round of data collection for key indicators that had been adjusted. \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Appendix A 57\\nAppEndIx A\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Appendix A58\\nIn addition to conducting a final review of each company assessment, Ceres conducted a number\\nof quality assurance checks of key indicators across companies evaluated. Through these checks,\\nCeres was able to ensure that companies were evaluated and scored consistently within different\\nindicators and sub-indicators. \\nIndicators & Weights\\nCompany scores are based on the findings of 11 indicators and 44 sub-indicators that fall within\\nfour water management categories: governance & management, direct operations, manufacturing\\nsupply chain and agricultural supply chain (Exhibit A.2). One hundred points were allocated at the\\nsub-indicator level and roll up into total indicator scores, total water management category scores\\nand total overall company scores. \\nDue to differences in the operational structure of different industries, point allotments for indicators\\nand water management categories vary slightly by industry. Meat and agricultural products companies\\nare more likely to have direct contractual arrangements with agricultural producers or co-ops, and thus\\nhave a different level of influence with respect to their water management practices. As a result, more\\npoints were allocated to the agricultural supply chain category for these industries. Packaged food\\nand beverage companies are less likely to have direct relationships with agricultural producers, and\\nhave more ability to influence the water management practices of their manufacturing suppliers.\\nFor specific point allotments by industry, see Exhibit A.1. \\nWater Management Category\\nIndustries\\npackaged Food & Beverage Meat & Agricultural products\\nGovernance & Management 25% 25%\\ndirect Operations 30% 30%\\nManufacturing Supply Chain 20% 15%\\nAgricultural Supply Chain 25% 30%\\nExhibit A.1: Point Allotments by Industry\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Appendix A 59\\nGOvERnAnCE & MAnAGEMEnT\\npackaged\\nFood &\\nBeverage\\nMeat &\\nAgricultural\\nproducts\\nIndicator Scoring Guidance points\\n1: Charges board members and senior executives with oversight of water-related issues\\n1.1 Board Oversight\\nBoard committee has oversight over water-related issues (3 points),\\nAND/OR is regularly briefed by management on water-related issues\\n(3 points)\\nCompany\\u2019s board committee has a charter that references\\n\\u201cwater,\\u201d \\u201csustainability\\u201d or \\u201cenvironment.\\u201d\\n\\u201cRegularly briefed\\u201d means that the board is briefed by\\nmanagement on water issues at least once a year.\\n6 6\\n1.2 Senior Executive Oversight\\nThe individual with the highest level of direct responsibility for\\nwater-related issues reports directly to a member of the Executive\\nManagement Committee (3 points), OR the individual with the\\nhighest level of direct responsibility for water-related issues reports\\nto the CEO (6 points)\\n6 6\\n1.3 Executive Compensation\\nWater is linked to pay or incentive compensation for senior executives\\nWater is linked to pay (typically, bonus compensation) for senior\\nexecutives such as CEO, CFO, Chief Sustainability Officer, SVP\\nof Supply Chain.

One such tool, the Water Risk Filter2 developed by WWF\\nand DEG, tracks water risk exposure in the production of 120 crops and provides a Water Risk Score\\nfor each. Each score is specific to crop and production location.\\nTo illustrate the water risk inherent in the production end of agricultural supply chains, Water Risk\\nFilter data was requested for the top ten agricultural commodities most commonly sourced3 by the\\n37 companies examined in this report. These commodities were: almonds, cocoa, coffee, corn, grapes,\\npalm oil, soybean, sugarcane, tomatoes and wheat.4\\nThe physical water risk scores associated with each of these ten crops in the countries and river\\nbasins where they are produced are provided here. The Water Risk Filter calculates a physical water\\nrisk score using a weighted index of quantitative indicators related to water scarcity and groundwater\\ndepletion, water pollution, drought frequency and threats to biodiversity, among others.5, 6\\nCrop water risk is a function of regional water conditions and the physical water requirements and\\npollution impacts of the specific crop. Exhibit C.1 offers a global snapshot of how physical water risk\\nvaried on average among top crop-producing countries. Almonds, grapes, and tomatoes garnered\\n\\u201csome\\u201d to \\u201chigh\\u201d physical water risk in all four countries responsible for the majority of their production.\\nSugarcane and wheat production in India also garnered risk scores of 4 (\\u201chigh risk\\u201d) or greater.\\n*Production volumes reflect 5-year\\naverage production data (2007-\\n2011) provided by the UN\\u2019s Food\\nand Agricultural Organization (FAO)\\n**1: No or very limited risk, \\n2: limited risk, 3: some risk, \\n4: high risk, 5: very high risk\\n***Trends in global almond\\nproduction have shifted since this\\ndata was collected. According to FAO,\\nin 2013, Australia was the second\\nhighest producer of almonds,\\naccounting for 5.5% of global\\nproduction compared to an average\\n1.3% from 2007 to 2011. Conversely,\\nalmond production in Spain fell from\\nan average 10.2% to 5.1% by 2013.\\nIran and Italy currently rank fifth and\\neighth in global production volume\\nat 3.0% and 2.5%, respectively.\\nExhibit C.1: Water Risk Scores by Crop & Growing Region\\nExposure to physical water risk in agricultural production should also be assessed at the river\\nbasin level. Individual river basins, both within a given country and trans-boundary, contend with\\nvarying ecosystem threats and water uses that affect the physical water risk associated with crop\\nproduction. Physical water risks can also vary within river basins: downstream water availability and\\nquality depend in part on upstream water use, for example. However, gauging the overall water risk\\nof crop production in a given basin can be a useful start to addressing risk exposure and management\\nin agricultural supply chains.\\nNearly 20 percent in the 311 river basins captured in the Water Risk Filter analysis of our crops of\\ninterest were production locations with high physical water risk scores (4 or higher). These river\\nbasins were located across six continents and included production of all ten of our crops of interest.\\nEight of these 59 basins were production sites for five or more high-risk crops (Exhibit C.2).\\nAll but two of these basins were trans-boundary.\\nCrops with physical risk scores exceeding 4.5, indicating the highest level of risk, were produced\\nin just eight river basins (Exhibit C.3). These crops included wheat, tomatoes, grapes, cocoa,\\ncorn and soybeans. The Yongding, Bravo and Chelif river basins were associated with production \\nof several highest-risk crops, with tomato production captured in all three basins. The highest-risk\\nproduction of cocoa was concentrated in Peru\\u2019s Oco\\u00f1a, Majes and Santa River Basins.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Appendix C66\\nBasin Country Crop physical Water Risk Score\\nyongding China\\nWheat 4.793\\nTomatoes 4.629\\nCorn 4.565\\nSoybean 4.553\\nBravo\\nMexico, \\nUnited States\\nTomatoes 4.768\\nGrapes 4.746\\nChelif Algeria\\nTomatoes 4.524\\nGrapes 4.502\\nOco\\u00f1a peru Cocoa 4.614\\nMajes peru Cocoa 4.550\\nSanta peru Cocoa 4.550\\nLuan China Wheat 4.508\\nChira Ecuador, peru Tomatoes 4.501\\nBasin Country\\nnumber of\\nHigh Risk\\nCrops\\nChira Ecuador, peru 7\\nBravo Mexico, United States 6\\nSan Joaquin United States (CA) 5\\nSalinas United States (CA) 5\\nyongding China 5\\nGuadiana portugal, Spain 5\\nLimpopo\\nSouth Africa,\\nBotswana, Zimbabwe,\\nMozambique\\n5\\nLimari Chile 5\\nExhibit C.2: River Basins with \\nFive or More High Risk* Crops\\nExhibit C.3: The Highest Risk Crops were \\nProduced in 8 River Basins\\n*Indicates a physical water risk score greater than 4\\non a 1-5 scale.\\nAdditional Resources\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Appendix D 67\\nAppEndIx d\\nOrganization Tool or Resource Website\\nAlliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) AWS Certification Standard www.allianceforwaterstewardship.org\\nBloomberg BMAP Water Stress Overlay Bloomberg Terminal\\nCDP CDP Water Information Request www.cdp.net/water\\nCEO Water Mandate CEO Water Mandate Corporate Disclosure Guidelines www.ceowatermandate.org/disclosure\\nCeres Ceres Aqua Gauge Water Risk Management Tool www.ceres.org/aquagauge\\nCeres SEC Climate & Water Disclosure Search Tool http://www.ceres.org/resources/tools/sec-climate-disclosure\\nCeres An Investor Handbook on Water Risk Integration www.ceres.org/investorwaterhandbook\\nGEMI GEMI Local Water Tool http://www.gemi.org/localwatertool\\nMaplecroft Maplecroft Global Water Security Risk Index www.maplecroft.com/about/news/water-security.html\\nNational Integrated Drought \\nInformation System U.S. Drought Monitor www.drought.gov\\nTrucost Water Risk Monetizer www.waterriskmonetizer.com\\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) EPA Toxics Release Inventory Program www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program\\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online echo.epa.gov\\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Nitrogen and Phosphorus Pollution Data Access Tool www2.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/nitrogen-and-phosphorus-pollution-data-access-tool\\nWater Footprint Network Water Footprint Network\\u2019s Assessment Tool waterfootprint.org/en/resources/interactive-tools/water-footprint-assessment-tool\\nWater Footprint Network WaterStat (water footprint statistics) waterfootprint.org/en/resources/water-footprint-statistics\\nWorld Business Council \\nfor Sustainable Development Global Water Tool www.wbcsd.org\\nWorld Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas www.wri.org/aqueduct\\nWorldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter waterriskfilter.panda.org\\nWater Risk Tools & datasets\\nAgriculture-Related Tools & datasets\\nOrganization Tool or Resource Website\\nCeres Climate & Water Risks Facing U.S. Corn Production www.ceres.org/cornmaps\\nField to Market: \\nThe Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture Fieldprint Calculator www.fieldtomarket.org/fieldprint-calculator\\nInnovation Center for U.S. Dairy Farm Smart Tool sites.usdairy.com/farmsmart/Pages/Home.aspx\\nThe Stewardship Index for Specialty Crops Specialty Crop Sustainability Metrics www.stewardshipindex.org\\nSustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI)\\nPlatform SAI Platform www.saiplatform.org\\nU.S. Department of Agriculture Farm & Ranch Irrigation Survey www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Online_Resources/Farm_and_Ranch_Irrigation_Survey\\nUN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) FAOSTAT & AQUASTAT faostat3.fao.org &www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Endnotes68\\nExecutive Summary\\n1      \\u201cGlobal Risks 2015 10th Edition,\\u201d\\u00a0World Economic Forum, page 20, World Economic\\nForum, Geneva, 2015,\\nhttp://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risks_2015_Report15.pdf\\n2      World Resources Institute, WRI Aqueduct, \\u201cAgricultural Exposure to Water Stress,\\u201d\\nhttp://www.wri.org/applications/maps/agriculturemap/#x=0.00&y=-\\n0.00&l=2&v=home&d=gmia\\n3      Elmquist, Sonja, \\u201cCargill Earnings Decline on Effects of Rail and Drought,\\u201d Bloomberg\\nBusiness, 7 August, 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-07/cargill-\\nearnings-decline-on-effects-of-drought-railcar-shortage\\n4      Giammona, Craig. \\u201cCampbell Soup Struggles With Role as Carrot Farmer Amid Drought.\\u201d\\nBloomberg Business.

Compared to scarcity, water stress is a more\\ninclusive and broader concept. It considers several physical aspects related to water\\nresources, including water availability, water quality, and the accessibility of water (i.e.,\\nwhether people are able to make use of physically available water supplies), which is often a\\nfunction of the sufficiency of infrastructure and the affordability of water, among other things.\\nBoth water consumption and water withdrawals provide useful information that offers insight\\ninto relative water stress. There are a variety of physical pressures related to water, such as\\nflooding and drought, that are not included in the notion of water stress. Water stress has\\nsubjective elements and is assessed differently depending on societal values. For example,\\nsocieties may have different thresholds for what constitutes sufficiently clean drinking water\\nor the appropriate level of environmental water requirements to be afforded to freshwater\\necosystems, and thus assess stress differently.\\u201d\\n5      UN-Water, Coping with Water Scarcity-A Strategic Issue and Priority for System-Wide Action,\\nAugust 2006,\\nhttp://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/2006_unwater_coping_with_water_scarcity_eng.pdf\\n6      Wada, Beek, Bierkens, \\u201cNonsustainable Groundwater Sustaining Irrigation: A Global\\nAssessment,\\u201d Water Resources Research, Vol. 48, January, 25, 2012,\\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011WR010562/pdf\\n7      FAO Aquastat, Water Withdrawal by World Sector, Around 2006, last updated 2015,\\nhttp://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_use/index.stm\\n8      Water Footprint Product Gallery, Water footprint Network,\\nhttp://www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/productgallery\\n9      Information Office of the State Council, People\\u2019s Republic of China, \\u201c1st National Census \\non Pollution Sources Completed,\\u201d 2 Feb. 2010, http://www.china.org.cn/china/2010-\\n02/09/content_19394384.htm\\n10    Jonathan Ansfield and Keith Bradsher, \\u201cChina Report Shows More Pollution in Waterways, \\u201c\\nNew York Times, 9 Feb. 2010,\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/world/asia/10pollute.html\\n11    Elmquist, Sonja, \\u201cCargill Earnings Decline on Effects of Rail and Drought,\\u201d Bloomberg\\nBusiness, 7 August, 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-07/cargill-\\nearnings-decline-on-effects-of-drought-railcar-shortage\\n12    Giammona, Craig. \\u201cCampbell Soup Struggles With Role as Carrot Farmer Amid Drought.\\u201d\\nBloomberg Business.

IntroductionThe State of Global Islamic Economy Report (SGIE) states that in 2019 the number of the world\\u2019s Muslim community reached around 1.9 billion people, with total spending on halal products reaching USD 2.02 trillion. This fi gure is projected to continue to increase in line with the increasing number of the world\\u2019s Muslim community and is estimated to reach USD 2.4 trillion in 2024. In addition, based on the same report, Indonesia\\u2019s Islamic economic indicators in 2020 managed to rank 4th in the world behind Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Six halal industry clusters were assessed: halal food and beverages, Muslim fashion, halal pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, halal media and recreation, halal tourism and the Islamic economy. Based on these sharia economic indicators, Indonesia\\u2019s economic and sharia position is, on average, in the top 10. Two of them have made it into the top fi ve in the world, namely the halal food and beverage sector and the Muslim fashion or clothing sector.The Indonesian government has determined to make Indonesia the centre of the world\\u2019s sharia economy by 2024. Therefore, the Master Plan for the Indonesian Sharia Economy (MEKSI) was established in 2019, which is a road map for developing the sharia economy, which aims to strengthen the national economy. In 2020, the master plan was revealed to be the Implementation Plan and Work Plan 2020-2024 based on solid coordination between the stakeholders of the National Sharia Economic and Finance Committee (KNEKS) from the government, academia, industry players, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), and the community. The plan consists of 30 strategic programs focusing on developing and strengthening the halal industry, Islamic fi nance and social fi nance, and sharia business and entrepreneurship.Apart from the target to become the centre of the world\\u2019s sharia economy by 2024, the impetus for the development of the halal industry also comes from Law Number 33 of 2014 concerning Halal Product Assurance and Government Regulation Number 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Assurance Sector. This regulation requires that all food and beverage products circulating in Indonesia be certifi ed halal, except for those declared haram by religion. The phasing period of halal certifi cation for food and beverages starts from October 17, 2019, to October 17, 2024. Violation of this regulation may result in food and beverage products not being marketed in Indonesia.Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) face various obstacles in fulfi lling their halal certifi cation obligations. Some of the obstacles commonly faced include low awareness to comply with applicable regulations, lack of knowledge about applicable regulations, lack of human resources, and limited funds to invest and make various improvements required by regulations. On the other hand, the business run by MSMEs has an essential role in supporting the nation\\u2019s economy and providing employment opportunities for the community. Muhammad et al. Halal Studies and Society  Vol x No. X  (2024) : x -x 2for handling critical activities (training for all personnel, use and purchase of materials, production methods, storage of materials and products, transportation of materials and products, washing facilities and product presentation methods) as well as evaluating the implementation of HAS in the form of internal audits and management reviews. Dakara Coffee must develop a simple and easy-to-follow HAS Manual because it will be used as a technical guide for HAS implementation. In addition, Dakara Coffee needs to conduct a business analysis to objectively determine its business development strategy based on internal conditions (strengths and weaknesses) and external conditions (opportunities and challenges).Based on the problems above, the objectives of this research are as follows. First, compiling and implementing the guidelines in the manual for the halal assurance system for MSME and identifying the parts that have not been appropriately implemented. Second, formulate recommendations for improvements that need to be made by MSME so that they can implement the halal assurance system manual in their entirety and are ready to carry out halal certification. Third, formulate a halal certification-based MSME business development strategy using the Analytical Hierarchy Process approach.The scope of this research is to prepare all the requirements Dakara Coffee needs to register its products and business entities through BPJPH to be certified by LPPOM MUI. The scope of documents that must be prepared is the Halal Assurance System Manual (SJH Manual). The manual contains many components and is one of the requirements in the registration process so that business owners get other documents such as a Document Receipt Letter (STTD), a Halal Decree (KH), and finally, a Halal Certificate as proof that the product and the business entity have been certified. The data used are primary data obtained from observations and interviews with the management team and employees of Dakara Coffee.2.  Methodology This research was conducted in September \\u2013 December 2021 at Dakara Coffee. Dakara Coffee is located at Dramaga \\u2013 Laladon New Ring Road Number 9 IPB, Dramaga, Bogor. Data collection methods were carried out through direct observation and interviews with the person in charge and employees at Dakara Coffee to obtain primary data. The primary data in this study include the state of the restaurant, list of ingredients, menu list, restaurant layout, restaurant management structure, types of products, work procedures or procedures, as well as opinions from Dakara Coffee and other respondents regarding business development. The collected data is then used to compile the HAS manual. Business process identification is also conducted to obtain the data needed to prepare the HAS manual. This identification is an activity of observing the activities that take place during the operation of the business. This identification process is divided into production preparation, production process, and post-production.Manual of halal assurance system concerning MUI halal requirements (HAS 23000). The preparation of the HAS manual aims to produce guidelines as outputs needed by business actors to register their products and business entities with BPJPH for halal certification needs. It should be underlined that debriefing and training are needed to compile a manual for the halal assurance system as a basis for processing and collecting data as a whole (training will be held on September 21, 2021).Implementation is done by applying the HAS manual designed for routine business activities at Dakara Coffee. The Based on data from the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises (Kemenkop UKM) in March 2021, the number of MSME actors in Indonesia reached 64.2 million, contributing to the gross domestic product (GDP) of 61.07%. The existence of MSMEs can absorb 97% of the total workforce and can collect up to 60.42% of the total investment in Indonesia. Around 70% of the MSMEs produce food and beverages (Tambunan, 2021).Various mentoring programs for MSMEs are essential to ensure the sustainability of MSMEs\\u2019 businesses in terms of fulfilling halal certification obligations following the time target set in PP No. 39 of 2021. The mentoring program can be in the form of technical guidance to prepare competent human resources and all required documents or permits. To register for halal certification and facilities in the form of funding for the halal certification registration process, which includes the management of NIB (Business Identification Number) at BKPM/Ministry of Investment, processing of the Document Receipt Letter (STTD) from the Halal Product Guarantee Agency (BPJPH) of the Ministry of Religion and registration certification to the Halal Inspection Agency (LPH). Various government agencies and private companies have carried out mentoring programs; their scope is minimal compared to the number of MSMEs that need it. In 2021, BPJPH can only provide certification facilitation for MSMEs as many as 2553 through the Sehati21 Program and 1253 through the self-declared route. In 2022, BPJPH will provide a free halal certification program for 10 million MSME products. Therefore, MSMEs assistance efforts must continue to be improved so that its coverage can meet the needs of MSMEs, especially MSMEs with food and beverage products, whose number is more than 40 million.Dakara Coffee is a coffee shop located at Dramaga-Laladon New Ring Road Number 9 Dramaga, Bogor. It is one of the cafes that offer food and beverage products for its customers. Apart from its location close to the Dramaga IPB Campus and its affordable menu prices, Dakara Coffee provides facilities generally favoured by students or the younger generation, such as free internet access networks, attractive decorations for photo shoots, outdoor facilities, and the availability of working space. Dakara Coffee is interesting to be chosen as a research focus as it is categorised as a small business that serves food and beverages, so it must be ready for halal certification under government targets. In addition, Dakara Coffee serves a very diverse menu which, of course, requires various types of ingredients with different specifications. This evidence creates complexity in collecting supporting documents for the materials required in the halal certification criteria.With the enactment of Law No. 33/2014 and PP No. 39/2021, food and beverage products circulated in Indonesia must be certified halal with a preparation period from October 17, 2019, to October 17, 2024. Food and beverage products that have not been certified halal after October 17, 2024, threatened with sanctions should not be marketed. Thus, Dakara Coffee needs to immediately make preparations for halal certification to meet regulatory requirements and continue to operate.Regarding halal certification, Dakara Coffee owners and employees must understand the applicable certification procedures and criteria and prepare the necessary documents. Therefore, technical guidance is needed to prepare all the requirements for a halal certificate. Referring to the procedures and criteria of HAS 23 000, the Halal Assurance System Manual (SJH) is needed to be prepared. The HAS Manual contains an overview of how to fulfil the HAS 23000 criteria, which includes a halal policy statement, determination of the Halal Management Team, an explanation of written procedures 3Muhammad et al.

All weighting done by respondents through the AHP questionnaire will be processed using Microsoft Excel 2019 software. Combining the weights between respondents will show the importance of the factors that will be the top priority to the final priority based on the order of the largest to the smallest values.Table 1.

Nusantara Catering Success & Liliwetan Restaurant Business OwnerSJP Head of Quality Assurance/Quality Control Flash Coffee Indonesia (PT. Ninety Six Degrees)Sampling designThe respondents were selected using the purposive sampling method. The purposive sampling method is based on specific criteria in a study (Sekaran and Bougie 2016). The respondent criteria used in this study are the decision makers or management of Dakara Coffe and those in the food and beverage business. They have conducted training and education programs for halal certification for business continuity.3.. Results and Discussion Dakara Coffee is a coffee shop located in Bogor, with various processed chicken, beef, and fish menus. Dakara Coffee also provides a variety of beverages, such as coffee, juice, and traditional spice blends. Dakara Coffee is located at Dramaga-Laladon New Ring Road No.9 IPB, Dramaga, Bogor. Currently, Dakara Coffee is led by Kiman Siregar, who is also the owner of the cafe. At the cafe, 15 employees work as cooks, waiters, and baristas.Dakara Coffee is one of the leading choices for students and people with urban lifestyles because it has various variants of food and drinks menus, desirable facilities (availability of WiFi internet network, attractive decorations for photoshoots, outdoor facilities, working space) and affordable prices for students. In practice, Dakara Coffee carries out business activities, such as purchasing raw materials, storing materials, checking and washing ingredients, compounding menus, production, washing facilities, and making food and beverages. Purchases of raw materials are generally carried out every week. Most of these raw materials are stored in refrigerators and freezers to avoid damage to materials more quickly.3.1  Halal Assurance System Manual and Its ImplementationThe Halal Assurance System (HAS) is a system that is designed, applied, and maintained with the function of regulating so that materials, production processes, products, human resources, and procedures can always comply with the criteria in the MUI halal certification requirements (HAS 23000) (LPPOM MUI 2008 ). The Halal Assurance System Manual (SJH Manual) is a written guide compiled for restaurants to fulfilment of the requirements is formed in the form of a written document that will be used as a reference for restaurants in the production process. All activities carried out by Dakara Coffee will refer to the written document of the HAS manual. At the end of implementation, analysis and evaluation will be carried out.2.1 Analytical Hierarchy ProcessThe Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a decision support model describing a complex multi-factor or multi-criteria problem into a hierarchy. Hierarchy is defined as a representation of a complex problem in a multi-level structure. The first level is the goal, followed by factors, criteria, and sub-criteria until the last level is an alternative (Saaty, 1993). Through the hierarchy, a complex problem can be broken down into groups which are then arranged into a hierarchical form so that the problem will appear more structured and systematic.The AHP method is based on three main principles and axioms. The basic principles are as follows (Suryadi and Ramdhani, 1998):1. Decomposition. Through this principle, the structure of a complex problem is divided into parts hierarchically. Goals are defined from general to specific. The structure will be compared at objectives, criteria, and alternative levels in its simplest form. Each alternative set allows it to be divided into more detailed levels, covering other criteria. The top level is a goal consisting of one element.2. Comparative judgments, with this principle, pairwise comparisons of all existing elements will be built to produce a scale of the relative importance of the elements. The assessment produces a rating scale in the form of numbers. If combined, pairwise comparisons in the form of a matrix will produce priority.3. Priority synthesis is performed by multiplying the local priorities of the relevant criteria at the top level and adding them to each element in the level affected by the criteria. The results are combined or known as global priorities, which are then used to weight local priorities from the lowest level according to the criteria.There are three stages in the AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) analysis method. These stages are as follows:1. Create a hierarchical structure from an overall managerial point of view to make a pairwise comparison between the factors that play an essential role in the development of Dakara Coffee\\u2019s business. The hierarchy is arranged based on a literature review.2. Make a pairwise comparison matrix between factors to describe the relative contribution of each element to each goal at the level above. The comparison is determined based on the choice of the decision maker or the management of Dakara Coffe and the parties involved in the food and beverage business. Comparison assesses the importance of an element compared to other elements. A scale of 1 will be used until all qualitative and quantitative criteria are calculated to produce weights and priorities; then, the weighting will be carried out by expert sources using the pairwise comparison method.3. Evaluate logical consistency across all hierarchies. Expert informants\\u2019 opinions were analysed with a consistency ratio with a maximum value of 10 per cent. Shaliha (2017) said the Consistency Ratio is an indicator parameter to see whether pairwise comparisons are consistent; if the CR value is below 10 per cent, then the priority scale can Muhammad et al. Halal Studies and Society  Vol x No. X  (2024) : x -x 4Based on observations of all the facilities used by Dakara Coffee which include material preparation, compounding and cooking facilities, beverage preparation, menu presentation facilities, washing facilities and material warehouses, it can be concluded that the Dakara Coffee facilities have met the SJH criteria because no use of pork-derived materials has been found so that the facility meets the criteria. Washing is done with water and liquid soap, equipped with a halal certificate. The adequacy of the washing results is measured by the loss of odours and the cleanliness of the equipment from residual products and materials.Written procedures for purchasing materials have been developed. This procedure ensures that purchases are made only of the specified materials. Because Dakara Coffee is still in the preparation stage for certification, the purchase reference is a brief ingredient list. If Dakara Coffee has been certified, this ingredient list can be downloaded from the CEROL online system. This list of ingredients will become approved by LPPOM MUI and become a reference for purchasing and cooking. The available materials are the result of observations and research data collection.Internal audit implementation procedures have been developed. This procedure regulates the implementation of internal audits, which are scheduled at least once a year. A checklist for implementing the internal audit has been prepared following Dakara Coffee\\u2019s business activities with 11 HAS criteria. An internal audit was conducted on November 8, 2021. There are several weaknesses in implementing the HAS, namely the presence of materials not equipped with supporting documents for materials that meet the criteria, and there are 2 beverage products that use the name beer. Based on the explanation from the halal management team, all audit findings will be resolved immediately before registering for halal certification.Management review procedures have been developed; these reviews are scheduled at least once a year. The management review was carried out on the same day as the internal audit. This review discussed the internal audit results and planned corrective actions to resolve the weaknesses found.3.2 Essential Factors in Dakara Coffee Business DevelopmentThe final analysis stage in this research is to process the essential factors in Dakara Coffee\\u2019s business development. The results of this study look at the role of the halal assurance system or halal management as an essential factor in the development of the Dakara Coffee business. The AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method is used to determine the weight of each factor to obtain a priority ranking.Main Factor ComparisonThe critical factors in developing the Dakara Coffee business that has been compiled are organisational management, halal management, branding strategy, location, and product innovation. The weighting will be given using the pairwise comparison method between one factor and another to see the level of importance. The weight of each factor can be seen in Table 4.produce halal products composed of the requirements of the MUI halal certificate (HAS 23000) issued by the MUI.Identification is carried out in the preparation of the HAS manual at Dakara Coffee. Identification is the first step in preparing the halal assurance system manual so the guide can follow the cafe situation. This study identifies several requirements for the halal assurance system that Dakara Coffee has not fully implemented. Fulfilment of the requirements that must be met includes 11 criteria, namely halal policy, halal management team, training, materials, products, facilities, critical activities, traceability, handling products that do not meet the criteria, internal audits, and management reviews. After completing the identification, the manual preparation of the halal assurance system can be carried out. Then, the HAS manual was implemented, and improvements were made following the provisions of the guide.Dakara Coffee\\u2019s halal policies are as follows: Dakara Coffee is committed to consistently producing and offering halal and safe products for consumption following the MUI halal certificate (HAS 23000) requirements and Government Regulation No. 28 of 2004 concerning Food Safety for Restaurants and Restaurants. This commitment is achieved by using only materials that meet the criteria, ensuring pig and unclean-free facilities, providing training for all employees and implementing them. The training activity was carried out on September 21, 2021.The owner of Dakara Coffee has appointed the halal management team through a letter of appointment. This team consists of a team leader, employees from the purchasing and receiving of materials, the cooking section, the compounding and serving section, and the washing section. The entire halal management team is a permanent team member of Dakara Coffee. Each team member\\u2019s duties in implementing HAS have also been described and linked to daily tasks.Implementation of internal and external training has been prepared. Internal training is scheduled at least once a year, while external training is at least once every two years. The material from the training was about halal regulations, and the 11 HAS criteria. Internal and external training will be held on September 21, 2021, and evidence of implementation is available as a training certificate.All ingredients used in Dakara Coffee have been identified, and supporting documents have been collected. So far, Dakara Coffee has not asked suppliers for supporting material documents. The collection of supporting documents is done by searching the LPPOM MUI website (www.halalmui.org). Based on this search, halal certificate documents were obtained from most of the ingredients used by Dakara Coffee. The search was also carried out by looking at the list of non-critical materials (positive list) published by LPPOM MUI. Non-critical materials are materials that have been verified as halal sources.After identifying the ingredients used by Dakara Coffee and tracing the supporting documents, it was found that several food ingredients were not equipped with documents and the suppliers were also unable to provide information on the ingredients used, namely meatballs, vermicelli, chicken and beef, dim sum, wet noodles, nuggets, sausage, and processed suki-suki. In beverage products, ingredients are not accompanied by supporting documents, namely boba. It was also found that materials not equipped with a halal certificate did not meet the product criteria for certification, namely King Coffee Beer and Ngoro Coffee Beer. This beverage product is a carbonated (soda) coffee drink. The two products do not meet the requirements to be certified halal because they use the word \\u201cbeer\\u201d, whereas, in the HAS 23000 criteria, all materials to be certified must not contain haram and unclean elements.5Muhammad et al. Halal Studies and Society  Vol x No. X  (2024) : x -x Table 4. Results of pairwise comparisons of product innovation factor groupsFactor Weight Priority CRPrice 0.597 1 0.0002Uniqueness 0.143 3Taste 0.259 2Source: own estimation (2022)In product innovation, respondents chose price as the top priority factor with a weight of 0.597, uniqueness as the second priority with a weight of 0.259, and taste with a weight of 0.143. The CR in this analysis is 0.0002 or below 0.1, indicating that the respondent\\u2019s weighting meets the pairwise comparison requirements. Therefore, the management can implement this priority scale as a basis for product development.3.5 Suggestions for Improvement of HAS ImplementationReferring to the results of the identification and implementation of the HAS manual at Dakara Coffee, several aspects are not following the requirements of the MUI halal certificate (HAS 23000). The discrepancy is found in aspects of supporting documents for materials and product names. Materials used in business processes must be accompanied by supporting documents, especially critical materials such as chicken, beef, and processed derivatives. Because there are materials that are not equipped with supporting documents, it is necessary to hold an audit of producers and suppliers to ensure their halal status. Several supporting and auxiliary materials were also found that already have a halal certificate but are almost entering their expiration date.The names and products used and offered to consumers must be free from haram and unclean elements. Based on the identification carried out, product names come from brands with haram and unclean elements (beer/khamr). Although the product has its consumer scope, in the process, implementation, and application of halal certification, it is not allowed for business actors to sell, distribute, and offer products both in terms of name and ingredients with elements containing haram and unclean substances. Due to this, the researcher proposes several alternatives so that Dakara Coffee can implement the HAS manual properly. These alternatives include changing names and materials used in business processes and recommending materials in the form of a list (list) that has been certified halal by MUI as an option in the Dakara Coffee business process.4. Conclusion and RecommendationThe halal assurance system manual was designed to be a written guide for restaurants on the requirements of the MUI halal certificate (HAS 23000). The manual preparation of the halal assurance system can make it easier for restaurants to meet the requirements set by LPPOM MUI.At the implementation stage, Dakara Coffee has not yet fully implemented a halal assurance system in its business activities. Two of the eleven criteria contained in the manual for the halal assurance system have not been fully met, namely the criteria for materials and products. There are still brands of materials and products that are not following the halal provisions of LPPOM MUI (HAS 23000), where it is forbidden to sell products that contain elements of haram and unclean substances with various scopes, both name, taste, and aroma. This discrepancy motivates Dakara Coffee to have several Table 2. The results of the pairwise comparison of the main factor groupsFactor Weight Priority CROrganisational Management0.128 5 0.097Halal Management 0.167 2Branding Strategy 0.161 3Location 0.389 1Product Innovation 0.155 4Source: Primary Data 2022Table 2 shows that respondents chose the location factor as the top priority factor with a weight of 0.389. Then the halal management factor was the second priority with a weight of 0.167, followed by the branding strategy factor with a weight of 0.161, product innovation with a weight of 0.155 and finally, the organisational management factor with a weight of 0.128. The Consistency Ratio (CR) is 0.097 or below 0.1, indicating that respondents\\u2019 weighting meets the requirements for pairwise comparisons. Halal management as a second priority shows that the halal assurance system\\u2019s role is essential in developing a better business.3.3 Comparison of Halal Management FactorsSeveral important factors are considered criteria or sub-factors essential to their implementation. Factors in halal management are compiled based on the halal assurance system manual. These factors are menu and materials, commitment, and training and education. The weight of each factor can be seen in Table 5.Table 3. Results of pairwise comparisons of halal management Factor Weight Priority CRMenu and Ingre-dients0.725 1 0.254Commitment 0.200 2Training and Education0.074 3Source: own estimation (2022)In halal management, respondents chose menu and ingredients as the top priority factor with a weight of 0.725, then commitment as the second priority with a weight of 0.200, and finally training and education with a weight of 0.074. The CR in this analysis is 0.254, which indicates that the weighting by the respondents does not meet the pairwise comparison requirements because it is above 0.1. The halal assurance system cannot be seen from one element alone. Each factor or element in the halal assurance system manual is equally essential to decide whether a product is halal or not.3.4 Product Innovation Factor ComparisonProduct innovation is often an essential factor in the development of a business. However, this study only occupies the fourth position of the level of importance or priority factor. However, the essential element in the product innovation factor remains interesting. Factors in product innovation are price, uniqueness, and taste. The weight of each factor can be seen in Table 6.Muhammad et al. Halal Studies and Society  Vol x No. X  (2024) : x -x 6Arief DK. 2021.

In addition to these discrepancies, some materials (including critical materials) have not been accompanied by complete documents, so further audits are needed on the supplier side. This study recommends similar materials accompanied by an MUI halal certificate as an alternative. However, all business decisions fall back on the team and owners of Dakara Coffee.The main priority factors generated through AHP analysis in the development of Dakara Coffee\\u2019s business are location as the top priority factor, followed by halal management, branding strategy, product innovation, and organisational management. Halal management as a second priority shows that the halal assurance system\\u2019s role is essential in developing a better business. There is also a priority scale of essential elements in several factors. In halal management, the importance of each factor sequentially is menu and ingredients, commitment, and training and education. However, the consistency ratio value in halal management does not meet the requirements, so no absolute conclusions can be drawn. In product innovation, the importance of each factor sequentially is price, uniqueness, and taste.This study suggests that MSMEs, including Dakara Coffee, should immediately make improvements to the criteria that have not been fully met with the proposals and recommendations that have been made so that the manual for the halal assurance system can be fully complied with and can immediately enter the halal certification stage. Applying the official regulations and protecting the consumer against the halal status of the products consumed is essential. It is suggested that business actors, especially the owners and the halal management team of Dakara Coffee, can fulfil their responsibilities in the scope of business activities at Dakara Coffee and as suppliers of raw materials.5.

The college\\u2019s enrolment andinduction procedures were inspected at the beginning of the autumn term1995, specialist subject areas in March, April and May 1995, and aspectsof cross-college provision from 9 to 12 October 1995.  Ten inspectors spenta total of 53 days in the college.  They observed 101 classes involving 1,167students, examined representative samples of students\\u2019 work, and helddiscussions with governors, college staff, students, local employers, arepresentative of the Birmingham Training and Enterprise Council (TEC),parents, teachers from local schools and representatives of the localcommunity.  THE COLLEGE AND ITS AIMS2 Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies is aspecialist provider of education, training and services to the hospitality andrelated service industries.  The college, whose origins can be traced back tothe late nineteenth century, serves local, regional, national and internationalcommunities.  It has occupied its present site in the centre of Birminghamsince 1967 and this central location enables thousands of members of thegeneral public to use its shops, restaurants and other client services eachyear, providing students with a broad range of experience.  The hospitalityindustry is an international one and the college reflects this in its dealingswith industry, students, other education providers and the public.3 There are seven other further education colleges and four sixth formcolleges within the Birmingham conurbation and at least 15 furthereducation colleges within reasonable travelling distance of the city centre.The college has few local competitors in its further education hospitalitywork and although many other West Midlands colleges compete with it fortourism, caring, hairdressing and beauty therapy students, it has increasedits student numbers each year since the mid-1980s.  In recent years therehas been a particularly marked increase in higher education enrolments,especially in tourism and leisure.  The college has the highest proportionof higher education students of any further education college in Englandand Wales and receives more than 65 per cent of its funding from sourcesother than the Further Education Funding Council (FEFC).  It offers a rangeof courses that enables students to progress from foundation topostgraduate level.4 At the time of the inspection, the college had 3,052 FEFC-fundedenrolments, of which 1,757 were full time.  Forty-nine per cent of thestudents were over 19 years of age.  FEFC-funded enrolments by age, bylevel of study and by mode of attendance and curriculum area are shownin figures 1, 2 and 3, respectively.  The college also had 2,303 studentsenrolled on full-time higher education programmes.  There were 320 full-time equivalent staff, of whom 169 were teachers.  A staff profile, withstaff expressed as full-time equivalents, is shown in figure 4.25 The college\\u2019s mission is \\u2018to create an environment in which all clientscan develop appropriate skills, knowledge and quality standards to enablethem to compete, with advantage, at any level within the sectors we serve\\u2019.The college is committed to maintaining its mix of further and highereducation provision which provides clear pathways for students\\u2019progression from the age of 16 onwards.  Priorities include working closelywith schools, employers, TECs and other agencies to identify the needs ofstudents and communities, and providing development opportunities,including access to the latest learning resources, such as computer-basedlearning and the Internet.RESPONSIVENESS AND RANGE OF PROVISION6 Staff are knowledgeable about further education issues.  The college\\u2019smission statement and strategic objectives have been widely and wellcommunicated.  The college is committed to the national targets foreducation and training.  Its programmes include National VocationalQualifications (NVQs), General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs)and higher national certificates.  There is a wide range of courses inhospitality and catering, for which the college is a recognised centre ofexcellence.  There is also a good range of tourism, leisure, hairdressingand beauty therapy courses and, in recent years, there has been anexpansion of health and care courses.  Students have access to a widevariety of enrichment programmes including certification in first aid, theWines and Spirits Education Trust and several other subsidiary awards.7 A key feature of the college\\u2019s strategic plan is the provision of routesfor students to progress from further to higher education.  The college hasa long history of developing and teaching degree level programmes, mostrecently under an accreditation agreement with the University ofBirmingham.  There are also strong links with De Montfort University andthe University of Central England.  Many of the college\\u2019s further educationand higher national certificate programmes are internally validatedthrough an arrangement with the Business and Technology EducationCouncil (BTEC).  The college has established links with higher educationinstitutions in Europe and the Far East.8 The college has an effective marketing strategy which is regularlyreviewed by senior management.  The range of marketing activitiesorganised by the college caters well for the local, regional and internationaldimensions of its course provision.  College publicity and advertisingmaterials include videos and an interactive screen prospectus which isavailable in the reception area.  The marketing manager and two assistantswork with a graphic designer to produce well-designed prospectuses andcourse booklets.  Internal and external market research has enabled thecollege to develop effective strategies for its different markets.  The collegemakes good use of the TEC\\u2019s labour market analysis and informationprovided by the Birmingham economic development unit.  39 The links with local schools are well developed and form a key elementof college marketing.  The college is involved in the compact arrangementsacross the city and is keen to assist with curriculum development.  Thishas included specialist support for a local hospital school for emotionallydamaged pupils as well as direct support for events in schools, for example,in running an international week.  The college organises a range of opendays and taster events and provides places for pupils to undertake workexperience.  Corporation members and college staff regularly supportcollege marketing and public relations activities, such as the students\\u2019entry in the catering and hospitality show \\u2018live kitchen\\u2019 class and the Toqued\\u2019Or Nestl\\u00e9 food service award.  10 The college has secured substantial funding and sponsorship from arange of different organisations.  These include Bass Taverns, who haverecently refurbished a college restaurant to a very high standard, andNestl\\u00e9, who have sponsored the coffee shop.  A major wholesaler wasinvolved in supporting the development of the college\\u2019s internationalrestaurant.  The college has obtained funding from the European SocialFund for a skills development programme in tourism training.  Europeanfunding from Horizon, Leonardo and ADAPT has helped students toundertake educational visits and work experience in several countries.Work with agencies and employers has involved students in tourismprojects both locally, with the Birmingham Jewellery Quarter, andinternationally, with Jersey European Airways.  11 Long-standing working relationships are maintained with industrialgroups and employers and the college arranges industrial placements foralmost all full-time students. Links with employers are reinforced by long-established advisory panels, in which the local business communityis an enthusiastic participant.  Links with the TEC are primarily of astrategic nature, although TEC flexibility funds have been provided todevelop multi-media facilities for teaching food service theory.  The rangeof cost-recovery work undertaken by the college is varied and includesconsultancy to industry.  Recent projects have included: consultancy for acollege in Malaysia wishing to set up vocational programmes in the areasof tourism and hospitality; the design of a tearoom for the City ofBirmingham Museum; and training courses in catering for licensees forBass Taverns.12 The college has strong links with industry throughout the world.There is an annual exchange programme with the United States of America,the Far East and a wide range of European countries.  Students and staffhave taken part in exchange visits, most recently to China.  Languagetuition at a range of levels is offered to all students, irrespective of whetherit is a prescribed element of their course.  There is also good support inEnglish as a foreign language for the wide range of overseas students whoattend the college.413 Although there is well-structured support material of high quality toenable students to undertake independent study, the college has notdeveloped open and distance learning opportunities.  The provision ofsuch opportunities, together with more flexibility over the times of year atwhich students can enrol on courses and complete their awards, wouldenable the college to cater for a wider clientele than at present.14 A revised equal opportunities policy has recently been approved bythe academic board and is to be submitted to the corporation.  The policyis accompanied by a code of practice and a comprehensive action plan.  Itis well supported by an extensive programme of staff development.  Thecollege has an equal opportunities officer who reports regularly to asubcommittee of the academic board.  There is an annual review of theeffectiveness of the policy and code of practice which identifies the progressachieved and the priorities for action.  Enrolments are monitored by age,ethnicity, and disability.  College publicity material is regularly monitoredby the equal opportunities co-ordinator.  The access to higher educationprogramme has been particularly successful in recruiting students fromminority ethnic groups.GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT15 The college has a highly effective corporation, which provides strongstrategic direction.  There are 16 members.  One of the 10 independentmembers is a trade union leader; the others are drawn from the hospitalityindustry, business and the professions.  There is also a nominee of theBirmingham TEC, a police officer, a pro-vice-chancellor from a localuniversity, a member of the college teaching staff nominated by theacademic board, the president of the college guild of students, and theprincipal.  At the time of the inspection there was one vacancy for anindependent member.  Members of the corporation bring a wealth ofrelevant expertise to the college.  Procedures and criteria for theappointment of new members are currently under discussion.  Thecorporation meets at least termly.  Meetings are well attended andsupported by well-written reports and concise minutes.  Corporationpapers, apart from those dealing with a small number of confidentialitems, are available to members of the public.  The corporation has agreeda governors\\u2019 code of conduct and maintains a register of members\\u2019interests.  A helpful and comprehensive governors\\u2019 handbook has beenissued to all members.  16 The corporation has established an appropriate committee structureand revised terms of reference have been established for all committees.Although there is a remuneration committee, there is a lack of clarity aboutwhere responsibility lies for determining the remuneration of seniorpostholders.  Committee meetings are almost always well attended.  Onlyone committee meeting has been inquorate and effective action was takento address this.  The frequency of audit committee meetings has beenincreased in accordance with recommendations from the FEFC\\u2019s auditors.5Governors are well informed about further education matters in generaland about the key strategic issues to be addressed by the college.  Thechairman and clerk provide able leadership and support.  Governors haveattended training seminars and have conducted an assessment of theirfuture training needs.  They receive regular reports and briefings fromsenior staff.  17 The college\\u2019s 1994-97 strategic plan has well-defined aims andobjectives and clearly-stated strategies for achieving them.  The plan issupported by extensive needs analysis and market research.  It includes anumber of operating statements each with their own short-term aims andobjectives, the methods to be used for achieving these, the staff responsiblefor seeing that they are achieved, the timescales, and the budgets available.The operating statement in the 1995-97 updated plan does not reflect allthe key corporate objectives of the original plan.  The senior managementteam regularly monitors progress on the achievement of the college\\u2019sstrategic aims and operational objectives.  The results of this monitoring,together with adjustments made when targets are not achieved, arereported to the corporation.  Corporation members receive regularinformation on staffing and other non-financial information, such asenrolment, examination results, and destinations but data are providedfor the current year only.  The monitoring of college performance shouldbe strengthened by the production of data showing trends in performancefrom year to year and by the provision of an overall summary evaluation ofannual performance.18 Governors have a clear understanding of the distinction betweentheir responsibilities and those of the principal.  They focus broadly onstrategic matters but are also developing their understanding of theeducational context within which they operate in order to make a betterinformed contribution to the strategic planning process.  The process isco-ordinated by the deputy principal and begins with a review of theachievement of the previous year\\u2019s targets.  Faculty and central servicesplans contribute to the process, and use is made of labour market andother intelligence from a variety of sources.  Corporation members discussthe plan in detail before approving it.  Some programme area plans lacktargets and are not linked closely enough to faculty and college plans.19 The senior management team has formal terms of reference.  Theprincipal is supported by a deputy, two faculty heads, the director of financeand the college secretary.  They work closely as a team and provide strongleadership which is valued by staff.  They pay close attention to matters ofstrategic detail, including legislation, finance and the ethos of the college,and are united in their belief that the quality of provision for studentsshould be the basis for all decision making.  In this they are fully supportedby staff.  The management style of the college enables staff and students tofeel confident about making proposals and taking initiatives.  Agreed actionis effectively implemented by faculty and cross-college teams.  620 The academic board is at the head of an effective network for ensuringthat the principal is fully informed and advised on academic matters.  Itmeets once a term.  Three committees and two faculty boards report to it.The faculty boards co-ordinate the work of a range of programme boards.Within the two college faculties and the central services departments, linesof management and accountability are clear and well understood.  Regularmeetings of faculty and programme boards support the planning andmonitoring of curriculum provision.  A well-received new developmenthas been the staff handbook, which contains key policies and proceduresand is a useful reference document for all staff.  Regular newsletters,weekly diary updates and twice-yearly meetings of all staff contributeeffectively to good communications and a shared sense of purpose withinthe college.  At the level of individual programmes, and especially wherelarge numbers of staff are involved, there is sometimes too much relianceon informal communications.21 College policies are well established and regularly revised.  Theymake clear what the college aims to do about a wide range of issuesincluding health and safety, equal opportunities, personnel, and studentsupport.  Guiding principles, detailed practices, and monitoringarrangements are well documented.  For instance, the health and safetypolicy is supplemented by a manual of procedures and an inventory ofpotentially dangerous equipment which serves as the basis for a weeklyaudit.  College policies are effectively monitored.22 Enrolment targets are set in accordance with faculty priorities agreedby the senior management.  Enrolment targets, retention rates andattendance are closely monitored.  There are useful procedures forobtaining information on students\\u2019 destinations and these are beingdeveloped further.  The college met its growth target in the academic year1994-95 and, at the time of the inspection in October 1995, it was expectingto meet its target for 1995-96.  23 The college\\u2019s income and expenditure for the 12 months to July 1995are shown in figures 5 and 6.  The college\\u2019s average level of funding for1995-96 is \\u00a316.28 per unit.  The median for general further education andtertiary colleges is \\u00a317.84 and the median for all sector colleges is \\u00a318.56per unit.  24 Finance within the college has been controlled centrally but fromSeptember 1995 pay and non-pay expenditure budgets have beendelegated to the appropriate senior managers.  Budgets for pay expenditureare allocated on the basis of an agreed staffing complement for each areaof the college, while those for non-pay expenditure are made on a historicalbasis.  In both cases, adjustments are made for overachievement orunderachievement of target enrolments.  Progress on the development ofunit costing has been cautious.  The procedure for allocations has beenunder review and the college intends, during the current year, to implement7a new system based on the actual unit cost of delivery.  Financial reportsare presented at each meeting of the corporation and to the corporationchair, the finance and general purposes committee and the seniormanagement team at monthly intervals.  The quality of financial reportshas been progressively improved to make them easier to understand andmore useful to managers and corporation members.  The college has builtup a healthy financial position which has enabled it to undertake majorimprovements and developments from its own resources.25 The college has recently installed a new, fully-integratedcomputerised management information system.  Under the previoussystem faculty managers had ready access to information, but theinformation was not fully developed at programme area level.  A newinformation systems policy is in place and there is a clear strategy forimplementation.  The new system is already producing managementinformation.  Data are collected on student enrolments, retention,examinations and students\\u2019 destinations.  Attendance data are collectedby the faculties, but not yet collated at college level.  Teaching divisions arelinked to the system and further cable points are being installed to provideall staff with on-line information tailored to their needs.  Internal electronicmail and connection to the Internet have been included in the new system.  STUDENTS\\u2019 RECRUITMENT, GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT26 The college student services unit and faculties are responsible forstudents\\u2019 recruitment, guidance and support.  Their work is effectivelysupported by the city careers partnership, with which the college has asubstantial service level agreement.  This arrangement ensures thatstudents receive the advice and guidance they need.  The student servicesunit makes provision for personal counselling, careers guidance, studysupport, health care, overseas liaison, accommodation, nursery placesand financial and welfare advice.  It has established links with externalagencies to enhance the services provided.  27 Attendance at more than 50 careers events throughout the cityenables staff and students to act as ambassadors for the college.  Collegestaff also play a full and active part in college open days and evenings,contribute to guided tours of the college and provide taster days for school pupils.  Members of staff make overseas visits to recruit students.  High-quality promotional materials and other documents support theseactivities.  Careers events also take place in city centre sites and coursesare advertised in the local press.  Posters are placed in city libraries andpublic amenity areas.  Students had been made aware of the coursesavailable by the city careers partnership, college publicity and open daysand evenings, employers, relations and friends.  28 The college\\u2019s admission\\u2019s policy ensures that prospective studentsreceive the impartial advice and guidance they need to make well-informedcareer choices.  The procedures for admitting students are set out clearly.8Where appropriate, parents are invited to accompany prospective studentsto admission interviews.  Parents welcome the opportunity to be involved.Interviews are conducted by a team of teachers working to a commonformat.  Further advice and guidance is given at this time.  The range ofprogrammes available in the college provides opportunities for internaltransfers, and some students take advantage of this.  The initial choice ofcourse is checked again during induction and students wishing to transferfrom one course to another or to enter full-time employment are referredto the college or city careers advisers for further guidance.  29 Enrolment is effectively organised.  The procedures used ensure thatstudents continue to receive full and impartial advice.  All aspects ofenrolment are well integrated; students move smoothly from one phase tothe next.  For new students, the process commences with pre-enrolmentactivities in July.  For continuing students, enrolment can take place atany time from late June onwards.  Sufficient opportunities are given forstudents to ask questions and receive the information they need.Enrolment data are recorded electronically and continuously updated sothat up-to-the-minute information can be obtained from the system.  30 Induction is well organised.  All full-time students have one dayallocated for faculty induction and three days for the divisional inductionprogramme.  There is a shorter induction programme for part-timestudents.  Overseas students have a two-week induction programme.Further induction is conducted at the beginning of each course, or module,during the first weeks of teaching.  To support induction, student andfaculty handbooks and the student charter are distributed.  The studenthandbook includes information on programme content and a statementon assessment regulations and appeals procedures.  The faculty handbookcontains key information on fire procedures and college rules andregulations.  Full-time and part-time students report that inductionarrangements are helpful.  During induction, all students, apart from thosebeing admitted to higher national certificate courses, are assessed forbasic literacy and numeracy.  Where additional support is necessary, it isdelivered through timetabled sessions, workshops or attendance at thestudy support centre.  31 The college mentoring system is a strong feature of the arrangementsmade for academic and personal guidance.  Timetabled tutorials enablementors to give high-quality pastoral and academic support to students.  Ahandbook for mentors has been produced to ensure that this is conducteduniformly across the college.  A detailed careers resource pack for mentorsenhances the delivery of careers education.  Teachers receive staffdevelopment on mentoring to support this aspect of their work.32 A well-used confidential counselling service is provided by a full-timequalified student counsellor.  Appointments can be made through thestudent services unit, although students requiring urgent help are seenimmediately.  The counselling service offered is well managed and operates9effectively.  The service is appropriately located and accessible to students.Health care is provided by a qualified nurse.  Clear aims and objectiveshave been set to govern the service provided.  The nurse works closelywith the student counsellor and is a member of the college\\u2019s health andsafety committee.33 There are effective arrangements to support overseas students.During their induction period they are allocated accommodation in thecollege\\u2019s halls of residence.  The accommodation officer maintains anextensive list of private sector accommodation, which has been vetted bycollege staff.  Overseas students may obtain assistance on any aspect ofstudent life from the overseas students\\u2019 liaison officer.  34 The college has a policy and procedures for accrediting students\\u2019prior achievement.  However, the college\\u2019s alternative and preferredapproach is to use fast-tracking procedures to exempt from relevant unitsthe students who demonstrate that they have the necessary competence.This approach is quicker than gathering a portfolio of evidence and hasbeen particularly useful for students transferring from a course at anothercollege.  The college has conducted a research project with the Hotel andCatering Training Company to examine the possibilities for theaccreditation of prior learning in the hospitality sector.  The potential forthis method of accreditation has not yet been fully realised.35 The college asks school leavers to bring their national records ofachievement to the admission interview.  Not all do so.  It is not collegepractice to issue or to systematically maintain the national records ofachievement.  The college position is that course portfolios of students\\u2019work provide sufficient evidence of their achievements.36 The study support centre provides learning support for studentsidentified through diagnostic screening as needing additional help withliteracy, numeracy and information technology, as well as for thoserequiring general help with their studies.  To ensure that studentsdiagnosed as requiring support attend the centre, links have beenestablished between the centre and mentors who are responsible formonitoring students\\u2019 attendance and performance.  A daily usage recordis maintained which enables the manager to monitor attendance and filesamples of students\\u2019 work in order to monitor their progress.  Mentorsreceive formal notes informing them of students\\u2019 attendance and progress.The modern languages division conducts individual interviews withstudents to help place them in a class at the appropriate level.  The divisionhas a clearly-understood system of referral for students who fail to reachthe required standard in their assignments.  Some students receive goodsupport through the language workshop.  However, take-up for this is lowand students should be encouraged to make more use of the provision.  37 High-quality careers advice and guidance are provided by mentorsand the college careers adviser, in conjunction with the city careerspartnership.  Careers surgeries are conducted throughout the year to10ensure that students are following the right course, can make well-informed career choices and gain suitable employment on the successfulcompletion of their course.  Careers resources are conveniently locatedand sufficient careers literature is provided.  The absence of computerisedcareers databases is a weakness; the college is addressing this issue.Employers are invited to the college to recruit students who are nearingthe end of their course.  An annual careers event provides students withan opportunity to meet a wide range of employers.  The Department forEducation and Employment\\u2019s employment service operates a job shopthroughout the year for students requiring more information about workopportunities.  Some students had been unable to visit this because theirtimetables did not permit it.  Part-time and full-time jobs are also advertisedon strategically-placed notice boards throughout the college.  38 The college provides a range of additional resources to assist students,including specialist facilities for students with hearing or visualimpairment.  To enable students with young children to enter courses, thecollege has a well-resourced 50-place nursery, which it shares with thelocal community.  The college has an access fund and two hardship fundsand, where necessary, gives generous support to students for travelexpenses and for purchasing specialist equipment required for vocationalcourses.  39 The students\\u2019 guild provides representation, welfare information andsocial and sporting activities.  It caters for all students.  The guild has afull-time president, who is a member of the corporation and the academicboard.  The guild\\u2019s activities and societies are popular with students.  TEACHING AND THE PROMOTION OF LEARNING40 Of the 101 sessions observed 78 per cent received a grade 1 or 2.  Inonly 4 per cent of sessions did weaknesses clearly outweigh strengths.

Much teaching tookplace in realistic working environments.  There are long-standingarrangements for work experience which include codes of conduct forstudents and a well-managed assessment and reporting mechanism.  Morethan 1,760 students each year undertake periods of work experienceranging from three weeks to one year.  42 Catering and food service sessions were well planned andexceptionally well taught.  Courses were appropriate for the studentsrecruited and their intended careers.  Schemes of work were well developedand met the requirements of awarding bodies.  NVQ sessions had a goodbalance of tuition in basic practical skills and underpinning theoreticalknowledge.  Teaching in theory classes had clear aims, provided accuraterelevant and up-to-date information, and reinforced practical learning.  Inpractical classes the quality of teaching and learning was exceptionallygood and the standards achieved by the students were high.  Studentsbenefited from the realistic work environments and industrial workingpractices were frequently adopted.  For example, students following thestores module started at 07.00 each morning in the basement where theyworked alongside teachers, receiving and checking provisions.  Studentsbeing taught in the college restaurants dealt with a wide variety ofcustomers, had opportunities to develop their social skills, and learned towork under pressure.  Staff showed high levels of professional skill andprovided good role models.43 Teachers in hospitality administration were enthusiastic,knowledgeable and caring.  They provided effective support for adultsreturning to college, building their confidence and developing their studyskills.  When students fell behind with their work, they received friendlybut firm guidance.  Much classroom activity was directly related tovocational work.  In some classes there was good use of learning aids tostimulate interest and to minimise the time students spent taking notes.There were regular tutorials to review progress and provide support.However, in more than a quarter of the classes seen attendance wasapproximately 50 per cent.44 Classes in leisure and tourism were often stimulating and challenging;there was a good balance of input from tutors and activities which involvedstudents working alone or in groups.  Techniques to involve students, forexample the use of questionnaires to create discussion points duringclasses, were well developed.  The majority of teaching was well organisedand effective.  In some less effective teaching sessions tutors displayedlimited presentational skills.45 Standards of teaching were high in hairdressing and beauty.  Theteaching of practical work was particularly expert.  The salons provided a12highly realistic work environment in which there was always a professionalatmosphere.  The curriculum was well planned and organised so thatstudents worked with a wide range of clients and treatments.  However,courses did not include sufficient opportunities for students to developcore skills in information technology.  Attendance on some courses was amatter for concern.  46 In health and care, many classes included practical activities whichdeveloped students\\u2019 skills and confidence and helped them to practiseusing the equipment and materials to be found in their work placements.Tutors were knowledgeable and had relevant experience in social services.Students responded well to group activities.  In some of the better sessionsthey were encouraged to undertake independent research on the topic.Tutors frequently used questions to draw out and build on students\\u2019experience.  In some weaker sessions, they spent too long asking simplefactual questions on familiar topics.  Some students contributed little orallyand made only moderate progress with individual tasks.  Students\\u2019 use ofinformation technology on these programmes was limited.47 Schemes of work in foreign languages had a clear vocational focuswhich helped students to become familiar with the language related totheir main programmes of study.  Students were able to practise the fullrange of language skills in class.  There were examples of lively sessionswhere they confidently used the foreign language in response to teachers\\u2019questions and in role-play.  Some effective use was made of the languagelaboratory and audio-visual aids.  Teachers were fluent in the languagesthey taught.  However, in a significant number of classes there was toomuch use of English.  Learning was supported by good-quality handoutsbut these were sometimes overused.  In some sessions too little wasexpected of students.  There was little checking by teachers of whatstudents had learned and records of students\\u2019 progress were inadequate.The attendance level in some classes was low.48 In most programme areas the assessment and recording of students\\u2019progress was thorough.  The assessment of practical work was carefullyplanned.  Tutors explained assessment tasks and there were oftenopportunities for students to progress at speeds suited to their needs andabilities.  Assessments were challenging and took a variety of forms.Systems for monitoring students\\u2019 work and progress on NVQs were welldeveloped.  The marking of students\\u2019 assignments was usuallyaccompanied by clear guidelines on how they could improve the quality oftheir work.STUDENTS\\u2019 ACHIEVEMENTS49 Students are well motivated and enjoy their studies.  They speakhighly of the college, its staff and facilities.  The many customers andclients of the college\\u2019s restaurants, salons and shops provide theopportunity for students to display well-developed social and practicalskills.  Students are proud of the college\\u2019s reputation, eager to be part of itand to add to it.  1350 Students develop knowledge and understanding through a wide rangeof activity in both theory and practical classes.  This includes: a thoroughknowledge of food theory and science; an understanding of managementissues in hospitality management; good background knowledge in traveland tourism; and good technical knowledge in hairdressing and beauty.Their ability to apply this knowledge and understanding is clearlydemonstrated through assessed work leading to a range of qualifications.51 In all curriculum areas students learn to carry out practical worksafely and with high levels of competence.  High professional standards aredeveloped through the provision of realistic work environments inside thecollege and through the use of outside placements.  Excellent levels ofachievement in catering and bakery reflect the high professional calibre ofstaff and the standard of equipment in the college restaurants and kitchens.Hairdressing and beauty students acquire professional and social skills byworking in well-equipped salons which have a continuous flow of customers.Students studying health and care benefit from a well-planned placementprogramme.  In travel and tourism, and in language learning, the acquisitionof skills through the practical provision in the college is less strong.52 Students regularly achieve success in regional and nationalcompetitions and take part in joint ventures with the National ExhibitionCentre and other agencies and employers.  In the recent past, collegestudents have been regional and national finalists in a number ofprestigious competitions.  They have twice won the Moet Champagnechallenge and achieved third place in the National Indian Cookerycompetition.  The college has twice been designated Craft College of theYear (catering).  Students from the division of travel and tourism won theAmerican Express student of the year in 1992 and the American Expressbest achiever award in 1993.  Such activities enhance students\\u2019experiences and career prospects, and strengthen the college\\u2019s reputationas a centre of excellence.53 Students\\u2019 core skills are particularly well developed throughintegrated work.  Students\\u2019 written and oral work demonstrate thatappropriate levels are attained in communication.  Numeracy isdemonstrated through a range of activities requiring a knowledge ofquantity and the application of calculation skills.  Information technologyskills are used in data and spreadsheet creation and the use of specialistcomputerised systems is built into a number of programmes.  Somestudents, however, do not acquire appropriate wordprocessing skills inthe initial stages of their courses.  54 Students on NVQ and GNVQ courses have high levels of achievement.Ninety-four per cent of the 162 students aged 16-18 were successful intheir final year of study on the vocational courses included in 1994performance tables produced by the Department for Education (now theDepartment for Education and Employment).  This places the college14among the top third of colleges in the further education sector using thisperformance measure.  At NVQ level 1, 92 per cent of students aged 16-18and 78 per cent of students aged 19 years and over gained the award.  AtNVQ level 2, the respective figures were 86 per cent and 82 per cent and,at NVQ level 3, 100 per cent and 78 per cent.  There was a 100 per centpass rate at GNVQ intermediate level.  Pass rates in GNVQ external testswere high.  Performance in programmes giving NVQ equivalence fromlevels 1 to 4 ranged from 67 to 100 per cent.55 In  1994-95, the overall college pass rate for NVQ levels 1 and 2 was88 per cent and for NVQ level 3, 92 per cent.  Many students also achievedadditional specialist certificates in food, beverage, hygiene and health-related subjects.  One hundred and seven students were enteredfor the English Speaking Board examinations and 95 per cent passed.  In1994, 60 students enrolled on access courses for entry to higher education;46 per cent successfully completed the course and the majority of theremainder achieved some unit credits.56 In catering and in hospitality administration, examination resultswere especially good.  In 1994, no subject area had pass rates below 83per cent and there was a 100 per cent pass rate in some areas of work.Results in hairdressing and beauty were good; in 1994 there was a 100per cent pass rate in foundation certificate and national diplomaprogrammes.  The introduction of the Confederation of InternationalBeauty Therapy and Cosmetology programme in beauty therapy at NVQlevel 3 was particularly successful: 19 of the 20 students originally enrolledachieved the award.  Success rates for nursery nursing varied between 68and 70 per cent; BTEC social care achieved 95 per cent.  Large numbers ofstudents achieve accreditation at one of five levels in one or more modernlanguages; the majority of students achieve at least modest levels oflanguage competence.57 Full-time students have a good record of progress to further and highereducation and employment.  The table below shows students\\u2019 destinationsas a percentage of full-time students leaving the college in 1994.Higher Further Level education education Employment OtherFoundation/NVQ level 1 0 93 5 2Intermediate/NVQ level 2 7 18 70 5Advanced/NVQ level 3 25 7 63 5NVQ level 4 59 0 34 715In 1994, 39 students progressed from the national diploma in travel andtourism to higher national diploma and BA honours programmes in leisureand tourism management.  In the same year, 20 national diploma studentsin hospitality and catering progressed directly into the second year of thehigher national diploma.  Where students sought direct employment, thequality of the posts obtained was high and closely related to the trainingundertaken at college.  Part-time students, who were usually alreadyemployed, often used their training to further their careers.58 In 1994-95, just over 87 per cent of students completed theirprogrammes.  This is slightly below the regional and national average forsector colleges which is just under 90 per cent.  In a small number ofcourses more than 20 per cent of students withdrew in the first year.However, withdrawal is monitored through the college mentor system andstudents who withdraw often enter other courses or take up employment.QUALITY ASSURANCE59 The college has a commitment to quality assurance and to theimprovement of quality which covers all programmes and support services.The quality policy has been agreed by the academic board and is monitoredby its curriculum and quality development subcommittee.  An annualevaluation of quality is produced.  Regular newsletters provide staff withinformation on the implementation of relevant procedures and associatedstaff development.  Faculty boards and programme boards also supportthe development of quality assurance.  The college is committed to attainingthe International Standards Organisation (ISO) 9000 but has not achievedits original target date of May 1994 and estimates that it will require afurther two years to complete the work required.60 Existing procedures for quality assurance are clear and wellimplemented.  A continual quality review procedure has been developedfrom a college system of annual programme review; it will include aplanned schedule of reports at key points throughout the year.  The systemwas piloted towards the end of the last academic year.  Whilst there is acommitment from staff to implement this new approach to reporting, it isin its first year of operation and is, as yet, untested.  61 Effective action is taken in response to feedback from students andfrom internal and external assessors.  The programme boards establishedfor each programme area produce clear minutes of their meetings showingthe actions required and the points which are to be taken to the facultyboard.  Comments made by internal and external assessors are discussedand any necessary action is taken following internal and externalassessment and moderation.  62 An internal audit team of 12 members of staff representing all facultiesand support areas has been recently recruited and trained to carry outinternal quality audits modelled on Council Circular 93/28, AssessingAchievement.  The team conducted audits during the last academic year16and further audits are scheduled to take place through to August 1997.  Inresponse to the audit, the head of the faculty or department produces anaction plan to address any weaknesses identified.  This plan is reviewedby the curriculum and quality development subcommittee.  A summary ofthe strengths and weaknesses found by the audit team is also sent to theprincipal.  Improvements have taken place as a result of this audit process.  63 Staff and students are fully aware of the student charter and, togetherwith corporation members, have participated in its recent review.  Thecharter contains clear targets which underpin the college\\u2019s commitmentsto its students.  Whilst there is evidence of the monitoring of achievementagainst charter targets at programme and faculty operational levels, thereis no overall summary evaluation to give a college-wide perspective ofachievement against the targets set.64 Industrial placements are a significant element in the learningexperience of the students but there is no overall college policy or procedureto ensure agreed standards for the control and quality assurance of suchplacements.65 The college is committed to gaining the Investors in People awardand intends to apply for recognition status in November 1995.  The staff-development policy is well established and has been agreed by theacademic board.  The policy applies to all college staff.  The college investsa considerable percentage of its expenditure in staff development.Priorities are clearly stated in the staff training and development plan andthese are agreed by the academic board.  Progress against priorities ismonitored.  Evaluation includes an analysis of participation andexpenditure against priorities by faculty and department.  It includes anassessment of the quality of the training supplied by providers which isthen used to inform future planning of training.  66 The college introduced a staff-appraisal system in September 1994.There is an intention that all staff will be appraised annually, but thistarget has not been achieved; at the time of the inspection 92 per cent ofstaff had been appraised.  There are procedures designed to promoteconsistency in the implementation of the appraisal policy.  Staff have foundthe appraisal process supportive; it is focused on the identification ofindividual needs for training and development to support improvedperformance.  The continuous improvement of teamwork is also addressedby the allocation of a \\u00a3500 budget to each team to support agreed team-development activities.67 All new staff undertake a period of induction.  Criteria have beendeveloped to assess teaching competence and teaching is observed andassessed against these criteria during the first year of the appointment.Strengths and weaknesses are discussed with the teacher and an actionplan agreed where appropriate.  These procedures apply to all newly-recruited teachers, regardless of their previous teaching experience.171868 The college has produced a self-assessment report which addressesaspects of its operation under the headings of the Council Circular 93/28,Assessing Achievement.  Many of the strengths identified in the reportwere confirmed by the inspection team.  However, there was insufficientanalysis of weaknesses and judgements were not sufficiently linked tosupporting evidence.RESOURCESStaffing69 All college staff, whether teaching or non-teaching, work effectivelyin teams and have equal access to the full range of college procedures,including professional development and appraisal.  70 Teaching staff have a wide range of expertise and are highly qualified.Many staff have previous industrial experience which is substantial and ofhigh quality.  Much experience has been gained in international contexts.Since incorporation, the level of staff turnover has permitted the college torecruit staff with recent industrial experience whilst maintaining a core ofstaff with extensive teaching experience.  Most of those teaching practicalsubjects have advanced qualifications.  Eighty-six per cent of teaching staffhave an initial degree and 39 per cent have a higher degree.  Seventy-fourper cent of teachers have a teaching qualification.  Over 100 staff now holdTraining and Development Lead Body awards.71 Well-qualified support staff play a key role in the work of the college.The college has adopted a policy of deliberately employing a high ratio ofsupport staff so that teaching staff can concentrate on their teaching role.Since 1993, the number and range of support staff has grown significantly.Their deployment has been carefully monitored.  72 The personnel function has recently been reorganised to focus morestrongly on changing employment legislation and industrial relations.Ninety-seven per cent of teaching staff have new employment contracts.Personnel policies and procedures are well documented.  Training eventshave been organised to ensure that staff have information about thecollege\\u2019s approach to matters such as equal opportunities, recruitmentand sickness absence.  73 Forty-six per cent of teaching staff are female.  Whilst there arecurrently no female members of the senior management team, there aremany female middle managers.  Eight per cent of teaching staff are fromnon-white groups.  The proportion of staff from minority ethnic groupshas been increasing; almost 14 per cent of the staff recruited in the past 12months are from these groups.  Equipment/learning resources74 The college is strongly committed to providing the best possibleequipment for staff and students.  There is an effective policy for thereplacement of equipment on a rolling programme.  Major capitalexpenditure proposals are incorporated in the strategic plan.  The collegehas sufficient resources to finance capital expenditure from its own reserves.75 Curriculum areas are equipped to industry standards.  Courses incatering are well supported by the high quality of equipment.  In leisureand tourism the quality of equipment is generally satisfactory, althoughthe travel information centre would benefit from the availability of relevantcomputer software.  In hairdressing and beauty therapy the salons arewell equipped to industrial standards and benefit from the use of an up-to-date compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM) database.  Foreignlanguages teaching is supported by a new 16-position language laboratory,relevant videos and CD-ROMs.  76 The library has recently been refurbished at a cost of \\u00a3250,000.  Itnow shares space with the resource centre and this gives students easyaccess to different forms of learning materials.  The library is a specialistnational centre for hotel and catering and for tourism and leisure courses.Further education students benefit from access to the substantial learningresources available for higher education.  The library is well staffed andhas an adequate budget which has increased substantially in recent years.Catalogues and purchases are computerised.  Book issues have increasedvery rapidly in the last three years.  Helpful library guides are producedfor students and the library is highly responsive to requests for assistance.The environment is attractive and a quiet room is available for privatestudy.  In the main, the bookstock and journals provide good support forthe curriculum areas and there are 12 stand-alone CD-ROM players.Further education students under 19 receive free textbooks and otherstudents receive essential texts on annual loan.  The three library catalogueterminals available to students are insufficient to cope with the demand,although upgrading of this facility is under discussion.77 The college has over 300 personal computers, most of which arerecent models, and 90 machines are available in the resources centre on adrop-in basis.  A useful facility enables students to book equipment up toone week in advance.  The ratio of full-time equivalent students tocomputers is approximately 10:1.  The resource centre has good weekdayopening hours, and is also open at weekends.  There are some usefulintroductory guides to software applications.  Computers are available inother rooms for students to use outside timetabled hours.  There havebeen some recent shortages in technician support; the college has nowadvertised for replacements.  Information technology is well integratedwith the curriculum in most areas and there are some outstandingexamples of its use, notably the Remanco point-of-sale data systems usedin realistic working environments.  Although most students enter thecollege with information technology skills, there is no survey to establishthe levels of skills possessed by further education students; this makes itdifficult to match fully teaching and resources to students\\u2019 requirements.192078 The college information technology users\\u2019 group, which meetsfrequently, plays a major role in advising senior management on futurepolicy and in making specific recommendations for the purchase ofhardware and the development of networks.  The growing importance ofinformation technology for library resources would indicate a need for thelibrary to be represented on this group.  Although the library and resourcecentre are physically integrated, their management is separate.  Accommodation79 The college is housed in purpose-built premises on a prominent sitevery close to the city\\u2019s business centre and major tourist facilities.  Thecollege also rents some teaching and student residential accommodationaway from the main site.  The main building is an 11-storey tower block;teaching and administrative support is housed on the first nine floors andsome student social and residential accommodation on the remaining two.There are four distinctively-designed restaurants, a students\\u2019 refectory,four hairdressing and beauty therapy salons, a tourist information centre,a leisure centre and a bakery and patisserie shop.  Members of the publicwho have used these facilities are warm in their praise of the quality andservice provided.  The reception area is constantly busy and receptionstaff are always welcoming and willing to provide information.  There is a24-hour security service during term time and effective external lighting atnight.  Car parking on this city centre site, even with the addition of someleased spaces in a nearby car park, is very restricted.80 The college has a well-developed accommodation strategy.  A newcampus is being developed on a nearby site within walking distance of themain building.  Work, scheduled for completion in the summer of 1996,has already begun on new residential accommodation for students.  Thenew site is adjacent to a residential campus of the University of Birminghamand this may enable the college to reduce costs, for example, in cabling tobring the Internet to students\\u2019 residences.  Completion of thisaccommodation will release other accommodation on the top three floorsof the main building for conversion to teaching and other uses.  Inhairdressing and beauty therapy, any future growth will require additionalaccommodation.  In catering, some teaching areas are too small or ofinappropriate design for the number of students who occupy them.81 Accommodation is effectively managed.  The quality of rooms isgenerally good and there has been substantial investment in essential worksand a rolling programme of improvements.  Windows have been replacedand new lifts have been installed in the centre of the building.  Muchredecoration has taken place.  The building is clean and tidy and conveys alively, busy ethos.  There are attractive displays in some areas and thesignposting is clear.  Close attention has been paid to energy and waterconservation.  Ventilation of some parts of the building could be improved.Some accommodation is cramped and stuffy.82 The nature of the building has made it difficult to provide easy accessfor those with restricted mobility.  However, there are lifts to all floors,ramps to bridge changes in floor levels, and doorways which have beenwidened to accept wheelchairs.  Special arrangements have been madefor evacuation in case of fire.  The new lifts have been specially designedto cater for those with a range of disabilities.  It is unfortunate that toiletfacilities for students with disabilities are available only on the seventhand ninth floors.  The new hall of residence will have 18 rooms speciallyadapted to the needs of students with disabilities.83 A room-utilisation survey is carried out twice a year and is used as abasis for policy on future allocation.  Most rooms are allocated to thefaculties; the number of centrally-pooled rooms is small.  The flexiblepartitioning on each floor makes changes of use and size relatively easy,for example, the conversion of a former science laboratory into generalteaching accommodation.  Modern languages accommodation has beenrefurbished but the location of rooms on different floors means that theyare not used as effectively as they might be.84 Students resident in the main building have access to their own socialaccommodation.  The students\\u2019 refectory has been refurbished and is alively meeting place.  Other social accommodation for non-residentstudents is restricted to a basement bar in which smoking is allowed.There is no general social accommodation for non-smokers nor any whichis well adapted to the needs of mature students.CONCLUSIONS AND ISSUES85 The major strengths of Birmingham College of Food, Tourism andCreative Studies are:\\u2022 the strong and supportive leadership provided by the corporationand senior management \\u2022 clear lines of management and accountability, supported by goodinternal communications\\u2022 courses that offer substantial opportunities for the development ofskills in realistic work environments\\u2022 strong links with industry in the United Kingdom and overseas\\u2022 highly-qualified and suitably-experienced staff\\u2022 high standards of teaching on most courses\\u2022 good pass rates in most vocational areas\\u2022 the range of courses and opportunities for students to progress\\u2022 well-formulated and effective procedures for the recruitment,support and guidance of students\\u2022 a commitment to quality at all levels \\u2022 well-developed policy and practice for staff development\\u2022 equipment and accommodation which meet industrial standards.2186 If it is to continue to develop the quality of its provision, the collegeshould:\\u2022 improve its procedures for monitoring and reporting on performanceat college level\\u2022 establish a college policy for the management and quality assuranceof external work experience placements \\u2022 develop the provision of open and flexible learning \\u2022 review institutional policy on records of achievement\\u2022 improve attendance levels on some of its courses.22FIGURES1 Percentage of FEFC-funded enrolments by age (1995-96)2 Percentage of FEFC-funded enrolments by level of study (1995-96)3 FEFC-funded enrolments by mode of attendance and curriculumarea (1995-96)4 Staff profile \\u2013 staff expressed as full-time equivalents (1995-96)5 Income (for 12 months to July 1995) 6 Expenditure (for 12 months to July 1995) Note: the information contained in the figures was provided by thecollege to the inspection team.23Figure 1Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies: percentage of FEFC-funded enrolments by age (1995-96)Figure 2Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies: percentage of FEFC-funded enrolments by level of study (1995-96)24 FEFC-funded enrolments: 3,05225+ years16%16-18 years51%19-24 years33% FEFC-funded enrolments: 3,052Advanced28%Higher education2%Foundation49%Intermediate21%Figure 3Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies: FEFC-funded enrolmentsby mode of attendance and curriculum area (1995-96)Figure 4Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies: staff profile \\u2013 staffexpressed as full-time equivalents (1995-96)25 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400HumanitiesHealth and community careHotel and cateringBusinessSciencesPart-tiFull-timScien esBusin sHotel and cateri gHealth and community careHumanitiFEFC-funded enrolments: 3,052FEFC-funded enrolments0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400Full-time Part-timel-timert-ti e 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180Other supporting direct learning contactDirect learning contact Full-time Part-timel-timert-ti eFull-time equivalent staff: 320Direct learningcontactSupportingdir t learningcontactOther supportFull-time equivalent staff0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180Figure 5Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies: income (for 12 months toJuly 1995)Figure 6Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies: expenditure (for 12months to July 1995)26Education contractsTuition feesOther grant incomeOther operating incomeOther income-generating activitiesFEFC recurrent fundinCapital grantsEducation contractsTuition feesOther grant incomeOther operating incomeOther income-generatFC t fundi gi l c t  c t ctt  ii ii e-generatingactiviti sIncome: \\u00a314,169,00012%7% 4% 34%1%20%22% Interest payable Staff costsOther operating expensDepreciationInterest payableSt ff stst  ti g ese e i tiInterest lExpenditure: \\u00a310,930,00057%1%8%34%Published by theFurther Education Funding CouncilJanuary 1996\",\n",

Key Words: Strategy; Maintaining Quality; MSME Products    INTERACTION: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa Vol.11, No.2: Oktober 2024 P-ISSN: 2406-9558; E-ISSN: 2406-9566     255 INTRODUCTION  The development of the food and beverage industry sector in Indonesia is of great interest to investors. Product quality becomes very important because it is not only a reflection of customer expectations but also a critical factor for the sustainability of businesses in the long term. High-quality products foster customer loyalty, leading to repeat orders and positive recommendations. In a country as diverse as Indonesia, where culinary traditions vary greatly across regions, the food and beverage sector stands out as a key driver of economic growth. The unique flavors and rich heritage of Indonesian cuisine provide a competitive advantage, making the culinary landscape a promising field for entrepreneurship.  Furthermore, food and beverages represent fundamental human needs, as every individual requires sustenance for survival. This inherent demand ensures that the food and beverage industry remains resilient and adaptable, even in the face of economic fluctuations. The positive growth trajectory of this sector is evidenced by recent data from the Ministry of Industry, which reports that the growth of the food and beverage industry in the third quarter of 2022 reached 3.57%, surpassing the 3.49% growth recorded during the same period the previous year. Such statistics highlight the sector's robust performance and its potential to contribute significantly to Indonesia's overall economic development.  Given the vast culinary business opportunities in Indonesia, it is crucial for the government and industry stakeholders to prioritize the training and development of culinary businesses. By providing resources and support, the government can play a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of culinary MSMEs, ensuring that they not only meet local consumer demands but also compete effectively in the global market. Improved quality management can lead to increased productivity and innovation, enabling MSMEs to expand their market reach and improve their profitability.  Moreover, the culinary sector's growth has a broader impact on the national economy. It contributes to job creation, with culinary MSMEs absorbing a significant portion of the workforce. As these businesses thrive, they help uplift the livelihoods of countless individuals and families, particularly in rural and underserved communities. By fostering an environment conducive to culinary entrepreneurship, the government can also stimulate regional development and economic equity.  Another critical aspect of maintaining product quality is understanding the supply chain dynamics within the culinary industry. Ensuring the freshness and safety of ingredients is paramount for culinary MSMEs. This involves establishing strong relationships with local suppliers and farmers, emphasizing the importance of sourcing high-quality, sustainable ingredients. By promoting local produce, culinary businesses can enhance their offerings while supporting local economies.  INTERACTION: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa Vol.11, No.2: Oktober 2024 P-ISSN: 2406-9558; E-ISSN: 2406-9566     256 In addition, leveraging technology plays a significant role in improving product quality and operational efficiency. Culinary MSMEs can adopt digital tools for inventory management, customer engagement, and quality control. By embracing technology, these businesses can streamline processes, reduce waste, and ensure consistent quality across their product lines. Furthermore, online platforms provide opportunities for marketing and customer feedback, allowing businesses to adapt quickly to changing consumer preferences.  Consumer awareness and preferences are evolving rapidly, with an increasing demand for healthy, sustainable, and ethically produced food. Culinary MSMEs must stay attuned to these trends to remain competitive. By incorporating health-conscious ingredients, sustainable practices, and transparent sourcing, these businesses can cater to the growing segment of consumers seeking quality over quantity. The integration of culinary education and training programs is essential for developing skilled professionals in the food and beverage sector. Institutions offering culinary arts programs can collaborate with MSMEs to provide hands-on training, ensuring that future chefs and entrepreneurs possess the necessary skills to maintain high-quality standards. By investing in education, the industry can nurture a new generation of culinary talent capable of driving innovation and quality improvement.  Lastly, maintaining the quality of culinary MSMEs is not solely the responsibility of individual businesses. It requires a collaborative approach involving government agencies, industry associations, and educational institutions. By fostering partnerships and creating platforms for knowledge sharing, stakeholders can collectively address challenges and implement strategies that elevate the quality of culinary products across Indonesia. In conclusion, the strategies to maintain the quality of culinary Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are multi-faceted and require a holistic approach. By focusing on product quality, investing in training, leveraging technology, and understanding consumer preferences, the culinary sector can continue to thrive and contribute significantly to Indonesia's economic landscape. Through collaborative efforts, the government and industry stakeholders can ensure the sustainability and growth of culinary MSMEs, paving the way for a vibrant and prosperous food and beverage industry.  LITERATURE REVIEW  Previous Related Study  According to (Nasution, 1998), qualitative research is a research procedure that produces descriptive data in the form of written or spoken words, from people and observed behavior. In this research, an effort is made to collect as much descriptive data as possible which will be presented in the form of reports and descriptions.  Market globalization has implications for MSMEs who must compete in product marketing. The development of technology integrated with trade is moving so  INTERACTION: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa Vol.11, No.2: Oktober 2024 P-ISSN: 2406-9558; E-ISSN: 2406-9566     257 rapidly that it has given birth to the industrial revolution 4.0. The problem is that MSMEs still rely on conventional methods to run their businesses. (Ariescy, 2021).  According to (Kotler, Philip & Ketler, 2020), quality is the extent to which a product meets its specifications. A product is a collection of real physical attributes assembled in an identifiable form. While the quality parameter of a product is how satisfied customers are, not only that, the product can mean having a function of how producers can maintain customers' assessment views of their products.  MSME Products  The introduction of MSME products given at the end of each session made participants more enthusiastic in introducing their product brands. Here they also shared with the facilitator about how to make their presentations more interesting. Here participants also discussed how to make the creative content they created acceptable to the public so that they were interested in buying. Although the discussion was not part of the training material, it provided new ideas for the development of further community service (Agustina et al., 2021; Armiani et al., 2022; Putri, 2022).  Product quality is \\\"the ability of a product to perform its functions, it includes the product's overall durability, reliability, precision, ease of operation and repair, and other valued attributes\\\" or the ability of a product to function as it should to meet needs. Things that are measured or dimensions are reliability, accuracy, durability, ease of operation and repair of the product. Product quality is one of the things that marketers pay attention to in positioning. Product quality has an influence on customer satisfaction. (Kotler & Armstrong, 2012:283; Yafie et al. 2016).  Consumer satisfaction is the experience of satisfaction that customers get after consuming a product or service. Customers can compare the results or performance of a product with other products, whether it exceeds consumer expectations or hopes. If the product's ability to work exceeds consumer expectations, it can be interpreted that consumers are satisfied and vice versa if the product does not meet expectations, it can be said that consumers are less satisfied. (Kotler & Keller, 2012:46; Ogi et al. 2016). In the journal studied by Hawkins and Lonney; Tjiptono, 2004:101; Maimunah & Sardjono, 2019 there are three indicators of consumer satisfaction that must be considered by companies, including: 1. Conformity to consumer expectations. 2. Consumer interest in returning. 3. Consumer willingness to recommend to other consumers.  In order to contribute positively to all company activities in achieving its goals (D.Anggraini, 2020) In today's tight business competition, the most important thing that must be prioritized by the company is the quality of the products or services offered. If a company wants its company to grow, then every company must be able to provide good quality and provide a sense of security to its consumers, because that is one of the determining factors for the success of a company.  INTERACTION: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa Vol.11, No.2: Oktober 2024 P-ISSN: 2406-9558; E-ISSN: 2406-9566     258 RESEARCH METHOD  Design and Sample  This type of research uses a descriptive qualitative research method. Qualitative research is research that uses a scientific background, with the intention of interpreting the phenomena that occur and is carried out by involving various existing methods. In qualitative research, the methods usually used are interviews, observations, and document utilization. The concept analyzed from this study is the Strategy for Maintaining the Quality of MSME Culinary Products.  Instrument and Procedure  The data collection method used by the author is an interview. An interview is a conversation with a specific purpose. The conversation is conducted by both parties, namely the interviewer, who asks questions and the interviewee who provides answers to the statements. (Moleong, 2013). \\\"Data analysis is a process of systematically searching for and compiling data obtained from interview results by organizing data into categories, describing them into units, conducting systems, arranging them into patterns, choosing which ones are important and which ones will be analyzed and making conclusions so that they are easy to understand by yourself and others\\\". According to (Santori & Komariah, 2012), the stages of data analysis required are: Data collection. Data collection is carried out by means of observation, interviews and document review on the research subjects to be studied by the author. Data reduction (reduction) The data that has been obtained is then written in the form of a report or detailed data. The report is compiled based on the data obtained, summarized, the main points are selected and focused on the important things. Data display The next step is to reduce data or present data. Data presentation techniques in qualitative research can be done in the form of tables, graphs, and data presentation can be done in the form of brief descriptions, charts, relationships between categories, flowcharts and the like. Data display to facilitate and understand what is happening and also to plan further work based on what has been understood. Conclusion and verification Next is the drawing of conclusions and verification of what has been reduced previously. Verification is carried out throughout the research in line with triangulation so as to guarantee the significance or meaningfulness of the research results.  Data Analysis   Triangulation is a data validity checking technique that utilizes something other than the data for checking purposes or as a comparison to existing data. (Moleong, 2013) distinguishes four types of triangulation, namely utilizing sources, methods, and theories. The following is an explanation of the three types of triangulation above. The triangulation test conducted by the author is to obtain data through interviews with the four informants who have been determined, then the results of the interviews will be tested for validity using the source triangulation technique.  INTERACTION: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa Vol.11, No.2: Oktober 2024 P-ISSN: 2406-9558; E-ISSN: 2406-9566     259 The answers of the five informants obtained from the interview results will be compared with each other to test the consistency of the interview results obtained.  RESULT AND DISCUSSION  The research aimed to identify effective strategies for maintaining product quality in culinary Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The findings revealed several key strategies that can be implemented to ensure quality remains consistent, thus enhancing customer satisfaction and business sustainability.  One of the primary strategies identified was the simplification of processes. Lengthy production processes often lead to increased chances of errors. By simplifying processes, such as implementing single packaging and pre-mixing basic spices, culinary MSMEs can significantly reduce the potential for manufacturing mistakes. Shorter production times not only minimize errors but also enhance overall efficiency, enabling businesses to respond swiftly to consumer demands.  The establishment of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Station Observation Checklists (SOCs) is critical for ensuring product quality. The research highlighted the importance of creating detailed written SOPs and SOCs, complemented by instructional videos. These resources serve as valuable training tools for staff, ensuring that every branch adheres to the same quality standards. The use of videos is particularly beneficial, as they provide a visual reference that enhances understanding and retention, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high-quality products.  Furthermore, regular training sessions and the implementation of a Learning Management System (LMS) were deemed essential for upholding quality standards. Ongoing training reinforces the importance of quality control and helps employees stay updated on best practices. The LMS offers a cost-effective means of delivering training materials, including SOPs and SOCs in video format, thereby facilitating consistent learning and quality assurance across all branches. Conducting audits and employing mystery shoppers were also highlighted as effective strategies for maintaining product quality. Regular audits at various stages of the production process, as well as during service delivery, allow for the identification of potential quality issues. Mystery shopping, whether conducted in-person or through delivery orders, provides an objective assessment of the customer experience, enabling businesses to identify areas for improvement without bias.  The research emphasized the importance of conducting regular consumer surveys to gather feedback on product quality. Engaging directly with customers, particularly loyal patrons, allows culinary MSMEs to understand their preferences and address any concerns promptly. By actively seeking consumer input and responding to complaints, businesses can foster trust and encourage repeat patronage, which is crucial for long-term success.   INTERACTION: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa Vol.11, No.2: Oktober 2024 P-ISSN: 2406-9558; E-ISSN: 2406-9566     260 Additionally, monitoring review sites and social media is vital for maintaining a positive brand image and responding to customer feedback. By keeping an eye on platforms like Google Reviews, Instagram, and TikTok, culinary MSMEs can swiftly address complaints and implement necessary improvements. Proactive engagement with consumers on these platforms not only enhances product quality but also builds a strong rapport with customers.  Another critical factor in ensuring product quality is the control of raw material receipt and storage. The research underscores the importance of establishing SOPs for the handling of raw materials, including guidelines for receipt and storage. Ensuring that vendors comply with quality standards is essential, as the quality of ingredients directly impacts the final product. Regular audits of raw material storage practices can help maintain high standards and prevent quality degradation.  The study also highlighted the necessity of setting raw material and vendor quality standards. By selecting high-quality ingredients that align with market demands, culinary MSMEs can enhance their product offerings. Establishing clear specifications for raw materials and diversifying vendor relationships mitigates risks associated with supply shortages and ensures a consistent supply of quality ingredients.  The role of supporting equipment and supplies in maintaining product quality cannot be overlooked. Standardizing equipment and supplies helps ensure that all culinary processes are performed consistently, which is particularly important in businesses where not all staff members are professional chefs. Detailed SOPs provide clear instructions, allowing staff to operate equipment effectively and maintain high standards.  Furthermore, instilling a culture of quality and adherence to established rules among employees is crucial. The research found that fostering a culture that values cleanliness and adherence to quality standards is essential for maintaining product quality. Employees should be educated on the importance of following SOPs and the consequences of deviating from established practices. Implementing a system of rewards and punishments based on quality performance can motivate staff to uphold high standards. Recognizing and rewarding employees for their contributions to maintaining product quality encourages continued dedication, while addressing quality issues through evaluations promotes accountability and improvement.  Lastly, the research highlighted the importance of a clear organizational structure within culinary MSMEs. A well-defined structure clarifies roles and responsibilities related to product quality, ensuring that directives are executed effectively. As businesses expand, it becomes essential to have competent personnel in place to manage operations efficiently, thereby contributing to sustained quality assurance.   INTERACTION: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa Vol.11, No.2: Oktober 2024 P-ISSN: 2406-9558; E-ISSN: 2406-9566     261 In conclusion, maintaining the quality of culinary Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) involves a multi-faceted approach that includes process simplification, detailed SOPs, regular training, audits, consumer engagement, and a strong organizational structure. By implementing these strategies, culinary MSMEs can enhance product quality, foster customer loyalty, and ensure long-term success in a competitive industry.

Introduction The setting of this paper is the implementation of Mystery Shopper visits, carried out by an organization related to the hospitality business with a hotel chain in Portugal and abroad, having the purpose of testing the efficiency of this tool. The study was based on, two interviews, one to the General Manager of the hotel that was the subject of this research, and the other to the Head of the Training Department of the Hotel Chain. Also, two inspection audits were applied through a Mystery Shopper questionnaire, and in addition, information was collected through research in books, articles on Marketing, Management and Quality Management.  In this rapid growing experience economy, customers are seeking more variety and customization than they used to in the past (McColl-Kennedy et al., 2015). Some theories support a systematic feedback to employees on their performance. These theories also uphold that this factor contributes to a critical self-analysis of its output. (Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar, 2012). There is no measuring tool that assesses restaurants nor a standardized and official rating system in Portugal. It is suggested by Liu, Su, Ganc, & Chou, (2014), that the decision-making organizations, including government departments, create or adapt assessment models, and reveal the results with the    Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   488 objective of improving the quality of the food and beverage industry. Food is a very important source of revenue for tourism. (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). As part of the strategy, restaurants can be turned into a tourism topic through its assessment and promotion. For this, it is important to understand how to identify the restaurants with great quality service. This study brings some significant contributions to the extent that it is pioneer in Portugal, in the development of an assessment of the quality of service in restaurants, through the Mystery Shopper (M.S.) tool. Consequently, solutions are proposed so that all the departments of a hotel comply with the procedures, thus increasing the consistency of the service provided and the degree of customer satisfaction. This study makes it possible to see if this tool effectively produces an improvement in the compliance with standards in a practical context and functions as a pilot project, being prepared to replicate in other restaurants and hotels. The purpose of this study is to briefly explain the operation model regarding the implementation of Mystery Shopper visits. For this, a literature review was elaborated to analyze and relate concepts regarding the Mystery Shopper, a revised outline was proposed, and the results were analyzed and interpreted, which allowed the final conclusions.  2. Literature Review Quality, in the tourism service industry, is the main factor that serves to differentiate one hotel to another. The quality of service delivery is the most important element in this equation. (Madar, 2017). Hotel General Managers receive constant feedback from their consumers via customer satisfaction surveys, online reviews, letters, e-mails, and in-person complaints, among others. General Managers also receive information from experts who usually evaluate hotels. This information can come in the form of hotel rating systems and mystery shopping. Management also receives feedback from corporate executives, employees, and other internal stakeholders. However, a key question remains: what forms of feedback are most relevant, and how are they used? (Torres, Adler, & Behnke, 2014). There are several assessment systems for restaurants, as is the case with Zagat Restaurant Survey1, which assesses restaurants based on three criteria: food, decoration and service. The highest score is 30 points (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). Currently, the most prestigious rankings in Portugal for hotels and restaurants are Boa Cama Boa Mesa of Expresso, Trip Adviser, Booking and the Red Michelin Guide2. Studies point to the fact that the latter, influences restaurants in several aspects namely in the change of prices, income and social position of the chefs as well as its prestige. (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). Despite the great influence of the Red Michelin Guide in the restaurant and catering industry, the assessment criteria for obtaining the certificates in the different categories have never been disclosed. This represents a gap in academic research with regard to the creation of consistent criteria for assessing the service quality in restaurants. (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). According to Evans, Stonehouse, & Campbell, (2003) the following indicators should be considered when assessing service quality in restaurants: quality of the ingredients and their production; cooking skill and talent; characteristics of the meal; menu balance; experience of each visit. The waiter is a critical element that directly affects restaurant\\u00b4s revenue. (Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar, 2012). The main objective is to understand whether a Mystery Shopper\\u00b4s feedback can potentiate on job training, improve sales performance, and exceed customer expectations at the same time. There are several studies that focus on the relationship between quality of service and restaurant rating, since quality of service has already been recognized as an important standard in the selection of a restaurant. For Xie et. Al (2014), service quality in restaurants is directly related to the perceived value and experience of the meal. It is understood by perceived value the assessment of the food, service, environment and price. These factors actively contribute to the client's emotional behavior (Liu, Su, &                                                    1Most used guide in the United States for the Restaurant Industry <URL: https://www.zagat.com> 2Restaurant Guide used worldwide <URL:https://www.viamichelin.com>    Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   489 Chou, 2014). In today's dynamic hospitality industry, specialists have to make decisions on how to best allocate their efforts to improve or sustain service quality. Consequently, the practitioners' perceptions of the importance of consumer and expert feedback are particularly valuable. (Torres, Adler, & Behnke, 2014). Therefore, this study intends to fill the gaps of previous studies integrating the Mystery Shopper as a way of observation, with the aim of improving service delivery through continuous training taking into consideration the Mystery Shopper\\u00b4s feedback. Like any external audit, this project will bring additional costs. The Vice President of the study elaborated by Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar (2012) - which aims to implement Mystery Shopper visits in a Restaurant chain \\u2013 explains that $1 spent on the program had a return of $ 2 of profit due to increased sales. Another of the indirect benefits and more difficult to measure, is the improvement of the service provided which was only possible due to continuous training through constant feedback from the Mystery Shopper.  Service Quality Cited in Pinto & Soares (2011), Mikel J. Harry says that, \\u201cquality is a state in which there is value creation for the customer and the supplier in all aspects of the business relationship\\u201d. According to the definition in the standard NP EN ISO 9000:2005 quality is understood as a \\u201cdegree of satisfaction of requirements given by a set of intrinsic characteristics\\u201d. Pinto & Soares (2011) state that the success of any organization depends directly on its ability to mobilize and organize the means and resources needed to produce products and/or services that meet the requirements, needs and expectations of its customers. As such, quality is the engine of success for organizations and paves the way to the effectiveness and continuous improvement of methods and processes. Research on Michelin-starred restaurants claim that more expensive restaurants have more resources to maintain a quality service, food and environment (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). The service industry is the largest driver of the economy in developed countries (Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar, 2012). Since consumers will make decisions and take an action based on their perceptions, there is urgent need for the hotel industry to take an effort in comprehending and understanding consumer\\u00b4s expectation in order to provide good quality services. (\\u021a\\u00ee\\u021bu, R\\u0103ulea, & \\u021a\\u00ee\\u021bu, 2016) According to Gr\\u00f6nroos (1990) service is an activity or series of activities of a more or less tangible nature, which normally, but not necessarily, occurs during the interaction between customers, and service employees or physical resources or assets, which are provided as a solution to a problem or customer need.  The hotel service demands: constant innovation, increasing performance and quality. Quality is directly associated to the differentiation of the service. The more personalized the service, the closer it is to the customer's needs. Thus, differentiation puts the company in a privileged position in the conquest and maintenance of markets. The differentiation of a product or service from the competition is a factor that contributes to the success of the company and to the valuation by the customers. The result is the competitive advantage, generated by the differentiation, creating conditions to increase the profit of the Hotel. (Almeida, 2010). Sometimes there is a gap, between the quality that the company produces and the one that the customer needs, situations in which the company is making efforts and making investments that are not recognized or valued by the customer, thus wasting various resources. (Almeida, 2010). The norms NP EN ISO 9000, presented by the International Standard Organisation (ISO), explicit the concept of quality in the capacity of a set of characteristics inherent to the product, system and process to meet the requirements of customers as well as other stakeholders in the company, considering it as the degree of satisfaction of requirements given by a set of intrinsic characteristics. (IPQ, 2005). From a management point of view, quality is a fundamental concept that branches from the need of companies to meet, or even exceed, customer expectations. (Costa & Sousa, 2011). In order to be able to provide a quality service, it is necessary to know the requirements associated with the client\\u00b4s needs and to meet them or, if possible, to overcome them.     Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   490 Mystery Shopper Although the Mystery Shopper tool it is a technique known and used worldwide, in Portugal it is little applied. The mystery client is a technique that aims anonymous observations of the service provided from the consumer\\u00b4s point of view (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). According to Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar (2012), the mystery shoppers are usually hired by organizations in the service industry, and are also known as ghost, anonymous or secret customers. Through this technique, managers can specifically evaluate standards they would like to see measured. (Sykes, 2011). Several studies point to the contribution of this technique through better performance in a short period of time. After visiting the restaurant, the mystery shopper completes a series of reports, providing all relevant information such as: performance of service providers working at the front-office, product quality, compliance with procedures and other potential problems. (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). This gives the manager the opportunity to improve performance - sometimes in areas that seemed to be working properly (Sykes, 2011). One of the internationally known companies providing this service in the hotel sector is the Leading Hotels of the World (LHW)3 through their leading quality assurance program. This program promotes at the request of the hotel, solutions for the quality management, such as mystery shopper audits to the service and training for employees. Sykes (2011), tells us to think about each Mystery Shopper report as an instant picture of what is happening in a given period of time. Since business is not static \\u2013 its constantly changing - the more pictures we get together, the better we know what's happening.  Procedures and Audit The backbone of any quality management system (QMS)4 is it\\u00b4s documentation (Pinto & Soares, 2011). So that the system is not too bureaucratic, thus losing some efficiency, the documentation should be managed in a practical way ensuring that relevant information on quality is reached by all who need it, and it must also be of quality.  Pinto & Soares (2011), define procedures such as the documents that establish guidelines and methods to carry out and manage the necessary activities in order to ensure the Quality Management System. For Pinto & Soares (2011), audit can be defined as actions taken in accordance with a plan established to ensure that the relevant processes and activities relevant to quality are carried out and maintained at an appropriate level of effectiveness. Willborn (2006), states that audits have to be systematic and underline the importance of creating a cycle scheme. It is based on this assertion that, for this study, the scheme shown in figure 2 was created for a more effective control of the inspection. It is based on these concepts that a system was created for the implementation of the Mystery Shopper tool. In order to stimulate research in this area to help the hotel chain with the application and measurement of a quality service.  3. Methodology Following a study by Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar (2012), an on job training program was developed for waiters to improve performance, behavior, customer interaction, and customer satisfaction. These inputs were created by studying the mission, values and strategy of the company, thus ensuring that all employees involved were able to perform their duties and in accordance with the principles of the company. Figure 1 shows the work process timeline that was predetermined for an efficient                                                    3 A Leading Hotels of the World is a prestigious organization that operates in luxury hotels and represents the most exquisite hotels and resorts in the world <URL: http://www.lhw.com> 4 Quality Management System \\u2013 According to Pinto & Soares, 2011, represent the organization's culture that enables them to provide products and services that can meet the needs and expectations of customers.    Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   491 implementation of Mystery Shopper (M.S.). inspections.   Figure 1 - Timeline  What is proposed is to create a cycle of audits as shown in figure 2, which can later be used to create a historic of evaluations and corrective actions to prevent the recurrence of past mistakes.                                   Figure 2 \\u2013 Inspection Cycle  The first inspection was done without the employees' awareness in order to analyze the service without any influence. Sykes (2011) argues that once we share with employees the intention to start a M.S. program, we will change the working environment and influence the sequence of inspections.  Presentation of Mystery Shopper evaluations to organization management and operation In each assessment, the results were sent to the administration in the shape of a report where the most important information was condensed as procedures that were more, or less accomplished in the different sale points.

Following the suggestions of the Head of the Training Department, the presentation of the results was very dynamic. We assemble all employees involved in the study and together we filled out the questionnaire used in the inspection by M.S., as a self-assessment. After analyzing the self-assessment score, the real results of the first inspection were presented with the purpose of comparing with the self-assessment. At this point, it is very important to reflect and try to understand the employee\\u2019s opinion, analyzing what led them to make certain mistakes. Over a period of time, supervisors reinforced technical training, taking into account the most common mistakes dictated by the first inspection. The second inspection was then carried out. This time the presentation of the results was simpler, corresponding only to an informative presentation.  Questionnaire designing Based on other studies, the questionnaire was designed based on the following dimensions: (1) Reservation: Assesses the telephone service and the skill of the employee during the conversation; (2) Arrival: This dimension assesses the behavior of the employee in the first contact as well but also how the employee hosts the customer to the table; (3) Menu: evaluates the design of the menu, the language used, grammar, hygiene and if the product corresponds to what is mentioned in it; (4) Order: Evaluates how the employee lists the order by analyzing their speech and expertise as well their willingness to sell; (5) Beverage Service: Evaluates the employee's technical knowledge regarding the beverage service as well the ability to increase sales; (6) Service: Evaluates the interaction at the level of anticipation of the employee in relation to the needs of the client, technical knowledge and ability to increase sales; (7) Employee Behavior: Evaluates employee behavior, language used, how it behaves and relates to colleagues in front of the client; (8) Buffet: Evaluates the presentation, cleaning and functionality of the Buffet; (9) Food: evaluates the quality, presentation and variety of food; (10) Presentation of the table: evaluates the assembly of the tables, the set-up, presentation and cleanliness. Each dimension of this questionnaire consists of several questions with locked answer between \\\"meet\\\", \\\"below\\\" and \\\"Not Applicable\\\". This kind of response, was considered so that it could be extended to the maximum number of standards to be evaluated without making it too difficult to fill from M.S. point of view (Sykes, 2011). Each question was built taking into account the hotel's procedures manual and can thus effectively analyze whether each procedure was completed or not. Another concern in the design of the questionnaire was the order of the questions. These were sequenced according the natural sequence of the service. Thus, the inspector can fill out the questionnaire discreetly through an electronic device such as a tablet or smartphone as the service is being provided and can immediately send the evaluation to the supervisor to prepare the rectification of the inaccuracies for the next shift. The \\u201cprice\\\" was considered too subjective to be assessed in this study. The perception of the price is in some way related to the income of each one, as well as its social class, cultural context, among other factors. For all the reasons, the price was not considered in this study.  !\\u00ba\\t$%&\\t'&(!)(*)'(!\\u00ba\\t&,&(-\\t'&(!)(*)'\\t.\\t!\\u00ba\\t//1\\t'&(!)(*)') \\u00d7 \\t100     (1)  Equation (1) shows the formula of how the outlet score is calculated. The formula divides the number of met standards by the total number of standards excluding those not applicable. The formula was based on the LHW system, the study of Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar (2012), and the criteria created by Liu, Su, & Chou (2014) in their article on evaluation scales for restaurants.  Recruitment, profile and training of Mystery Shopper The choice of M.S. is a crucial factor for the effectiveness of the tool. Contrary to an auditor, M.S. does not necessarily have a specific qualification, nor should they be professionals in the industry. According to Sykes (2011), they may even be the customers themselves of the organization that they inspect. In their study, Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar (2012) developed a system in which the M.S. were the customers themselves and in return the restaurant chain refunded part of the meal money once M.S.    Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   493 completed the questionnaire. Sykes (2011) also says that M.S. has to have the ability to follow orders, have fundamental knowledge of arithmetic and be an excellent communicator and, very important, special attention to detail. Another concern was that the inspector represented the target of the hotel. Before the first evaluation, the questionnaire was tested in another hotel, and simultaneously this test worked as a training for the M.S. As the service elapsed, we filled out the questionnaire to clarify the doubts of the recruited.  4. Results Discussion 1.st Inspection The first inspection took place on March 21 and 22, 2016. Figure 3 shows the percentage score of each outlet. Instead of analyzing each outlet, the decision was to analyze which procedures were not met transversally, if they were not met at any of the outlets it is because the message is not passing properly from the supervisors to the restaurant staff, which means that is where the improvement has to begin.    Figure 3 \\u2013 Percentage score by outlet (1st Inspection)  \\u2022 One of the failed procedures was the attempt to increase sales by offering drinks and complementary foods such as snacks, coffees, desserts, among others. \\u2022 Both at breakfast and in the restaurant, the waiter has access to the client's name. Even so, in none of these points of sale the customer was hosted by his name. \\u2022 In any part of the service was offered reading material to the client, action required according to the standards of the hotel. \\u2022 Except for the restaurant, M.S. evaluated the service as not very intuitive, in example, the client's needs were not anticipated. \\u2022 The only menu that was considered clean and well written was the room service. All others were considered dirty, poorly written, or obsolete. \\u2022 There are no vegetarian options in the menus as set out in the standards. \\u2022 The interaction with the customer was also very weak. The customer did not feel that the service was customized.  There are punctual and simple mistakes that together had a lot of influence on the score, for 58%78%65% 63%0%20%40%60%80%100%Breakfast Restaurant DrinksServicesLight\\tMeals   Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   494 example: lack of the glass coaster at the bar; left elements to be removed from the tables at the end of the meal; the employees did not say goodbye to customers, among others. Also note the positive aspects. The restaurant had a high score. We believe that it is essentially due to the fact that the supervisor himself is present during the period of restaurant service.  \\u2022 In every outlet the food was considered to have good presentation, tasty, served at the right temperature and made with fresh products. \\u2022 In general, employees were considered to have alert postures, a high level of confidence, well arranged and spoken English well. \\u2022 The tables were considered clean, organized and in good shape. 2.nd Inspection The second inspection took place between 8 and 18 August 2016. Figure 4 shows the percentage score for each point of sale in the second inspection. The percentage corresponds to the number of procedures that have been completed, excluding those that are not applicable. It should be noted that the occupancy was much higher during the second inspection than in the first one, which could have been a risk factor for standard compliance \\u2013 more workflow, more difficult to meet the standards. This assumption did not occur. As can be seen, the average evaluation between the points of sale was 66% in the first inspection and 81% in the second inspection - which corresponds to an increase of 15 percentage points.   Figure 4 - Percentage score by outlet (2st Inspection)  \\u2022 Except for the restaurant and breakfast, M.S. continues to evaluate the service as unintuitive, in example customer needs were not anticipated. \\u2022 There is still no vegetarian option as set out in the standards. \\u2022 This time, only in the light meals service, the interaction was considered weak and not customized. Contrary to the 1st inspection, where this opinion had been verified in all outlets. \\u2022 In all outlets the food was considered to have good presentation, tasty, served at the 88% 88%72% 76%0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%Breakfast Restaurant Drinks\\tServices Light\\tMeals   Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   495 right temperature and made with fresh products. \\u2022 Regarding up selling, there is a big improvement but there are still points that need to be reinforced.  5. Conclusion With this improvement of compliance with the procedures of the hotel chain, this tool can be an added value if applied and monitored continuously through an external evaluation that is coordinated with the intermediate managers. At the prominence of a Mystery Shopper inspection, the employees are more aware, and thus, are more sensitive to the detail and the compliance of the procedures, being a very effective tool in assisting the training of teams and also in helping the decision making by the managers. Because at the first audit many of the employees were completely unaware of the standards, a 15 percentage point increase in the average evaluation were expected. In a potential next evaluation, the improvement would certainly be slower. It should be noted that the behavior of all employees regarding the acceptance of the implementation of the project was exemplary. All of them committed themselves to pay more attention to the standards. In the development of the project, there was also an extra motivation and healthy motivation in the performance of the functions, in the sense of trying to see if they were serving the Mystery Shopper. The dynamic of the present ever-changing market is a reality that influences the performance of companies. Although the positioning of a brand may possibly be associated with a type of status/advantage, this does not guarantee that this position does not require an analysis. This should be monitored whenever possible, seeking to assess and correct any anomalies. Managers need to create value not only for the company but also for their target audience, reducing costs, streamlining processes and standing out positively from the competitors. In this way, the tool presented in this study proved to be highly effective, and a good help for managers to overcome the challenges created by the present ever-changing market. It was considered that this tool should be part of the company's strategy and be seen in the long run, so managers can create a historic and simultaneously cultivating the creation of a ranking among hotels to try to perceive which hotels have the highest percentage of compliance with the standards, thus creating a healthy competition between hotels, but also, with the purpose of having an exchange of knowledge, with the responsibility of those who hold the top places in the ranking to train those with a low score. The fact that feedback is given by third parties (M.S.) allows the supervisor to perform his duties correctly, drawing attention and criticizing the work of his subordinates, without worry that the employee feels that the evaluation is personal and partial. We can consider M.S. as a neutral observer, who knows nothing about each employee, than his performance. Inspection reports were also considered, not be used as a disciplinary tool for punishment, but rather as an opportunity to improve and reward good performance. It is very important to publish the results in the internal corridors to remember, motivate and recognize the work of employees. Future studies and limitations Firstly, this study doesn\\u2019t focus anywhere on the quality of the infrastructure at the level of the atmosphere provided to the customers through the decoration and comfort. Future research may include criteria related to this point. Second, food processing consumes a lot of energy and resources, which leads to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, due to the phenomenon of global warming, it is recommended that future research include environmental impact as a criterion to be considered. Third, after testing the score system, it was perceived that the score of each dimension should be analyzed individually, and thus more easily detect the focus of the problem. Fourth, for a more efficient inspection, that is, to make better use of the tool, evaluations should be considered in all departments including: reservations, luggage, housekeeping, reception, concierge, common areas, gym and SPA. One should know that these inspections have a cost. Thus, this cost is    Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   496 minimized is used in more outlets which leads to more reviews. Fifth, no part of this study refers to the costs associated with project implementation. Future studies should include cost forecasts for companies to be able to allocate costs in their annual budgets in a timely manner. 6. References Almeida, A. E. (2010).

INTRODUCTION Indonesia is a democratic country that is secular, and the majority of its population is Muslim or Muslim. In Islamic shari'a the human lifestyle has been regulated as well as possible as a religion that is very concerned about the human body and soul, humans make eating and drinking a necessity that must be prioritized, it's just that Islam has imposed the concept of halal which we must practice, especially everything that is categorized as food must be halal, not the slightest contamination with dubious ingredients. on February 2, 2021, the President enacted Government Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    242 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 Regulation No. 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Sector which automatically replaces the previous PP, namely PP No. 31 of 2019. After the enactment of Government Regulation No. 39 of 2021, the government requires food products, beverages, medicines, cosmetics and other products to have clear halal status by having halal certification. MUI through the LPPOM Halal Examining Agency and the fatwa commission seeks to provide assurance of halal products through the halal certificate instrument. As a guarantee for religious believers in carrying out worship and practicing their religion, the state is obliged to provide protection and guarantees about the halalness of products consumed and used by Muslim consumers (Syafrida: 2016). Halal products are an important part of today's business world. This is because halal products are predicted to have a large potential value and are also promising, not only for Muslims but also for those who are not Muslims (Syafrida: 2016). The Tighe report (2022) released by Statista shows that the estimated potential value of the Muslim market in the world in 2024 is 2.4 trillion USD3 . Shahbandeh (2021) made a detailed report that the market share of the halal industry in the world is dominated by the Islamic finance sector by 53.42% and food by 31.46%4 . Therefore, halal products are not only the focus of Islamic countries, but also secular countries, even countries with Muslim minorities. In Indonesia, halal trends and lifestyles have begun to emerge. This is marked by more selective consumers paying attention to the halal labeling of a product before they make a purchase decision. This selective behavior will certainly encourage the creativity and motivation of business actors to make halal-certified products. In the world, halal food is growing rapidly because not only Muslims are tempted by halal food but also non-Muslims because halal food is guaranteed in terms of hygiene and health. The invasion of imported food is quite a challenge, especially since Indonesia is a country with a majority Muslim population, other countries will compete to reach consumers in order to gain company profits (Peristiwo, 2019). In accelerating the implementation of halal standards where one of the things needed is halal certification, a law was issued to support the implementation of halal standards. Based on Law Number 33 of 2014 concerning Halal Product Guarantee, Article 4 states that halal certification of products is mandatory. The mandatory provision of halal certification for business actors who produce food or enter food into Indonesia for trade should state that the food concerned is halal for Muslims. The Explanation of the Halal Product Guarantee Law states that halal information for a product is very important for the Indonesian people, the majority of whom adhere to Islam. The guarantee of the implementation of halal products also aims to provide comfort, security, safety and certainty of the availability of halal products for the community in consuming and using products (Kristiyanti, 2018). Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    243 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 The stipulation of Government Regulation No. 39 of 2021 dated February 2, 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Sector is a step to reform the implementation of Halal Product Guarantee in Indonesia. This regulation is a regulation that was born as a derivative of Law No. 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation which is expected to be a concrete step to simplify and harmonize business licensing, help create jobs for the community and empower MSMEs which are one of the backbones of the people's economy. However, this PP needs to be reviewed and criticized regarding several things. About the determination that the Halal Auditor is only limited to one Halal Examining Agency (LPH) considering that this profession is a rare profession that has certification, so that if the Halal Auditor is not limited to one LPH, the mechanism and process of licensing and obtaining halal certification can be easier and faster. In addition, this PP also still does not clearly provide information about the financing of conducting halal certification activities for micro entrepreneurs or giving its authority to the BPJPH Regulation. This is necessary so that there is legal certainty and consumer protection for micro and small business actors. 2. METHODS  The research method used is a qualitative approach, which is research conducted directly to the subject under study, descriptive in nature, to obtain data from the problem. Data sources for this research are obtained from Government Regulation No. 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Field, data collection is carried out through interviews, observation, and documentation, with data analysis techniques being data reduction, data presentation and conclusion drawing. The type of research that will be used is qualitative research, which is research that will then produce information in the form of notes and descriptive data contained in the text under study. By using descriptive qualitative research, the analysis method will provide clear, objective, systematic, analytical and critical information regarding the study of Halal Certification on Food and Beverage Products based on PP No. 39 of 2021. Research Method This type of research is socio-legal research. Sociological legal research, namely research that discusses: a. The application of positive law; b. The influence of the application of positive law on people's lives; c. The influence of non-legal factors on the formation of positive legal provisions; d. The influence of non-legal factors on the formation of positive legal provisions. Sociological legal research using a positive law implementation approach to Government Regulation PP No. 39 of 2021. The data sources used in this study are primary data, namely data obtained directly from the results of observations and interviews; secondary data, namely data obtained from scientific journals, legal literature, and laws and regulations; and Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    244 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 tertiary data, namely data that functions to support primary data and secondary data. The data collection techniques used in this study are observation, interviews, and literature studies. The data analysis technique used in this study is qualitative analysis, then concluded using the deductive method That in sociological legal research can be research that seeks to see the correlation between law and society. 3. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION Halal certification is a halal certification issued by the Institute for the Assessment of Food, Drugs and Cosmetics (LPPOM-MUI) which states that a product is in accordance with Islamic law. This halal certificate can be used to make halal labels. Law No. 33 of 2014 concerning Halal Product Guarantee attempts to resolve public concerns by providing clear rules regarding the issuance of halal certificates. Halal certificate itself is a form of recognition of the halalness of a product issued by BPJPH based on a written halal fatwa issued by MUI. Meanwhile, the halal label is a sign of the halalness of a product. Business actors who have obtained a halal certificate are required to include a halal label on their products according to the form of a halal label that applies nationally. Halal certification has many benefits for consumers, one of which is to provide peace of mind that the products consumed can be guaranteed and safe. This is certainly the goal of all consumers. Moreover, Muslim consumers who are ordered by Allah to consume halalan thoyiban products. For producers, halal certification has an impact on market winning in the global market because these products have added value as a way to compete with various existing competitors. Consumer trust will be easier to obtain if the product has halal certification, because of course halal-certified products are safe and guaranteed products. Here are some regulations governing halal products in Indonesia, among others (MUI, 2021): (Law) No. 33 of 2014 concerning Halal Product Guarantee. Government (PP) No. 31 of 2019 concerning Regulations for the Implementation of Law No. 33 of 2014 (JPH Law). Minister of Religious Affairs Regulation No. 26 of 2019 concerning the Implementation of Halal Product Guarantee. 4. Decree of the Minister of Religion (KMA) No. 982 of 2019 concerning Halal Certification Services. 5. Government Regulation (PP) No. 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Field. Halal certification involves 3 parties, namely BPJPH, LPPOM MUI as a halal inspection agency (LPH), and MUI. BPJPH carries out the implementation of halal product assurance. LPPOM MUI checks the adequacy of documents, schedules audits, conducts audits, conducts auditor meetings, issues audit memoranda, submits minutes of audit results at the MUI Fatwa Commission meeting. MUI through the Fatwa Commission determines the halalness of the product based on the audit results and issues the MUI Halal Decree (MUI, 2021). Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    245 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 he Government Regulation No. 39 of 2021, issued by the House of Representatives and the President of Indonesia, outlines the exemptions for Indonesia Halal certification. This regulation explains if a product is made from ingredients that are considered haram or prohibited in Islamic Law, it is exempted from the obligation to be Halal-certified.  Prohibited Products include: Alcoholic drinks (root beer, bailey\\u2019s whiskey, beer with 0% alcohol), Pork, dog, and its derivatives (hot dog, corn dog, ham, bacon), Symbols, images, names, words, or shapes of products that describe disobedience (Rawon Syaitan/Setan). Products that are made with any artificial flavor, citric acid, lecithin (Emulsifier). Haram products according to Islamic Law which include: Pigs, dogs, and animals that are not properly slaughtered or dead for a long time (carrion). Products that contain blood or blood products, such as blood sausage or blood pudding. Products that contain alcohol or other intoxicating substances, such as beer, wine, or liquor. Products that come from wild or fanged animals that are not domesticated, such as snakes, tigers, or sharks. Products that come from human body parts, such as skin or bones. The process for securing Indonesia Halal Certification for different business types. The Omnibus Law in Indonesia made Halal Certification mandatory for food, cosmetics, and medicinal products. According to this law, there are two types of certification processes depending on the size of the business; the general process (for large-scale businesses) and the self-declarative process (for MSMEs).  Indonesia\\u2019s Halal certification law, Government Regulation 39 of 2021 (GR 39/2021) which was issued in October 2021, will impact businesses in most industries. GR 39/2021 states that products that enter, circulate, and are traded in Indonesia must be Halal certified unless they are originating from materials prohibited under Islam (Haram).

Meanwhile, the 28 LHLNs signed up for the second type of agreement, among others the American Halal Foundation (AHF), ISWA Halal Certification Department, Islamic Services of America ISA, Halal Transactions Inc./Halal Transaction of Omaha, Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of Canada, and Halal Montreal Certification Authority Inc, (Agroberichtenbuitenland; 2023). Government Regulation Number 39 of 2021 concerning the implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee sector, based on Article 127 of PP Number 39 of 2021, imported products obtain halal certificates from foreign halal institutions. If you refer to the contents of this article, imported products are also required to obtain a halal certificate if they want to sell and market their products in Indonesia. Head of the Center for Halal Cooperation and Standardization of BPJPH of the Ministry of Religion (Kemenag), Siti Anisah, said that imported products can circulate in Indonesia if they have obtained halal certification. However, the halal certification mechanism for imported products is not the same as the halal certification of domestic products. Regarding foreign halal registration based on Article 127 of PP No.39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Field, imported Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    247 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 products get halal certificates from foreign halal institutions. So overseas halal institutions will cooperate. halal products whose halal certificates are issued by overseas institutions that have cooperated with mutual recognition of halal certificates with BPJPH do not need to apply for a halal certificate. As for halal certification with the category of raw materials, additional ingredients, auxiliary materials and slaughter results whose certificates are issued by foreign halal institutions that have cooperated with mutual recognition of halal certificates with BPJPH must be registered before being circulated in Indonesia. Cooperation in recognizing foreign halal certificates, First of course you have to make an agreement between countries in the form of G to G or Bilateral Agreement. After that, the overseas halal institution (LHLN) registers with SIHALAL and uploads the required documents. Government Regulation Number 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Sector is an implementing regulation that was born as a follow-up to Law Number 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation. It should be noted that Article 48 of Law Number 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation is the result of an amendment to the previous law, namely Law Number 33 of 2014 concerning Halal Product Guarantee. So automatically, Government Regulation Number 31 of 2019 concerning the Implementation of Halal Product Guarantee is no longer in effect and is replaced by Government Regulation Number 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Field. Currently, the latest regulation regarding halal product guarantee is article 48 of Law Number 11 concerning Job Creation, issued to amend 24 articles of Law Number 33 of 2014 concerning Halal Product Guarantee. Thus, overall Government Regulation Number 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Sector, the content is not much different from the previous Government Regulation. One of the changes that occurred was regarding the field of cooperation between the Halal Product Guarantee Agency (BPJPH) and the Indonesian Ulema Council.

Thus, overall Government Regulation Number 39 of 2021 concerning the Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    248 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Sector, the content is not much different from the previous Government Regulation. One of the changes that occurred was regarding the field of cooperation between the Halal Product Guarantee Agency (BPJPH) and the Indonesian Ulema Council. A Muslim is obliged to consume halal and thayyib. The halalness of a product is an urgent matter, because this intersects with the faith or spiritual life of a Muslim. The halalness of the product consumed by a Muslim refers to the permissibility or impermissibility of the product being used based on the guidance of the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad SAW. While the concept of thayyib means good, good, and clean, prioritizing product quality, cleanliness, health, nutritional content and safety. Muslim consumers need halal-certified products as well as safe and quality products. The stipulation of Government Regulation No. 39 of 2021 dated February 2, 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Sector is a step to reform the implementation of Halal Product Guarantee in Indonesia. This regulation is a regulation that was born as a derivative of Law No. 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation which is expected to be a concrete step to simplify and harmonize business licensing, help create jobs for the community and empower MSMEs which are one of the backbones of the people's economy. However, this PP needs to be reviewed and criticized regarding several things. About the determination that the Halal Auditor is only limited to one Halal Examining Agency (LPH) considering that this profession is a rare profession that has certification, so that if the Halal Auditor is not limited to one LPH, the mechanism and process of licensing and obtaining halal certification can be easier and faster. In addition, this PP also still does not clearly provide information about the financing of conducting halal certification activities for micro entrepreneurs or giving its authority to the BPJPH Regulation. This is necessary so that there is legal certainty and consumer protection for micro and small business actors. The Indonesian Halal Product Assurance Law (PP No. 39 Tahun 2021) regulates the halal certification process for food and beverages in Indonesia. This law mandates that all food, beverages, and other consumer goods distributed in Indonesia must be certified halal, ensuring they meet Islamic dietary requirements. Key points of PP No. 39 Tahun 2021 include: 1. Definition and Scope: Defines what constitutes halal and outlines the scope of products that require halal certification, including food, beverages, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other goods. 2. Certification Process: Establishes the Halal Product Assurance Agency (BPJPH) as the authority responsible for halal certification. Businesses must obtain certification from BPJPH or from certified halal auditors. Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    249 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 3. Obligations for Businesses: Requires businesses to register with BPJPH and obtain halal certification for their products before distributing them in Indonesia. This includes ensuring that the entire production process, including sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution, complies with halal requirements. 4. Imported Products: Imports must also be certified halal by the country of origin's authorized halal certification body or undergo halal certification in Indonesia through BPJPH. 5. Penalties and Enforcement: Specifies penalties for non-compliance and outlines enforcement mechanisms to ensure adherence to halal standards. 6. Consumer Rights: Protects consumers' rights to halal products and provides mechanisms for reporting non-compliance or issues related to halal certification. PP No. 39 Tahun 2021 aims to strengthen Indonesia's halal industry, ensure consumer confidence in halal products, and streamline the certification process through centralized regulation. The UMKs as the main economic and financial actors in Indonesia have a high enthusiasm to follow the process of halal certification against his treatments. Such animoes usually come from big food and beverage companies. For example, they are interested in their products being certified halal as a form of commitment to maintain confidence for their consumers. This halal product warranty program by some small and micro enterprises is considered to be overwhelming, both in terms of cost, small enterprises and microenterprises will be faced with problems in meeting the elements of food safety and sometimes also related to the process and place of its manufacture, because halal certification also requires a good and safe way of processing or production of food. This means that halal certification cannot be met without good food production methods or good manufacturing practices. This is because the UMKM perpetrators will take the process of halal certification and huge resources, besides they have to improve the production process. Because halal certification is not only halal, but also must thayyib and meet the standards of food processing rules that have been established. In terms of financing, this halal certificate has two elements, namely administrative costs and halal inspection costs administrative charges according to some of them are relatively affordable although some other assume that the registration costs ranging around millions of rupees it also imposes the Charges for halal inspections which the perpetrators of UMKM judged is very imposing, because the charges will include the costs for halal auditors, accommodation, etc. Based on data obtained from the official website of Kemag as of November 5, 2021 data of the BPJPH Halal Information System mentions that there are about 31.529 Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    250 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 authorities following to certify the validity of its products. This data is dominated by micro-enterprises followed by small enterprises, if in total 76% are UMK offenders (usaha mikro dan kecil). They mostly offer snacks, bread and cakes, drinks and processed products. If detailed in the big five are spice products, spices, condiments and spices. This demonstrates the high level of awareness of law enforcement, especially of UMKM perpetrators, about the importance of halal certification. Specifically for products to be marketed in the UAE and to be claimed valid, the auditor will check compliance with the implementation of the Hazard Analysis CriticalControl Point (HACCP) during the audit.  The Ministry of Religion as one of the members of the Shariah National Economic and Financial Committee (KNEKS) and the organizer of the Halal Product Guarantee (JPH) welcomed the program. The Ministry of Religion has also continued its efforts to meet its supporting factors, such as infrastructure to support Indonesia's achievement as a World Halal Producer Centre by 2024, as planned by the Vice President who is also the Chairman of the Shariah National Economic and Financial Committee. (KNEKS). Other efforts are also to unify the system of economic halal certification services with Online Single Submission (OSS) online through the SIHALAL website, simplifying the series of halal Certification measures that have been addressed in the Law No. 11 Year 2020 on Creating Jobs. The Ministry of Religion is also cooperating with the Ministry or other institutions such as the Finance Ministry, regarding the service charges in the General Service Agency of BPJPH, as well as free service for UMKM halal certification, including also with KNEKS with a focus on facilitating the certification of UMK halal. International cooperation has also continued to be pursued by the Ministry of Religion with several countries. This cooperation covers several parts such as the development of halal quality assurance, halal resources, technology in the field of halal and recognition of halal certificates in accordance with Article 119 PP No. 39 of 2021. This cooperation is also beneficial to the halal investment of foreign countries which will further foster the affinity of bilateral relations, recognition of halal products will be more acceptable. BPJPH provides a wide range of facilities for the process of registering halal certifications, applications and consultation of halal certification through SIHALALAL application can be done from anywhere online. This application is directly connected to the OSS so that for UMK perpetrators it is recommended to take care of the Enterprise Master Number (NIB) before applying for a halal certification so that when submitting a HALAL certification becomes easier and simpler because of the data connected with OSS.  According to BPJHP (Halal Product Guarantee Organizing Agency) Ministry of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia in 2023. The government provides funding and subsidy support as a way to open up public involvement. UMK offenders who Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    251 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 apply for a halal certificate are not charged. In 2020 and 2021, a number of ministries provided certification financing through halal certification facilitation program, such as the Ministry of Religion through BPJPH providing facilities to 3,200 UMK perpetrators free of charge. It is a form of cooperation carried out by the Ministry of Cooperation and SMEs, the Bank of Indonesia, the Ministries of Industry, the Department of Commerce, and the related providers of this facility.  In 2021 BPJPH has launched a joint program called SEHATI or free halal certification, Halal Product Guarantee Organizing Agency (BPJHP; 2023). The existence of services electronically is a support for the service base to be connected to the bottom. Continuous monitoring is carried out to maintain consistency of product validity, and is also related to the actions of the entrepreneurs who keep the quality of the product with continuously. In this case, BPJPH cooperates with LPH or other associated agencies in implementing continuous construction in the management and guarantee system of halal products. But the fact is that the problem lies in the food and beverage production process that is sensitive to the critical point (medium andhighrisk) of the materials used and also the processing process. It's related to the process of halal products that become the evaluation point of halal certification. The availability of materials and the production of halal products makes it very easy for entrepreneurs to ensure that the product is halal. Included in it when implementing this PP on the filing of extension of halal certification. This PP does not require the inclusion of a Halal Supplier report confirming that there are no changes in the PPH (Process of Halal Products) and the layout of the ingredients in the product. In addition to the clarity of raw materials and processes, halal certification adheres to the principles of traceability and authentication. Traceabiliy aims to determine where and how the production process is. Authentication as a guarantee of certainty that there is no ambiguity between halal products and non-halal products, no merging with illegal products into halal products through laboratory analysis. At this level, the impetus of our stakeholders is very urgent to ensure that the supply runs well and is available from the base to the end of the user of the product. The commitment of large and medium-sized producers in ensuring the validity of their products is a way out to deal with the difficulty of halal raw materials, especially for small industries such as meat, fried oil and so on. To support it all, it is vital that there is a development of research carried out by research institutions, colleges in support of industry including research on nonhalal alternatives to cosmetic products or medicines. The parties involved in the process of halal certification are Ormas and Islamic religious institutions, colleges, local governments, associations and so on. Especially in the halal self-declaration scheme provides simplification of licensing efforts and business processes. It is a form of ensuring that halal certification services are optimally prepared, internal consolidation and coordination as well as cross-Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    252 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 agency communication, including international cooperation guaranteeing halal products. Interesting issues about the validity of imported products entering Indonesia. During this time, halal certification of foreign products is carried out by business to business cooperation (B to B). However, with the Act 33 of 2014 and the Creation Act 11 of 2020, as well as PP No. 39 of 2021, international cooperation is built on the basis of mutual recognition and acceptance of legal certificates. (Mutual Recognition and Agreement, MRA). The existence of a halal certification body plays an important role in ensuring that foreign products entered Indonesia in accordance with validity standards. On the contrary, with mutual consent, halal products exported from Indonesia can also be accepted outside the country because there is already a common standard of halal. In Islamic law, the issue of certification and halal labelling is a new topic that has never been explicitly described in the Nash or the classical fikih books. The mention and discussion of food is placed in a special chapter, chapter al-at\\u2019imah (makanan). On the other hand, the processed foods that are emerging and developing today are not detailed. On the other hand, the various challenges that arise from the existence of science, technology, and industry in this modern era, affecting all layers of social structures bring about social and cultural change and transformation in various forms and variations. In addressing this issue, the Islamic Shariah must also provide interpretation and legal certainty on various issues in the field of food. Indonesia, home to the world\\u2019s largest Muslim population, has emerged as a pivotal player in the global halal industry. Targeting to become the world\\u2019s global Halal hub, the Indonesian government strives to ensure the availability of Halal products in the market. In organizing JPH, BPJPH cooperates with related ministries and/or institutions, the Halal Inspection Agency (LPH), the Halal Product Process Assistance Agency (LP3H), the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), and the Halal Product Fatwa Committee. BPJPH also carries out international cooperation in Halal Product Assurance. While domestically, BPJPH has also carried out a number of collaborations to strengthen the implementation of JPH with collaboration between BPJPH and related stakeholders, starting from Ministries/Institutions, local governments, BUMN, BUMD, universities, business associations, communities, community organizations (Ormas), training institutes, halal centers/halal study centers, and so on. BPJPH also continues to expand its synergy with various stakeholders to strengthen the implementation of JPH. BPJPH has made various strategic efforts and breakthroughs to accelerate product halal certification, while strengthening the halal ecosystem in Indonesia. The goal is Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    253 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 to realize Indonesia's vision of becoming the number 1 center for producing halal products in the world. (BPJH; 2023) In a significant move, the Indonesian government introduced Government Regulation 39 of 2021 (\\u201cHalal Certification Regulation\\u201d) on the implementation of Halal Product Assurance, mandating Halal certification for a wide range of goods and services. In addition to the Food and Beverage industry, this regulatory framework also encompasses consumables sectors, such as cosmetics, drugs, medical supplies and devices, clothing, office supplies, and household appliances \\u2013 including their ancillary businesses. To comply with this regulation, each product classification must obtain Halal certification within the stipulated timeframe, spanning from October 2024 to October 2034. Failure to comply with Halal Certification Regulation, businesses may be subject to administrative sanctions in the form of a written warning, administrative fine, revocation of halal certificate, and withdrawal of goods or services from the market. 4. CONCLUSION  Halal certification in Indonesia has been developing as the awareness of halal in the community is increasing. To guarantee the existence of halal products, especially food, cosmetics, and medicines, the government has enacted a Halal Product Guarantee Act. The certification which was initially the work area of MUI through the LPPOM, was then transferred to the BPJPH, which is an official government agency under the umbrella of the Ministry of Religion. There needs to be synergy and co-operation between the government, entrepreneurs, and the public in overseeing the circulation of products so that it can realize the guarantee of halal products in Indonesia.International cooperation is built on the basis of mutual recognition and acceptance of legal certificates. (Mutual Recognition and Agreement, MRA). The existence of a halal certification body plays an important role in ensuring that foreign products entered Indonesia in accordance with validity standards. On the contrary, with mutual consent, halal products exported from Indonesia can also be accepted outside the country because there is already a common standard of halal. In accordance with the provisions of Law No. 33 of 2014 on the Guarantee of Halal Products (JPH), products that enter, circulate and trade in the territory of Indonesia must be certified halal. Registration of halal certification through the Sihalal application that can be accessed at any time and from anywhere online for 24 hours, thus making it easier for entrepreneurs to apply for halal Certification. The entrepreneur also no longer has to bring the files of document requirements to the Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    254 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 BPJPH office, or PTSP in any Kanwil Kemenag or Kankemenag city/district throughout Indonesia.  The Government needs to revise Government Regulation No. 39 of 2021 on the Guarantee of Halal Products which is an enforcement regulation born as a follow-up to the Act No. 11 of 2020 on the Creation of Works which is the amendment of the previous Act, namely the Law No. 33 of 2014 on the guarantee of halal products. For entrepreneurs who want to prove the validity of their products or register their products must pass a valid and clear halal certification. REFERENCES Afroniyati, L. 2017.

Launched in 2012, it aims to set measurable sustainability targets involving all parts of the supply chain from farmers and processors through to food service and retail. The programme needs to be understood in the context of the work of Bord Bia (the Irish Food Board). This organisation was established in 1994 from a merger of the Irish Meat and Livestock Board and the food promotional activities of the Irish Trade Board, and later incorporated the horticultural and seafood sectors. Bord Bia\\u2019s primary function is to promote, assist and develop the marketing of Irish food and beverage products.Bord Bia receives approximately \\u20ac70 million in funding, representing about 0.5% of the \\u20ac14.5 billion value of Irish agri-food exports. The only non-governmental funding is from a statutory farmer levy of \\u20ac5.9 million. Most of Bord Bia\\u2019s income is used for marketing and promotions and the remainder is spent on specific projects and operating expenditure. A total of \\u20ac6.5 million is allocated to the Origin Green quality assurance schemes.Beef Quality Assurance Schemes and the measurement of carbon footprint The foundation of the Origin Green certification was the Irish beef quality assurance and traceability schemes, which have a long history in the Irish beef industry. They were originally developed in response to pressure from large retailers, as well as the outbreaks of bovine IRELAND\\u2019S ORIGIN GREEN SUSTAINABILITY BRAND  RELEVANCE FOR NEW ZEALAND\\u2019S BEEF INDUSTRYNIC LEESThis article reports on a study by the author on Ireland\\u2019s Origin Green sustainability brand. It looks at what it is, how it is implemented in the Irish beef industry and its relevance to New Zealand. Compared to Ireland, the study found the New Zealand beef industry has been slow to implement important programmes such as the measurement of farm-level carbon footprints, traceability and consistent quality assurance standards.THE JOURNAL SEPTEMBER 202126spongiform encephalopathy (1984-2008) and foot and mouth disease (2007). They set standards for traceability, food safety, hygiene, health and safety and animal welfare. The significant change to these quality assurance schemes with the introduction of the Origin Green programme was the addition of a farm-level measure of carbon footprint (Figure 1). Other sustainability measures included are water use efficiency, biodiversity and energy efficiency. This report focuses on the on-farm measurement of carbon footprint.The addition of a carbon footprint measurement was in response to several published studies on the impact of the livestock sector on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that questioned the sustainability credentials of the Irish beef production system. This highlighted the need to develop verifiable industry data to measure GHG emissions and establish a basis for demonstrating progress. The measurement of a farm-level carbon footprint uses the Carbon Navigator \\u2013 a tool developed by Teagasc (Agriculture and Food Development Authority). The carbon footprint scheme is certified by the internationally recognised Carbon Trust and utilises methodology aligned to specific standards \\u2013 GHG Protocol Product Standard PAS 2050 and ISO 14067. These methodologies use a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach and are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Food and drink manufacturers are independently verified by international auditors Mabbett and Associates.Implementation of the Origin Green carbon footprint measurement To measure carbon footprint, data is collated from several different sources. This includes the Department of Agriculture\\u2019s Animal Identification and Movement System (AIMS), the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) database and slaughter weights from the beef processors. Additional data is also collected from Bord Bia\\u2019s Quality Assurance audit, which requires farmers to record information on all farm inputs and outputs. Following each audit, the farmer receives a sustainability report showing the results and feedback on the farm\\u2019s performance, with reassessments every 18 months. This report identifies areas that can improve the carbon footprint of their farms by evaluating key efficiency areas. These include extended grazing, calving rate, daily live weight gain, improved Economic Breeding Index (EBI), nitrogen efficiency, slurry management and energy efficiency.Figure 1: Reductions in on-farm CO2 emissions 2014-2018Source: Origin Green Progress Update ReportFollowing each audit, the farmer receives a sustainability report showing  the results and feedback on the farm's performance, with reassessments every 18 months.THE JOURNAL SEPTEMBER 202127Importance of Origin Green in the marketplaceOrigin Green aims to be an umbrella for all that the Irish food and beverage industry is doing in the sustainability space. Beef industry leaders have stated that the carbon footprint data is important because it enables the beef industry to measure and demonstrate its environmental credentials. Like New Zealand, Ireland has always traded on its \\u2018green\\u2019 island environment. However, the Irish beef industry found that this perception is no longer sufficient and they now need to demonstrate this is true. Origin Green is seen as a way of future-proofing the sector and ensuring Irish beef continues to be competitive in a changing environment. Farmer perceptions of Origin GreenFrom a market perspective, farmers have said it is difficult to evaluate the impact of the Origin Green brand, especially for returns at the farm gate. They are aware that the Irish industry is dependent on large retail customers such as Tesco and McDonalds and therefore they set the rules. As a result, farmers felt Origin Green has become a standard they require rather than something that provides a premium. Those who are closer to the market through involvement with branded products, such as Hereford or Angus, are more positive about the benefits. Some farmers are also concerned that all farmers are treated equally and there is no premium for those who have a lower carbon footprint.Most farmers commented on the significant additional information required for carbon footprint measurements. Many considered this to be time-consuming and not very relevant to their farm business. However, with increasing environmental regulations there is greater acceptance of the need to record and demonstrate environmental sustainability measures. Some highlighted the benefit of the report in identifying areas where they could be more efficient. This seemed to be a more important motivation than specific environmental concerns. Outcomes for the Irish beef industryAlthough Origin Green may not have achieved all of its primary goals, there are several positive outcomes for the Irish beef industry:\\u2022 The programme has taken a proactive approach to the environmental impacts of beef production and in particular carbon emissions. Origin Green introduced the farm-level carbon footprint measurement in 2012, which was well ahead of any other beef-producing Origin Green in-market promotionWith increasing environmental regulations there is greater acceptance of the need to record and demonstrate environmental sustainability measures.THE JOURNAL SEPTEMBER 202128country. This provided evidence that the industry was taking its environmental impacts seriously and was trying to address its sustainability issues \\u2022 It has been able to produce independently verifiable data with which to engage in the debate on the impact of beef production on the environment. Without this, the industry would be vulnerable to data produced from outside the beef industry and would not be able to question the validity of these studies\\u2022 It has identified some key areas where farmers can make changes to their production system that improve both environmental outcomes and farm efficiency\\u2022 It has helped the industry engage with stakeholders, especially the large retail customers such as Tesco and McDonalds, and supports them with their own sustainability agenda. This has helped keep Irish beef in a competitive position in markets where there is strong competition from local beef.Relevance to New ZealandDespite some of the challenges in implementing Origin Green, there are significant lessons relevant to New Zealand\\u2019s efforts to verify and communicate its sustainability credentials. Bord Bia and the Origin Green programme have enabled the Irish beef industry to be proactive about traceability, quality assurance, measuring GHG emissions and promoting its sustainability brand. It has also been able to extend this across all its food and beverage exports. In this respect, Ireland is well ahead of New Zealand. Carbon footprintNew Zealand does not have an equivalent food sustainability programme that includes a farm-level carbon footprint measurement. This is currently under development, but is still several years away from being fully implemented.For example. the Beef + Lamb New Zealand Environment Strategy and Implementation Plan aims to have a system for farm-level accounting and reporting of agricultural emissions in place at the farm level by 2025. Another document that outlines the commitment of primary sector industries to mitigate climate change is He Waka Eke Noa \\u2013 Our Future In Our Hands: Primary Sector Climate Change Commitment, which proposes that all farms will have an emissions reporting system in place by 2025. This highlights how New Zealand tends to respond to government regulation rather taking a proactive approach. TraceabilityIreland has had animal traceability systems and quality assurance schemes in place since the 1980s. In the Irish scheme any animal can be located through its ear tag. It is a legal requirement that every time an animal moves, farmers are required to enter the new location of the animal in the system.Irish grass-based  beef productionDespite some of the challenges in implementing Origin Green, there are significant lessons relevant to New Zealand's efforts to verify and communicate its sustainability credentials.THE JOURNAL SEPTEMBER 202129In contrast, the New Zealand National Animal Identification and Tracing (NAIT) scheme was introduced in 2012. There was considerable opposition from farmers and farmer organisations who saw it as an additional cost on their business for no tangible gain. They were also concerned about the privacy of data and how government agencies might use this. As a result, the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) introduced the scheme with no mandatory recording. It was not until the recent incursion of Mycoplasma bovis that serious deficiencies in the traceability system were identified. Since then, there has been a major review of NAIT with a number of the recommendations implemented to strengthen the system. Quality assuranceNew Zealand has also been behind Ireland with its quality assurance schemes for beef and lamb. The New Zealand Farm Assurance Programme (NZFAP) introduced in 2017 was the first comprehensive industry-standard farm assurance programme. Before this, farmers had to meet the requirements of multiple farm assurance schemes, depending on the specific processor or customer requirements. Many of these schemes were similar, but often required multiple audits on the one farm.New Zealand beef industry brandingIn contrast to the Irish industry the New Zealand red meat sector has struggled to develop a coordinated Beef + Lamb New Zealand Taste Pure Nature brandindustry strategy or national branding programme that provides verifiable sustainability measures or has the ability to communicate the unique characteristics of our natural production systems. Recent initiatives, such as the Beef + Lamb New Zealand Taste Pure Nature, aim to address this but with limited resources and only in select markets. Potential for a New Zealand national sustainability brandDespite the shortcomings of Origin Green, it highlights the opportunity for New Zealand to develop a similar sustainability brand. It also shows the potential to extend this beyond just the beef industry and bring together all New Zealand\\u2019s food exports. Furthermore, the Irish experience has highlighted the need for an agency or organisation to provide leadership across the food sector to implement change. Without this leadership it is likely that this country will continue to struggle to introduce a unified food strategy or respond to the repeated calls for a New Zealand food sustainability brand.AcknowledgementsThe project was partly funded by AGMARDT.

The chapter methodically reviews typical food processing stages, from \\nrecipe development through to end product supply, and considers how sensory \\nassessment methods can be utilised to help assure the quality of the end products \\nwithin these selected high-risk chilled food sectors.\\nKey words: sensory analysis, organoleptic assessment, key sensory points (KSPs), \\nquality assurance, quality control, taste panel, ready meals, soups, sauces.\\n11.1 Introduction\\nMulti-component foods such as ready meals, soups and sauces by their very \\nnature comprise a diverse range of ingredients. The final quality of the foods \\nproduced will typically be heavily influenced by the quality of these raw \\nmaterials and the consistency of the production processes involved. With \\nparticular regard to these factors, sensory assessment has a key role to play \\nin ensuring product quality at each stage of the food manufacturing opera-\\ntion. This chapter considers the many development and processing stages \\nof a typical rea y meal, soup or sauce manufacturing operation and pro-\\nvides detail upon the use of sensory assessment within each phase of the \\nproduction process.\\nIt should be noted that during the manufacture of food products there \\nare usually many checks that have to be conducted to help ensure product \\nsafety, quality and legality. This chapter particularly seeks to focus upon the \\nuse of sensory evaluation within the quality assurance (QA) aspects of food \\nproduction. A reputable food manufacturing business QA system will view \\nKIL11.indd   203 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n204 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nsensory evaluation as one of many useful tools to be utilised in the monitor-\\ning and control of product quality, safety and legality throughout the manu-\\nfacturing operation. The reader is therefore encouraged to consider how \\nsuch checks may complement the QA system of their own manufacturing \\noperation.\\n11.2 Sensory quality assurance (QA) in the recipe \\ndevelopment process\\nRecipe creation and development within a multi-component food produc-\\ntion business are typically the role of a new product development (NPD) \\ndepartment. This department is often considered to be the lifeblood of a \\nbusiness as the extent of customer acceptance of its new product creations \\nwill be reflected in the total sales of the business. A very high proportion \\nof the customer\\u2019s engagement with food products is based upon organolep-\\ntic factors (e.g. appearance, aroma, taste and texture) and therefore it is \\nvital that the NPD department utilises a wide range of sensory skills and \\ntechniques in order to create products which will satisfy the expectations \\nof the end consumer.\\nIt is generally accepted that consumers will have subjective reactions to \\nfood products and describe new foods in terms of their \\u2018likes\\u2019 and \\u2018dislikes\\u2019, \\nwhereas food manufacturing operations will often benefit from objectivity \\nin identifying and defining sensory attributes. By combining consumer reac-\\ntions with well-defined sensory attributes it is possible to gain an insight \\ninto those foods which have attributes that consumers will accept and those \\nwhich the consumer will reject.\\nSuch skills at the NPD stage include the ability to be able to physically \\ncreate the product envisaged and this skill is greatly helped by experience. \\nOnce the required product sensory characteristics (including appearance, \\naroma, taste and texture) have been clearly defined, the development chef \\ncan then reflect upon how other products with similar characteristics are \\nmade. Such an approach will often help to then define the ingredient list \\nand the likely production process for the new product.\\nThese skills will certainly help during the following typical NPD \\nscenarios:\\n\\u2022 Blue-sky creativity: sometimes during the development process the \\nNPD team will dream-up ideas for new products, utilising their sensory \\nskills to then create the product which has been envisaged. This is a skill \\nthat can take years to refine, and the process is greatly supported by an \\nability to define and then achieve the desired product sensory \\nattributes.\\n\\u2022 Customer brief: often the business NPD team will receive a \\u2018brief\\u2019/\\ndescription from the customer upon the type of product or product \\nKIL11.indd   204 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 205\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nrange they are interested in procuring. Sometimes these briefs can be \\nextremely detailed, providing the desired key sensory points (KSPs) for \\neach individual recipe, and other times the \\u2018customer brief\\u2019 may only \\noutline a general range of products required and just state the product \\nnames or target consumer groups, in which case the NPD team has a \\nwide degree of artistic licence to formulate product samples designed to \\ngain the customer\\u2019s business.\\n\\u2022 \\u2018Me too\\u2019/\\u2018copycat\\u2019 approach: sometimes the customer or internal busi-\\nness drive will wish to move into a product category/market that already \\nhas the product types in it that they also wish to sell. In such cases busi-\\nnesses will often take product samples of the competition, carry out \\nwell-structured benchmarking sessions, decide upon suitable production \\nmethods for each product, and ideally find a way to make the products \\nbetter than the competition and at a lower cost. Usually in such circum-\\nstances the NPD team will have the added benefit of being able to \\nreview the food packaging label of the product that they are seeking to \\ncopy, and therefore may benefit from knowled e of aspects such as the \\ningredient declarations and nutritional data of the competitors \\nproducts.\\nDuring the NPD process there are a number of techniques that can be \\nutilised to aid the selection of the best products/recipes. These techniques \\ninclude the following:\\n\\u2022 Difference testing: selected business sensory evaluation panel members \\nare each in isolation (to avoid any influence) presented with a set of \\nindividually labelled product samples (typically three), all at the same \\ntime. One sample is different from the other two (i.e. the single sample \\nmay be a proposed new recipe version or the current standard recipe), \\nand the panellists are asked to pick out which sample is different. The \\nresults of the panel will inform the business whether there is an actual \\nconsistently distinguishable difference between the current recipe and \\nthe proposed new recipe.\\n\\u2022 Preference testing or \\u2018consumer testing\\u2019 has limited use in the early \\nstages of the NPD function, but is vital once a product has been devel-\\noped to guage consumer reaction to the new product. Members of the \\nbusiness sensory assessment panel are individually presented with \\nsamples of the current and the proposed new recipe (which are \\nunmarked to ensure that it is unclear which is which) and are asked \\nto select the sample which they prefer. It should be noted that when \\nselecting such a testing method the manager should ensure that it is \\nappropriate for the recipe being assessed. For example, the product \\nbeing assessed may be for eventual sale as an accompaniment to a \\nproduct (e.g. a pour-over sauce for steak), and in such circumstances \\nthe benefits of assessing the product in the context of its end use should \\nbe considered.\\nKIL11.indd   205 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n206 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nWhilst evaluating a proposed new recipe it is important to understand \\nyour customer and the aspects of the product that particularly matter to \\nthem (i.e. the KSPs of the product). Such an approach will help keep the \\nNPD team focused upon delivering specifically what the customer wants.\\n\\u2022 Customer panels can be used to help define the product KSPs (e.g. \\nappearance, aroma, taste, texture) and thereby ensure a business that \\nthe products being developed are likely to meet with the approval of \\nthe end consumer once launched. Customer panels can utilise sensory \\nevaluation techniques including acceptance/preference testing, focus \\ngroups, central location testing and product placement or can simply \\nrequest the panellist to taste the product and state what they like and \\nwhat they dislike about the product, and ultimately would they purchase \\nthe product at the price that it is intended to be sold for?\\nSometimes it will be of benefit to ensure that the consumer panellists \\nselected have experience of regularly eating the product types to be \\ntested in order to ensure that their assessment is very finely focused \\nupon the product KSPs. As a minimum requirement consumers should \\nbe non-rejectors of the product, and ideally they should be current users \\nof the product.\\n\\u2022 \\u2018Old product development\\u2019 (OPD) is a process in which the develop-\\nment team is tasked with making particular improvements/adjustments \\nto existing \\u2018live\\u2019 product recipes. These \\u2018improvements\\u2019 may often be \\nrelated to aspects of product quality or cost (e.g. seeking a sales margin \\nincrease) and such work is an important phase of the product life cycle \\nin terms of protecting product sales/operating margins. OPD also is \\noften required as businesses seek to review their product ranges to meet \\nthe increasing customer requirements for healthier foods; for example, \\nwhen seeking to develop product nutritional claims such as \\u2018reduced fat\\u2019 \\nor \\u2018reduced salt\\u2019.\\n11.3 Sensory quality assurance (QA) in the  \\npost-development product scale-up\\nSensory assessment plays an important role within the product scale-up \\nphase as it is vital to ensure that the product when manufactured on a full \\nindustrial scale still achieves all of the KSPs of the approved development \\nsample (as this is what the end customer will have agreed and therefore \\nwill be expecting to be delivered as the final product). All too often during \\nfactory trials of a new product there are problems encountered when trying \\nto match the factory product to the development kitchen samples which \\nhave been approved by the customer.\\nThe following are aspects of the scale-up process that can impact upon/\\ncause variations in the organoleptic properties of the factory-produced \\nproduct when compared to the development kitchen sample:\\nKIL11.indd   206 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 207\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\n\\u2022 Ingredients purchased on an industrial scale are typically not as \\u2018quality \\nconsistent\\u2019 as the development kitchen purchased and hand-prepared \\ningredients. Perhaps the \\u2018industrial scale supply\\u2019 meat/vegetable particu-\\nlates contain more \\u2018off-cuts\\u2019 or \\u2018fines\\u2019 which affect the appearance of the \\nend product. When preparing product samples for agreement with the \\ncustomer, the development department should be encouraged to always \\nuse factory grade ingredients, as using hand-selected \\u2018perfect\\u2019 ingredi-\\nents should be done only if such standards are consistently achievable \\nby the supplier at the price point intended. The exception to this may \\nsometimes be the use of hand-selected samples for product artwork, \\nalthough care must be taken not to mislead the consumer at this stage. \\nIf such points are not controlled then the business is likely to over-\\npromise and under-deliver in terms of product quality/consistency.\\n\\u2022 Production factors such as mixing/blending/cooking/holding times on an \\nindustrial scale in the factory typically take far longer than when making \\na very small quantity of product in the development kitchen. Such condi-\\ntions can lead to an increased potential for product texture breakdown, \\ncolour deterioration and flavour changes. The technologist who oversees \\nthe scale-up operation should select the best factory methods to mini-\\nmise such issues, make recommendations for more appropriate pieces \\nof equipment and limit maximum batch sizes wherever processing time \\nhas an adverse impact upon product organoleptic quality.\\n\\u2022 The development sample may only have been cooked to a very limited \\nextent in order to preserve texture, colour and flavour. However, in the \\nfull industrial process the product will also need to achieve certain shelf-\\nlife aspirations which often involve having to cook the product at higher \\ntemperatures or for longer periods of time in order to ensure a sufficient \\nlevel of microbiological reduction. Clearly there is therefore the poten-\\ntial for a reduction of organoleptic quality whilst seeking to achieve \\nproduct safety/shelf-life. As product safety is a non-negotiable product \\nrequirement, the scale-up technologist must ensure that the process and \\noperating times/temperatures selected achieve the required levels of \\nsafety and shelf-life whilst avoiding unacceptable levels of product \\norganoleptic deterioration caused by over-processing.\\n11.3.1 Shelf-life assessment\\nShelf-life assessment will typically involve holding the new product within \\nstorage and handling conditions that reflect both the product supply chain \\nand the holding conditions of the end consumer (most retailers/food service \\noperations will have pre-set criteria detailing the expected times, tempera-\\ntures and storage conditions of the shelf-life trials required for any products \\nwhich are to be sold through their operations). Shelf-life testing usually \\nrequires both microbiological and organoleptic assessment over the course \\nof the required shelf-life period (in some cases nutritional analysis will also \\nKIL11.indd   207 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n208 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nbe required to ensure that the nutritional performance of the product is as \\nrequired over shelf-life).\\nOften during the shelf-life assessment of a proposed new product, \\nsamples of the product will be despatched to a contract microbiology labo-\\nratory to be held at the required temperatures for the designated amounts \\nof time between microbiological tests. The storage temperatures during \\nsuch trials for chilled foods will usually be elevated to reflect the typically \\nhigher temperature storage conditions within the distribution chain and \\nconsumer storage (compared with the relatively low and consistent storage \\ntemperatures achievable within a closely controlled business chill store). It \\ncan sometimes be the product organoleptic performance that limits the \\ntotal product shelf-life rather than the overall product microbiological per-\\nformance. Therefore it is important to ensure that the organoleptic assess-\\nment of the product during shelf-life testing evaluates product samples that \\nhave been held in the same storage conditions (e.g. times and temperatures) \\nas the microbiological test samples.\\nTo aid process efficiencies and reduce wastage there will often be busi-\\nness commercial pressures to apply as long a shelf-life to products as is \\npossible. In such circumstances it can be tempting for a business to conduct \\nits shelf-life testing using \\u2018best case\\u2019/optimum storage conditions. However, \\nfailure to take account of \\u2018worst case\\u2019 or even just \\u2018real world\\u2019 storage con-\\nditions/factors may well lead to a business applying a length of shelf-life to \\nproducts which is based upon optimum storage control, rather than the real \\nworld storage conditions that the product is actually going to encounter \\nwithin the supply chain. Application of an inappropriately long shelf-life \\nmay result in consumer complaints of product deterioration before the \\u2018use \\nby\\u2019 date of the product has been reached and can lead to serious consumer \\nhealth issues and product recalls based upon product quality or safety \\ngrounds.\\nOften the simplest approach is to have the microbiological laboratory \\nhold both the microbiological and the organoleptic shelf-life test samples \\nwithin their storage incubators set at the required temperatures for the \\nrequired amounts of time. Each time a product is due for microbiological \\nassessment (at set points over the length of shelf-life to be assessed) the \\nlaboratory should also return the required number of samples back to the \\nmanufacturer for organoleptic shelf-life evaluation.\\nIt is also prudent to assess product shelf-life performance to a point \\nwhich is past the length of shelf-life that will be typically applied to the \\nproduct. Not only is this good practice in demonstrating due diligence that \\nthe shelf-life applied also allows for a margin of safety, but also by conduct-\\ning such tests the business will gain an understanding of the product char-\\nacteristics/features which are exhibited by the product as it deteriorates. In \\naddition there may be times in the future when the business would benefit \\nfrom an understanding of how long the product can actually last (e.g. \\nperhaps helpful in circumstances when the customer has queried the poten-\\nKIL11.indd   208 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 209\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\ntial for a shelf-life extension due to excess stock holding) and therefore \\nhaving already conducted such tests will prove to be invaluable in enabling \\na swift response.\\n11.4 Sensory quality assurance (QA) in  \\nthe production process\\n11.4.1 Definition of the required product organoleptic quality standard\\nThe end goal of the production process is to create a product which meets \\nthe customer\\u2019s expectations. Typically within the food manufacturing sector \\na sensory specification/standard for each product is used to aid product \\nquality assessment. The product profile of organoleptic expectations is often \\nwritten and agreed with the end customer at the time of product develop-\\nment or scale-up.\\nThis sensory description for each product should clearly define the spe-\\ncific organoleptic characteristics required to be achieved. This information \\nis usually defined under sections including appearance, aroma, taste and \\ntexture (Fig. 11.1). Photographs of the product can also be incorporated \\nwithin such sensory descriptions to further define the visual standard \\nrequired.\\nOne issue with regard to the use of end product sensory descriptions is \\nthat at certain stages within the production process the product may require \\nsensory assessment but will not yet be expected to meet the end product \\nsensory description. For example, pre-fried onions may require an organo-\\nleptic assessment to confirm that they are sufficiently soft and caramelised \\nprior to their addition to the sauce component of a chicken tikka masala \\nready meal. Therefore \\u2018intermediary stage\\u2019 sensory descriptions may be of \\nbenefit to the quality assurance of such product components. Often these \\nsensory descriptions are written by the process technologist responsible for \\nthe scale-up of the product, as the technologist will know the performance \\ncriteria required of the component at this specific process stage.\\n11.4.2 Production process sensory evaluation techniques and useful \\nequipment for product assessment\\nThe following section seeks to describe the many sensory related checks \\nthat can be conducted as part of a QA programme within a food manufac-\\nturing operation. Businesses will typically select particular sensory assess-\\nments and check frequencies based upon their staff and time resources \\navailable, the potential for product variability and the scale of the financial/\\nbusiness consequences of failure to supply to the quality specification \\nrequired.\\nSensory evaluation of ingredients and end products within the produc-\\ntion processes of ready meals, soups and sauces often relies heavily upon \\nKIL11.indd   209 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n210 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nFig. 11.1 Example product sensory description/check-sheet.\\nthe organoleptic assessment skills of the production operatives and super-\\nvisory staff.

The \\nBostwick consistometer (Fig. 11.2) determines the food sample consistency \\nby measuring the distance which the material flows under its own weight \\nover a set period of time. This enables the assessment of liquid food samples \\nagainst pre-set consistency/viscosity standards.\\nIt should be noted when using such equipment that product viscosity will \\nvary with product temperature. Typically the hotter the product, the less \\nviscous it will be. Such checks should therefore always be conducted at a set \\ntemperature point. Usually manufacturers will choose a set temperature \\nclose to the temperature that the product is likely to be at that point of \\nassessment. For example a pasteurised sauce to be assessed at the stage of \\ncooked batch completion may be assessed at 80 \\u00b0C, whereas a cold blend \\nsauce to be assessed at the point of batch completion may be assessed at \\n4 \\u00b0C. To ensure accuracy a calibrated hand probe should be used to confirm \\nthat the product is at the required temperature at the point of assessment.\\nAnother point of potential variation in results is that when assessing \\nsoups and sauces which contain particulates, the amount of particulates in \\neach small test sample will affect the flow rate/viscosity of the product. \\nTherefore it is common business practice, when assessing the viscosity of \\nparticulate sauces/soups, to always conduct a \\u2018sieved Bostwick\\u2019 where the \\nsample is sieved through a set size sieve to remove the particulates before \\nviscosity assessment in order to eliminate the \\u2018particulate variable\\u2019.\\nKIL11.indd   211 3/12/2010   7:55:50 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n212 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nBrookfield viscometer\\nBrookfield viscometer (Fig. 11.3) are often used within the food processing \\nsectors where accurate bench-top analysis of product viscosity is needed. \\nBrookfield Viscometers use the principle of \\u2018rotational viscometry\\u2019, i.e. \\ntheir measurement of product viscosity is based upon immersing a specifi-\\ncally selected spindle within a sample of the product followed by measure-\\nment of the torque required to rotate the spindle at a set speed whilst \\nimmersed within the product sample.

Many food companies now rely on photo-\\ngraphic standards for colour assessments and often these standards will be \\nreviewed on the computer screen at the relevant food manufacturing \\nwork-station.\\nIn addition to supporting in-house process control, the use of specific test \\nequipment also enables the manufacturing operation to communicate and \\nwork to a common standard with suppliers/customers, helping to ensure \\nthat quality standards for raw material supply and end product acceptance \\nare clearly and objectively defined.\\n11.4.3 Ingredients\\nThere are a number of steps that can be taken to help achieve the consistent \\nsupply of correct quality ingredients to the food manufacturing operation. \\nThe use of \\u2018approved suppliers\\u2019 (where the supplier is assessed for control \\nof aspects such as product quality, safety and legality prior to being autho-\\nrised to supply) is a good start to the assurance of consistent ingredient \\nsupply.\\nPurchase to a pre-agreed ingredient specification which reflects the \\nquality performance requirements of the ingredient is an important factor. \\nBy having a clear understanding and definition of the intended end product \\nKSPs, checks can then focus upon ensuring that the ingredient KSPs are \\naligned with the end product specification.\\nDefinition of ingredient KSPs will include written description of the \\nsensory aspects of the ingredient, including its appearance, aroma, taste and \\ntexture. These specified KSPs can then be checked to confirm conformance \\nto requirements upon point of delivery. Consistent ingredient supply is \\nhighly reliant upon consistent processes and machinery at the supplier site; \\ntherefore, where possible supplier audits should seek to review the sup-\\nplier\\u2019s ability to achieve a consistently correct ingredient quality.\\nSensory assessment of incoming ingredients should be conducted by a \\nmember of staff who has been trained upon such checks and confirmed to \\nbe capable of reviewing each ingredient against its specified quality criteria. \\nThese checks may include raw or cooked product tests in order to confirm \\nthat the ingredient\\u2019s appearance, aroma, taste and texture meet the require-\\nments defined within the specification/sensory description.\\nIt is always important to ensure that a representative sample is taken \\nfrom the incoming goods to be assessed. Staff can be trained upon sampling \\namounts and techniques to ensure that various points of the delivery are \\nchecked (including coverage of the range of supplier lot/batch/date codes \\npresent).\\nWhere cook tests are required (for example for the organoleptic assess-\\nment of raw meats) it is important to ensure that appropriate assessment \\nKIL11.indd   214 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 215\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nfacilities/cooking equipment are consistently available to the operator, oth-\\nerwise there is a risk that checks will not be conducted. Also such tests can \\nbe time consuming and therefore it is important to ensure that operators \\nare trained to focus upon the checks and do not rush.\\nSensory related checks upon incoming ingredients include the \\nfollowing:\\n\\u2022 Vegetables (typically assessed raw unless cook rate/texture is a critical \\nfactor to check in advance of processing): size (including dice or slice \\ndimensions if applicable), texture, taste, aroma, colour, skin presence, \\nextraneous matter and soil presence.\\n\\u2022 Meats (typically visually assessed in a raw state, and then fully organo-\\nleptically assessed upon cooking): aroma, size (including dice, slice or \\nmince dimensions), visual lean, texture, colour, blood, gristle and extra-\\nneous matter.\\n\\u2022 Dairy products: colour, aroma, viscosity and taste.\\nFood manufacturers should consider the pro-active benefits of encourag-\\ning their suppliers to conduct pre-outload sensory assessment of the raw \\nmaterials, in order that by the time the ingredient reaches the manufactur-\\ning site it has already received a recent confirmatory check that it meets all \\nof the sensory criteria expected. Such a \\u2018right first time\\u2019 approach can help \\navoid a lot of disruption and cost to both operations.\\nA relevant point of note is to ensure that when agreeing a specified \\nstandard for ingredient assessment pre-despatch (at the supplier site) and \\nupon arrival at your manufacturing site, the same design/model of testing \\nequipment should ideally be used at both sites to help reduce the potential \\nfor variances in the testing approach taken. Also the test methods/condi-\\ntions need to be stipulated to ensure consistency between the two sites; for \\nexample, product viscosity will be affected by temperature and therefore \\nshould always be measured at a pre-agreed temperature to facilitate \\ncomparison.\\nOver time a business may wish to vary its frequency of checks upon each \\ningredient, with the extent of assessment dependent upon the supplier track \\nhistory of consistency of supply, the potential for major product/business \\nimpact in the event of a fault, and some ingredients may require extra focus \\nupon particular \\u2018at risk\\u2019 times of year with regard to consistency/seasonality \\nof supply. For example small dice/slice sizes of fresh processed carrots, \\nbecause of their high surface area, can be far more susceptible to spoilage \\nat certain times of the year. Such spoilage can result in an acidic flavour/\\naroma which, if the \\u2018off\\u2019 carrots were then accidentally used, would render \\nthe end product unsalable. As a consequence manufacturers may choose to \\nreduce the operating shelf-life of such ingredients at particular \\u2018known \\nissue\\u2019 times of year. It is often useful to build up a catalogue of these poten-\\ntial supply issues that can be used within a food production business for \\nstaff training and advanced warning purposes.\\nKIL11.indd   215 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n216 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nOften manufacturers will conduct incoming goods checks in the area \\nin which they are going to store the product as long delays whilst con-\\nducting checks in ambient conditions can have an adverse effect upon \\nboth the organoleptic and microbiological properties of chilled/frozen \\ningredients.\\n11.4.4 Ingredient supply changes, cost improvement initiatives and \\ningredient substitutions\\nThere can be many circumstances which will drive a business to replace a \\ncurrently supplied ingredient with another. Perhaps the supplier is unable \\nto achieve the consistency of supply required due to the order volumes \\nbeing too small, too big or too infrequent. Perhaps there s a business initia-\\ntive to improve the nutritional status of the end product (e.g. reduced salt \\nor reduced fat projects). Another potential reason is that of \\u2018cost control\\u2019 \\nor \\u2018margin protection\\u2019, where a cheaper supply is therefore being sought. \\nAlso there is the possibility that the usual manufacturing site unexpectedly \\ndoes not have the ingredient available and therefore the business needs to \\nuse a substitute ingredient in order to avoid significant disruption in their \\nproduction/delivery plan.\\nIt is important to highlight at this stage that when seeking to make \\nadjustments to the ingredients used a business must ensure that it is in \\ncontrol of key factors such as ingredient declaration changes, any food \\nsafety/allergen status changes and impacts upon end product specifications/\\ncustomer approval. Changes in some ingredient characteristics which ini-\\ntially appear to be minor, can sometimes make the difference between the \\nend product being safe or unsafe. For example when evaluating a new \\nchopped tomato product for use as a base ingredient within fresh, cold-\\nblended salsa sauces/dips, if the new chopped tomato supply is not as acidic \\nas the previously used ingredient then there is the significant potential that \\nthe resultant end product will not be as acidic and will therefore be more \\nsusceptible to spoilage and potentially pathogen presence/growth.\\nWhen considering proposed new ingredients it is also important to \\nensure that the end product quality is not going to be adversely affected by \\nany such ingredient changes and therefore, in advance of progression to \\nfactory trials of any new ingredient, sample assessment using sensory evalu-\\nation techniques can help to ensure that the proposed new ingredient is \\nlikely to be successful.\\nThere is the temptation for suppliers to provide perfect hand-selected \\nsamples at the initial sales phases which can sometimes give an unrealistic \\nimpression of the quality and consistency of the ingredient to be supplied. \\nIt is therefore important to always request factory-produced samples from \\nthe suppliers of proposed new ingredients to ensure that the product being \\nassessed is representative of the product to be supplied on an ongoing \\nbasis.\\nKIL11.indd   216 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 217\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nOrganoleptic assessment of the proposed new ingredient against the \\nrequired ingredient specification and against a sample drawn from the \\ncurrent supply is a typical approach used by businesses when evaluating \\nthe adequacy of a proposed new ingredient. Such checks are usually con-\\nducted by a company panel, consisting of staff who have confirmed their \\ncompetence in sensory evaluation (often quality and development staff), \\nand involve the review (uncooked or cooked as appropriate) of aspects such \\nas ingredient appearance, aroma, taste and texture (and also viscosity \\nassessment for liquid products).\\nIn business often there can be resistance to change. Some staff will have \\ntheir preferred suppliers, perhaps due to relationships that have been built \\nover many years of supply. Other staff may be influenced by thoughts that \\nif a proposed new ingredient is cheaper then it cannot possibly be as good \\nas the currently supplied ingredient. Staff may be risk averse, feeling that \\nany changes may have the potential to damage the end product/business \\nreputation.\\nIn order to avoid such matters from clouding the fair evaluation of an \\ningredient, drawing together an ingredient sensory evaluation panel and \\napplying \\u2018Difference testing\\u2019 or \\u2018Preference testing\\u2019 methods can be used \\nto overcome any bias and provide objective rather than subjective responses.\\nWhen conducting such evaluation panels often an ingredient may be \\ndistinguishable as different from the current supply when assessed in \\nisolation, but when that ingredient is present within the intended multi-\\ncomponent end products the difference in performance cannot be distin-\\nguished. A business that does not consider such aspects may be missing \\nout on potential supply benefits and cost savings. Therefore sometimes \\nthe most appropriate way to evaluate a proposed ingredient change is \\nvia review of the ingredient performance in the end product and not in \\nisolation.\\nEvaluation of the proposed ingredient performance within the end \\nproduct may also be appropriate when the characteristics of that ingredient \\nmake it very difficult to judge objectively when in isolation. For example \\nextra-mature blue Stilton cheese crusts may be purchased for their excellent \\nstrength of flavour when added to certain soups and sauces, but when eaten \\non their own some may find such ingredients overpowering. As a conse-\\nquence may select the mildest sample during preference testing, which \\nactually would not provide the same extent of flavour performance as the \\nstronger sample once added to the end product.\\nSome ingredients within a business manufacturing multicomponent food \\nproducts may be widely used across a large number of products. With regard \\nto sauce and soup manufacture such ingredients may include tomatoes, \\nmilks and creams which are often used as the background for soup and \\nsauce products, diced/sliced vegetables frequently used as a particulate or \\nblended component, and herbs/spices which are typically used to add extra \\nflavour.\\nKIL11.indd   217 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n218 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nClearly any change to an ingredient which is used within many different \\nproducts has the potential to cause widespread problems if the change is \\nnot controlled and ensured to be appropriate. For these reasons it is impor-\\ntant when considering such ingredient changes that \\u2018worst case\\u2019 scenarios \\nare considered, i.e. conducting kitchen or factory production trials upon the \\nproducts which contain the highest quantities or are most influence  by the \\ningredient that is being considered for change. Sometimes the result may \\nbe that a new ingredient is approved for use only in recipes where it is used \\nat a low level (e.g. below a threshold of noticeability/influence upon the \\nKSPs of the end product).\\nDuring all testing and evaluation of ingredients and their subsequent \\nperformance within the end products it is important to focus upon the \\naspects of the end product that the consumer would miss/notice when influ-\\nenced by a change in the characteristics of an ingredient. Will the end \\nconsumer notice the change? If so, will the consumer feel that the change \\nmakes the product better or worse, or will the consumer feel that the change \\nhas made no difference at all to their enjoyment of the product? It is impor-\\ntant to bear in mind whether or not proposed changes are going to be \\ncommunicated to the end consumer. If consumers are told that there is a \\ndifference then they will expect and seek to find a difference.\\n11.4.5 Packaging\\nThe delivery packaging of the ingredients can serve many functions includ-\\ning protection from physical damage, microbiological spoilage, contamina-\\ntion and flavour taints over shelf-life. Alongside these key factors it is worth \\nensuring that the ingredient delivery format facilitates a good range of \\ningredient assessment, including sensory evaluation, upon arrival. Factors \\nsuch as ensuring that all parts of a delivery can be accessed for inspection \\nalways need to be considered (e.g. vegetable delivery suppliers may use \\nDolavs or cages which can sometimes lead to certain individual ingredient \\npacks being inaccessible until the whole load is unpacked).\\nIn addition it may be costly to open packaging formats such as vacuum \\npacked meats for evaluation immediately upon delivery if the ingredient is \\nnot to be used until many days after delivery (as opening will allow air into \\nthe pack which will consequently reduce the shelf-life of the amount of \\ningredient remaining in the pack following testing). For such reasons the \\nmanufacturing operation may decide to defer a full assessment of the ingre-\\ndient quality until nearer the time of use (but not so near that there would \\nbe insufficient time to deal with any problems arising from this inspection), \\nor perhaps arrange for a smaller \\u2018sample pack\\u2019 to be sent alongside the main \\nlarger delivery packs. Such arrangements send a clear message to the sup-\\nplier that their customer is monitoring the quality of their supply upon \\ndelivery and therefore will heighten the supplier\\u2019s focus upon ensuring full \\nadherence to the specified quality standards.\\nKIL11.indd   218 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 219\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nWith regard to the final products produced, the packaging of the \\nend product (and in particular the direct food contact packaging) has \\nthe potential to impart flavour taints to the product if the packaging is \\nof a sub-standard quality (i.e. not suitable for food contact) or reacts \\nwith the product under certain conditions (e.g. some acidic products can be \\nquite chemically aggressive, leading to the increased potential for taints to \\noccur).\\nIf the product is to be cooked/re-heated within the food contact packag-\\ning then businesses should also be mindful of the potential for packaging \\nimpacts upon the end product during such heating phases (e.g. reactions \\noccurring upon microwave heating the end product where very high \\nlocalised temperatures can be reached, particularly when in the presence \\nof foods with a high oil content as the heat conductance of such oils can \\ncause particularly high temperature hot spots to occur and therefore \\nincrease the potential for chemical reaction/deterioration).\\nDuring the initial approval of packaging for product use it is vital that a \\nfull organoleptic analysis is conducted upon the food product which has \\nbeen held within the packaging in a manner which reflects the worst case \\nscenarios and timescales of the production process, storage, distribution and \\nconsumer end use.\\nIf the nature of the product would make it difficult to ascertain whether \\na flavour taint was being caused by the packaging (e.g. perhaps the product \\nis a very spicy, aromatic dish which would mask any flavour taints if present) \\nthen consideration should be given to also running trials upon more sensi-\\ntive products within the packaging. Such test products would ideally have \\nquite bland flavours and therefore could include water, mild food oil or \\nmashed potato. The manufacturer should select the most appropriate type \\nof test product for the packaging and intended end use.\\nSuch packaging/product tests could be conducted by a food manufac-\\nturer on a routine basis in order to form part of a packaging quality moni-\\ntoring programme, and should certainly be conducted upon any proposed \\nchange of packaging specification or packaging supplier.\\n11.4.6 Storage\\nIt is vital to product quality consistency and safety that all product ingredi-\\nents are stored in a manner which reflects the supplier\\u2019s recommendations \\nand good manufacturing practice upon aspects such as temperature control, \\nrelative humidity and the avoidance of physical damage (e.g. stacking/com-\\npression of goods). Whilst some ingredients (including chilled cut vegeta-\\nbles) will typically be used within a few days of arrival on site, many longer \\nshelf-life ingredients may be stored for weeks or months before being \\nrequired for use. It is therefore advisable for a business to monitor these \\ningredients during their storage phase for factors including organoleptic \\nperformance, as such checks will provide advanced notice of any developing \\nKIL11.indd   219 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n220 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nquality deterioration issue and therefore ensure sufficient time to rectify \\nthe matter without disruption to the business production plan.\\nRoutine checks during storage can also include review of the condition \\nof the ingredient packaging, as damage and poor seals can allow air ingress \\nwhich may accelerate spoilage, drying or oxidative reactions. An ever-\\nincreasing amount of foods are now reliant upon vacuum packaging or \\nmodified atmosphere packaging (MAP) for the achievement of their shelf-\\nlives and therefore a small seal failure across a batch if unnoticed can soon \\nlead to a major failure in organoleptic performance and possibly food safety \\nissues.\\nEnsuring that all ingredients are held within appropriate storage condi-\\ntions is a key factor in assuring their consistent organoleptic performance \\nover the course of their shelf-life. Optimal storage conditions will benefit \\neach ingredient and typically a multicomponent ready meal, soup or sauce \\nmanufacturing business will have chilled product stores running at below \\n+4 \\u00b0C and frozen goods stores running at below -18 \\u00b0C. With regard to \\nchilled and frozen products, high air flow conditions can significantly dry \\nany exposed product (in frozen products this is known as \\u2018freezer burn\\u2019 and \\ncan be protected against through thorough containment within the primary \\npackaging). Higher than ideal storage temperatures can encourage micro-\\nbiological growth which, in addition to the associated food safety issues, can \\nalso cause flavour taints and deterioration in product texture.\\nFurther assurance of organoleptic performance can be gained by instal-\\nlation of recording and alarm systems upon chills and freezers to confirm \\nthat the optimum running conditions are being consistently achieved. Rela-\\ntive humidity could also be monitored and controlled in dry goods stores, \\nas too much moisture within the air can lead to clumping of powders and \\nthe potential for elevated levels of microbial spoilage.\\n11.4.7 Ingredient shelf-life extension\\nOccasionally in food manufacturing operations there will be circumstances \\nwhere the business has a surplus of a particular ingredient which when \\nassessed against predicted usage rates would be at risk of exceeding its site \\nprocess use by/best before date before being scheduled for use. Such cir-\\ncumstances can occur due to over-ordering (perhaps resulting from a \\nmistake or due to planning to predicted orders which have turned out to \\nbe unrealistically high) or perhaps due to delays in the production plan \\ncaused by line breakdowns.\\nIf it is not possible to pull forward the next production date, in an attempt \\nto save the cost of ingredient stock losses food production businesses will \\nsometimes seek to extend the shelf-life of the ingredients at risk of going \\nout of date through factors such as formal review and agreement of shelf-\\nlife extensions with the particular ingredient supplier, or sometimes will \\nconsider the freezing of the particular \\u2018at risk\\u2019 ingredient stocks which \\nKIL11.indd   220 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 221\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nwould otherwise have perished before the date of the next scheduled use \\nif continued to be stored in chilled conditions. In such circumstances the \\nuse of sensory evaluation plays an important role in confirming that the \\ndecision to extend the shelf-life of the ingredient does not adversely affect \\nto an unacceptable extent the ingredient organoleptic properties, and as a \\nconsequence does not pose a threat to the quality of the end product.\\nIt should be noted that when considering the potential for ingredient \\nshelf-life extensions that the primary concern must always be that of product \\nsafety. (For example, during the additional shelf-life required is there a risk \\nof the safety of the ingredient being compromised?) If through a combina-\\ntion of detailed product/process knowledge and liaison with the ingredient \\nsupplier it can be ascertained that the application of additional shelf-life \\nwould not pose a threat to food safety, then it would be appropriate to \\nconduct a thorough sensory assessment in order to also confirm that the \\nextended shelf life ingredient will still deliver (and not threaten to damage) \\nthe required KSPs within the final product.\\nShelf-life extension checks should be conducted by experienced members \\nof the technical, quality and development teams, who have first-hand expe-\\nrience of the usual organoleptic properties of the specific ingredient, and \\nare well aware of the likely signs of deterioration or spoilage. Such signs \\ncan include off-aromas and off-flavours, colour deterioration and texture \\nchanges (e.g. perhaps a change to become slimy or dry).\\nPoints for consideration during such organoleptic assessments to under-\\npin shelf-life extensions include ensuring that a representative sample size \\nis being assessed from the ingredient stock in question, as the early signs of \\ningredient deterioration may be localised and not yet widespread across an \\ningredient batch. Businesses should also consider the balance of \\u2018risk to \\nreward\\u2019. If by applying an ingredient shelf-life extension the business is \\nsaving only a small amount of ingredient or money and has plenty of \\u2018within \\nstandard shelf life\\u2019 material in stock, is it worth the time, trouble and end \\nproduct quality performance risk to extend the shelf-life of the ingredient \\nstock?\\nIt should also be noted that the end customer, be it a supermarket or \\nfood service business, may have a supplier policy upon whether they autho-\\nrise (or need to be advised of) the procedure of controlled extensions to \\ningredient shelf-lives. Therefore with regard to ingredient shelf-life exten-\\nsions it is always wise for the manufacturer to check their customer policies \\nbefore considering how to proceed with the best interests of all parties in \\nmind.\\n11.4.8 Recipe preparation phase\\nThis processing stage typically involves the removal of the ingredients \\nfrom their primary packaging and measurement into their required recipe \\nweights to await further processing. This is therefore usually the first point \\nKIL11.indd   221 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n222 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nin the production process at which 100% of each ingredient can be handled \\nand closely reviewed. Such circumstances therefore provide a key control \\npoint for ensuring that each ingredient meets the organoleptic quality \\nrequired.\\nSome intake checks may have been deferred until the preparation phase \\nto avoid the potential for ingredient deterioration caused by opening the \\npackaging at an earlier stage, or perhaps a supplier ingredient delivery \\ncomprising of numerous separate batches which for further assurance of \\nproduct quality all require an individual check at this stage. Quality checks \\nat this stage could be classed as \\u2018vigilance\\u2019 by the factory preparation staff \\nwho should be trained to ensure that each ingredient being prepared con-\\nsistently appears to meet the quality standards required.\\nPreparation staff should be made aware that each ingredient may have \\nbeen stored on site for a significant amount of time and therefore could \\nhave deteriorated since delivery. Staff should also understand that whilst \\ningredients may have passed an inspection upon intake, the checker at that \\nstage is only likely to have viewed a small percentage sample of that ingre-\\ndient, whereas at the preparation stage all of the batch of that ingredient \\ncan be inspected to at least some extent. It is important therefore that staff \\nsee themselves far more as a key operators who are providing a vital QA \\nrole in monitoring product quality and questioning any issues, rather than \\nas team members who have a relatively narrow remit of only weighing \\ningredients.\\nIn a manufacturing business where many product recipes are being pro-\\ncessed on a daily basis it is unlikely that production staff will be able to \\nremember the key attributes of each specific ingredient, and it is also \\nunlikely that production staff would have the time to cross-reference every \\ningredient being processed against a written specification/description. \\nHowever, the relevant production staff could be trained upon an appropri-\\nate \\u2018top five organoleptic quality points\\u2019 or \\u2018key quality criteria\\u2019 for each \\ningredient group (e.g. meats, dairy, vegetables, herbs, spices) to enable them \\nto be particularly vigilant during the handling of every ingredient. Such \\nquality check points could include: Does the ingredient match its name \\ngiven upon the recipe sheet? (For example, Does the ingredient look like \\n10 mm Diced Streaky Smoked Rindless Bacon?) Are the appearance, \\ncolour and aroma as expected?\\nMost companies prefer their operators not to taste test the ingredients \\nduring the processing operation as such practices can be linked to poor \\nhygienic practice and can set a poor example to other staff. However, in \\nsome circumstances a taste check will provide a vital point of quality assur-\\nance and therefore each business should decide upon the appropriate \\namount of taste testing for their particular operation and the location at \\nwhich the taste testing should take place. Potentially such testing could take \\nplace within a designated area of the factory, perhaps a tasting table/booth \\ncould be set up in order to further highlight to staff that the tasting of \\nKIL11.indd   222 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 223\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\ningredients forms a key part of QA and should only be conducted in the \\ndesignated area and at the appropriate stages of the process.\\n11.4.9 Work in progress (WIP) storage\\nManufacturing operations need to ensure that the selected prepare  ingre-\\ndient storage methods do not have an adverse impact upon the organoleptic \\nperformance of the ingredient. Often manufacturers of multicomponent \\nfoods will ensure that the ingredient (or ingredient mix) is stored in lidded \\nfood grade plastic containers. The term \\u2018food grade\\u2019 expects that the sup-\\nplier of the container has selected/tested the material to ensure that it does \\nnot impart any flavours, taints or chemical compounds detrimental to the \\nsafety or quality of the ingredients to be contained.\\nClear labelling is important at this stage as the primary packaging is often \\nno longer present and the ingredient will therefore usually have a reduced \\n\\u2018prepared shelf-life\\u2019 which should be recorded upon the containers together \\nwith identification of the ingredient and the destination product/batch. \\nUsually the prepared shelf-life of each ingredient is kept as short as possible \\nto help ensure the ingredient\\u2019s quality at point of use.\\nWhilst the quality monitoring of work in progress (WIP) is often con-\\nfined to routine checks upon the prepared ingredient storage areas to \\nensure that the required holding conditions are being maintained and that \\nnone of the ingredients has exceeded is \\u2018prepared shelf-life\\u2019, sensory assess-\\nment will be required typically in the event of an ingredient quality query, \\nor in the circumstances where the standard \\u2018prepared shelf-life\\u2019 has been \\nexceeded (perhaps due to production delays or breakdowns) and the \\nfactory therefore requires a decision upon whether the prepared ingredient \\nis still acceptable for use. Where shelf-life extension is to be considered the \\nprimary consideration must always be that of product safety. The points \\ndocumented within Section 11.4.7 are equally as relevant in these circum-\\nstances at the WIP production stage.\\n11.4.10 Processing: mixing and cooking operations\\nAs with the preparation stage, the mixing/cooking stage is also a phase in \\nthe operation at which staff will have the opportunity to review and inspect \\nall of the ingredients to be used within the production batch. This processing \\nstage therefore provides another key QA point via monitoring that each \\ningredient meets the organoleptic standards required.\\nStaff who are trained in the sensory review of ingredients at this stage \\nwill be of great advantage to the food manufacturing operation. Ensuring \\nthat each ingredient to be added to the batch is of the quality standards \\nrequired is a key element of a food manufacturer\\u2019s QA system.\\nDuring their training the processing staff should be briefed upon the \\nneed for ingredient quality awareness at all times, and the importance of \\nKIL11.indd   223 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n224 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nnot assuming that the ingredient quality is bound to be correct just on the \\nbasis that the ingredient has passed other check points to reach this particu-\\nlar stage of the process. Often it is beneficial to highlight to processing staff \\nthat if they do not spot an ingredient problem prior to use, that ingredient \\nissue could then lead to an end product quality fault which may not be \\ntraceable back to that particular raw material fault, and consequently may \\nleave the process operator open to suspicion that they may have incorrectly \\nprocessed the product. Such an approach can help ensure that operators \\nremain vigilant and always question any ingredient quality issues that they \\nare not entirely sure upon.\\nAt the cooking/mixing stage there are a lot of ingredient physical and \\nchemical interactions occurring (e.g. Maillard reactions, blending or soften-\\ning of particulates, formation of oil-in-water emulsions). In an ideal world \\napplying the same cooking/mixing process (times, temperatures, mixing/\\nblending speeds, etc.) would result in exactly the same end product on every \\noccasion. However, as most food production operations are dealing with \\nnatural ingredients which can vary in variety, source and season, and also \\nvary in factors such as their temperature and age upon addition to the \\nproduct mix, such variations in the ingredients will often lead to variations \\nin the processing performance of the end product.\\nIt is also not uncommon for manufacturing sites to possess a variety of \\nprocessing equipment which can be used to produce the end products (e.g. \\ndicers, slicers, mixers, blenders, homogenisers, cookers, packing machinery, \\nchillers), and yet depending upon which equipment is available/selected, \\nthere can be variability in terms of the end results achieved (for example, \\nmixers, agitators and pumps will vary in their degree of damage caused to \\nthe food product).\\nAs a result of the variables detailed above, in order to ensure that the \\nend product meets the required sensory standards (e.g. appearance, aroma, \\ntaste, texture, viscosity), ideally the product sensory description will have \\nbeen written and agreed in a form which allows for an acceptable range of \\nproduct variability from one batch to the next. For example with regard to \\nsoups and sauces the colour reference may allow a shade either side of the \\nideal colour, and the product viscosity may allow for a set amount of devia-\\ntion from the standard target. As variation is a fact of life for most process-\\ning operations handling natural ingredients, the processing team often have \\nto assess the product at key stages within the production flow, and make \\nadjustments to the processing parameters in order to ensure that the desired \\nend result is achieved.\\nSuch checks and corrective actions typically involve sensory assessment \\nof the product/batch at the point of phase completion, and before progres-\\nsion to the next stage of the operation (typically a cooling or packing stage). \\nA sufficiently sized sample should be drawn from the most appropriate \\npoints in the batch (if the production batch is known to vary at certain \\npoints then all such points should be assessed) and the product should then \\nKIL11.indd   224 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 225\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nbe evaluated by the production operator or nominated quality assurance \\noperative against the appropriate product sensory description (see Fig. 11.1 \\nfor an example sensory description for chicken tikka masala). The selected \\nassessor should have been trained and screened in advance to confirm that \\nthey are capable of end product sensory analysis. Such staff training would \\ntypically take the form of the measures outlined earlier in this chapter.\\nUpon sensory assessment, if the product meets all of the defined require-\\nments then it can be allowed to progress to the next process stage. However, \\nif a non-conformance is raised at this stage then corrective action will typi-\\ncally be required. Corrective actions in soups and sauces may include:\\n\\u2022 addition of water if the batch is too thick;\\n\\u2022 extra cooking if the batch particulates are too firm;\\n\\u2022 extra homogenisation if the batch texture is too coarse;\\n\\u2022 addition of more thickening agent (e.g. starch) if the batch requires \\ngreater viscosity;\\n\\u2022 addition of extra particulates if the product texture has broken down.\\nMany such corrective actions have an impact upon the product recipe and \\nconsequently the ingredient declaration. It is therefore prudent to have \\nagreed the appropriate and acceptable corrective actions with the relevant \\nauthorities and customers in advance. Any product adjustments should also \\nbe logged upon the process records to ensure full traceability.\\nA similar approach can also be taken when assessing the results of \\nintermediate stage processes (e.g. pre-frying minced beef before addition \\nto a bolognaise sauce, or perhaps pre-blending a starch/powder slurry \\nmix before addition to a batch of soup). As previously mentioned, such \\nassessments will require specific sensory standards to be written. At their \\nsimplest these standards could be one-line reminders placed upon the \\nprocess sheets (for example \\u2018Check that the slurry mix is lump free before \\naddition to the batch\\u2019), or could be a more complex full sensory descrip-\\ntion (e.g. appearance, aroma, taste, and texture guidance for a batch of \\npar-cooked pilau rice which will then complete its cook at a later process-\\ning stage).\\nAs such product assessments and adjustments can be quite time consum-\\ning, and are typically conducted by production staff whose Key Perfor-\\nmance Indicators often include \\u2018speed of operation\\u2019/\\u2018throughput rates\\u2019, it is \\ntherefore important that these production operatives are encouraged not \\nto rush their work related to QA. Production staff are often time pressured \\nto complete the current product and move on to the next product in the \\nplan. However, it must be stressed to the operators that the primary con-\\ncerns of their role are the safety and quality of the food products and that \\ntherefore it is far more cost effective to take a little extra time to get the \\nproduct \\u2018right first time\\u2019.\\nAny batch recipe or process corrections/adjustments should be formally \\nfed back to the team member responsible for setting the production process/\\nKIL11.indd   225 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n226 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nproduction sheets (typically a \\u2018process technologist\\u2019) as the requirement to \\nroutinely have to adjust a particular product may suggest that the standard \\nproduction process requires a permanent adjustment or re-trialling in order \\nto increase the chances of first time success, and avoid the requirement for \\ntime-consuming corrective action every time that particular product is \\nmade. It is very important that where an operator has highlighted that there \\nhas been an issue which required \\u2018in-process correction\\u2019, the person respon-\\nsible for adjusting future productions to avoid a recurrence of the issue \\nshould always feed-back to the operator what corrective measures have \\nbeen taken. The production operator will then feel that their feedback has \\nbeen valued and will be focused upon highlighting other opportunities for \\nimprovement in the future. In circumstances where operators feel that their \\nfeedback is not listened to or that \\u2018we always have problems on this product\\u2019 \\nthere is a danger of acceptance of less than ideal quality standards and a \\nloss of quality focus over time.\\nWith regard to the physical provision of sensory descriptions to the \\nfactory operators for reference against when conducting their product \\nsensory checks, processing operations take different approaches, each of \\nwhich can be effective providing that they are managed and monitored \\ncarefully with close focus upon document control and issue of updates as \\nand when required. Common approaches include:\\n\\u2022 printing a summary of the product sen ory description upon the relevant \\nproduction process instruction sheets (e.g. the mixing/cooking sheet);\\n\\u2022 holding copies of all product sensory descriptions in files within the \\nrelevant processing areas;\\n\\u2022 maintaining an electronic database of sensory descriptions which can be \\naccessed at a computer terminal or printed out when required.\\nAll batch assessment checks should be recorded to maintain full trace-\\nability within the operation and help prove in the event of an issue/ \\ncomplaint that the batch was correct at that particular point in the opera-\\ntion. In addition the recording of such results and any further corrective \\nactions can also be used to trend analyse the product over time for any \\nroutine problems or seasonal variances. (For example, perhaps variation \\nwith regard to colour, flavour or texture which could be linked to seasonally \\nvarying produce. If the extent of such seasonal variability is unacceptable \\nthen a solution may be to opt to use a frozen version of the variable ingre-\\ndients, which has been harvested and frozen at one set point in the year, \\nand is then available to be used consistently all year round.)\\nIn batch production processes, where a number of separate batches of \\nthe same product are to be produced sequentially, a technique that is often \\nalso used during sensory assessment is that of maintaining a reference \\nsample of each of the previous batches for review against as each new batch \\nis made. Such comparison enables a check to ensure that the product per-\\nformance is not gradually drifting away from the required standard.\\nKIL11.indd   226 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 227\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\n11.4.11  Delays/holding times upon completion of the batch (or at key \\nstages of the batch/product process)\\nIn many production processes, following operations such as cooking/mixing, \\nand prior to packing there is the potential for a delay/holding time between \\nsuch process stages. Sometimes this amount of time needs to be closely \\ncontrolled to help ensure that the final end product quality will not be \\nadversely affected. For example in ready meal manufacture, rice which has \\nbeen cooked and chilled will ideally be used immediately but may be stored \\nin a refrigerated area for approximately 24 hours before packing as a com-\\nponent into the final ready meal packs (e.g. \\u2018Sweet and sour chicken with \\negg fried rice\\u2019). In such a scenario there is the potential during this holding \\ntime for the rice to become dry/hard, especially if it has been stored uncov-\\nered and placed in a chill store area which has a high air flow.\\nIt is therefore important not only to set an optimised storage method \\nand maximum amount of time before the component can no longer be used \\n(in ready meal production such limiting of holding times can be as much \\nrelated to product microbiological control as to product organoleptic \\ncontrol), but also to ensure that there is a confirmatory organoleptic assess-\\nment upon the component appearance, aroma, taste and texture before \\nfurther processing/packing. At this stage if the component quality is found \\nto have deteriorated beyond an acceptable point, the business would incur \\nfurther significant product, time and packaging cost losses by continuing to \\nprocess the product, only to realise later at final product analysis stage that \\na specific component has caused the entire product to be organoleptically \\nunacceptable. Well-timed sensory checks serve to ensure product quality \\nand help avoid incurring unnecessary costs by highlighting faults as early \\nas possible.\\n11.4.12 Product packing\\nThe process of packing the product following the recipe mix/cooking opera-\\ntion can have significant impacts upon the product\\u2019s organoleptic perfor-\\nmance. For example, when manufacturing soups and sauces the products \\nwill typically have been transferred from the recipe mix/cooking operation \\nvia a series of vessels, pipework and pumps (which may or may not have \\nbeen designed to handle the product as gently as possible) and will often \\nthen be held in an agitated vessel during the packing process in order to \\nensure a consistent mix/blend. In addition, if the products are being hot-\\nfilled into the packaging then the products will be hot and therefore con-\\ntinuing to cook whilst awaiting being packed into the final product \\npackaging.\\nHeat and agitation factors will lead to organoleptic effects such as the \\nsoftening of particulates, deterioration of starches/gels, colour and viscosity \\nchanges and therefore often the process technologist who has scaled-up the \\nproduct will have set a maximum batch size related to the rate at which the \\nKIL11.indd   227 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n228 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nproduct can be packed. (This packing rate is usually dictated by the speed \\nof the packing machines, and sometimes by the cooling/freezing capacity of \\nthe operation post-packing.) The technologist may calculate and set such \\nmaximum holding times by organoleptically assessing trial batches during \\nthe course of the batch packing operation until the point is reached where \\nthe product has deteriorated past a point of acceptability.\\nAny delays in the packing operation (perhaps due to machinery break-\\ndown) may incur further deterioration of the food. In order to reduce the \\nadverse impacts of such delays upon the end product in soup and sauce \\noperations, factories will often choose to turn off the agitation of the batch \\nduring the delay to reduce the physical impacts upon the product, and \\nwhere batches are held hot, a factory may also choose to reduce the holding \\ntemperature during the time of the delay (whilst ensuring that the tempera-\\nture reduction does not fall below a point where microbiological growth \\nmay become an issue).\\nIn the event of delays, food businesses will benefit from use of a \\u2018delay \\nprocedure\\u2019 (a summary of all of the actions required to be taken in the \\nevent of a process delay) which not only seeks to minimise the organoleptic \\nimpacts upon the product, but also ensures that the product quality is moni-\\ntored closely during the delay (typically via the requirement for routine \\nproduct assessments conducted by key staff) in order that the factory is \\nquickly aware of when the delayed batch has gone past the point of being \\nacceptable to pack. Where particulate deterioration in soups and sauces is \\na key concern, samples of the product may be routinely sieved to enable \\ncloser visual examination of the particulates. Sometimes colour change may \\nbe the main concern, requiring routine comparison against colour charts \\nduring the course of the delay.\\nThe physical packing process through vessels, agitators, pumps, pistons \\nand pipework can also have product quality impacts, which will be further \\nmagnified if a significant proportion of the product is being recycled within \\nthe process, perhaps due to product being reworked back into the batch \\npre-packing/holding system (e.g. if the packing of the batch is encountering \\nmachine problems causing a high level of pack weight or seal integrity \\nrejects which are then being reworked to save wastage).\\nThe significant scope for product organoleptic variation at the packing \\nphase usually leads to businesses placing a great deal of organoleptic scru-\\ntiny upon samples drawn from the final product at the start, middle and end \\nof the batch. Sometimes such checks are conducted even more frequently/\\nthroughout the packing operation if particular problems are being encoun-\\ntered; for example, excessive variability in particulate distribution which \\ntherefore requires further analysis to monitor and ascertain the root cause \\nof the issue.\\nIn soup/sauce batch production, focus upon a \\u2018distribution issue\\u2019 may \\nnecessitate routine \\u2018washouts\\u2019 of packs to ascertain the consistency of dis-\\ntribution of particulates across the packed batch (i.e. whether all of the \\nKIL11.indd   228 3/12/2010   7:55:51 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 229\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nproduct components are evenly present throughout the batch). Some par-\\nticulates may sink or float when the batch is being packed which can lead \\nto their being present mostly at the start or end of the batch. Also if certain \\nlarger size particulates are becoming blocked in the feed pipes/dosing \\npistons this may lead to their sporadic distribution as every so often the \\npressure may build up until a burst of those stuck particulates are finally \\ndosed into the packaging.\\n11.4.13  Pre- or post-packing \\u2018cooling/chilling\\u2019 phases and the sensory \\nevaluation of the end product\\nOrganoleptic deterioration is also a consideration in the product cooling/\\nchilling phases. For example, if the product is cooled in an open state, the \\nchilled air flow that it is exposed to may cause some drying of the product, \\nwhereas if a product is cooled in its packaging, although this may protect \\nthe product from the drying effect of chilled air flows, the product can \\nsometimes be found to take longer to cool due to the insulating effect of \\nthe packaging, which can also cause organoleptic changes. In addition, some \\ncooling/chilling operations may require the product to be agitated, or may \\nrequire the outer edges of the product to be crust frozen. Such aspects of \\ncooling processes will also impact upon the organoleptic performance of \\nthe end product.\\nOnly after the product has been packed and cooled can a business start \\nto be confident that its organoleptic quality tests are assessing the product \\nin a form that the end consumer is likely to experience. Therefore the final \\nproduct sensory evaluation of aspects including appearance, aroma, taste \\nand texture is a very important stage of the business QA system. At this \\nstage businesses will often evaluate a number of samples drawn from the \\nstart, middle and end areas of the production batch, the number of which \\nshould reflect the potential for variability within the production process. \\nFood manufacturers will typically ensure that these checks are conducted \\nimmediately upon the completed end product by an experienced member \\nof the cooling/packing teams or by a QA technician.\\n11.4.14  Taste panel\\nMost food manufacturers will also place all recently completed products \\nupon a routine (often daily) business taste panel which is attended by a \\nmultidisciplinary cross section of the business staff and management. It is \\nusually beneficial for the end product taste panel to include members of \\nthe NPD department, process development and sales teams, as these team \\nmembers will often be able to closely remember the customer\\u2019s expecta-\\ntions of the particular products and how these expectations should be \\nreflected within the KSPs of each particular product. Also having members \\nof the factory production and QA teams present at the formal end product \\nKIL11.indd   229 3/12/2010   7:55:52 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n230 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\ntaste panel will help ensure a good transfer of product sensory knowledge \\nand provide the opportunity to discuss any particular processing issues/\\nproblems being encountered.\\nMost end product taste panels will assess a representative sample of each \\nproduction batch against the sensory description (Fig. 11.1) set either inter-\\nnally or with the end customer. Some businesses choose to score the attend-\\nee\\u2019s assessment of each batch, while others choose a simple \\u2018pass/fail\\u2019 \\napproach. The more data that can be captured at this stage, the greater the \\npotential for trend analysis of results over time. Such results can be used to \\ndrive business focus upon product quality (e.g. trend analysis of end product \\ntaste panel results may show a gradual deterioration in a product\\u2019s colour \\nor texture over time which, owing to the gradual drift in standard, may not \\nhave been picked up by the individuals regularly attending each taste \\npanel).\\nThere is also a good case for insisting that during the taste panel product \\nassessment phase, every panellist should evaluate each sample in silence or \\nisolation from other panellists to ensure that their judgement cannot be \\ninfluenced in any way by more dominant, opinionated or senior members \\nof the panel. Potentially some panel members may be biased in their opin-\\nions upon the acceptability of products due to pressures such as production \\nthroughputs, financial impacts or customer demands.\\nAs the end product taste panel will typically be the most thorough \\norganoleptic evaluation that the product is going to receive on site, busi-\\nnesses should seek to ensure that the taste panels take place before the \\nparticular batches of products are due to be despatched to the customer. \\nThis will ensure that if a product is found at the business taste panel to be \\nunacceptable (or in need of further scrutiny), then the product will still be \\nwithin the control of the business, rather than incurring the difficult situa-\\ntion of having to consider a withdrawal/recall from the distribution chain \\nor customer.\\n11.4.15 Freezing\\nIf the end product is intended to be sold in a frozen format then there are \\noften extra organoleptic factors to be considered and monitored via the use \\nof sensory assessment during the product/process design phase and the \\nsubsequent production quality assurance phase. These considerations \\ninclude the fact that the freezing of food products will form ice crystals \\nwithin the food. Typically, the slower the freezing process, the larger the ice \\ncrystals formed and therefore the greater the potential to damage the food \\nproduct structure (including deterioration of the physical texture of particu-\\nlates and damage to product starch/gel suspensions, which can lead to \\nexcessive product syneresis upon defrost).\\nOther organoleptic quality issues that can arise at the product freezing \\nphase are the potential for \\u2018freezer burn\\u2019 (quality deterioration typically \\nKIL11.indd   230 3/12/2010   7:55:52 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 231\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\ncaused by product dehydration and oxidation, often linked to the product \\nnot being sufficiently wrapped in protective packaging) and also the poten-\\ntial for product quality loss during storage, which is especially a concern \\nfor products which are particularly susceptible to deterioration (for \\nexample, high-fat meat products can be particularly prone to rancidity \\nduring frozen storage). Poorly maintained freezer stores can also increase \\nthe potential for product deterioration due to significant fluctuations in air \\ntemperature.\\n11.4.16 Storage (Including monitoring over shelf-life)\\nBusiness efficiency pressures to produce larger product batch runs less \\nfrequently can lead to end products being held in storage for a significant \\namount of time pre-despatch to the customer. During this holding time \\nmost products organoleptic performance will typically be deteriorating. \\nThis is especially so if the product bears a \\u2018use-by\\u2019 code rather than a \\u2018best \\nbefore\\u2019 code (e.g. usually chilled products).\\nMost chilled foods will deteriorate during storage due to a combination \\nof microbiological, physical and chemical factors. Frozen foods may deterio-\\nrate due to ice crystal formation and aspects such as oxidative reactions and \\nfreezer burn. Ambient products could be susceptible to the absorbance of \\nmoisture from the environment over time (especially if not packaged in \\nrobust gas and moisture barrier packaging materials). External factors can \\nincrease the potential for such deterioration to occur, including higher than \\nideal chill store/frozen store temperatures.\\nAs a result of the potential for product deterioration during storage \\nsome businesses choose to conduct a sensory evaluation of the stored (stock \\nholding) batches on a routine basis and at a frequency which reflects the \\npotential for deterioration to occur. Such checks are important as it is better \\nto be aware of the deterioration of a product batch early in order that a \\nfresh batch run can be planned in time, rather than awaiting receipt of a \\ncustomer order, only to then find during final quality checks at point of \\ndespatch that the product does not meet the quality criteria required due \\nto deterioration which has occurred during storage.\\n11.4.17 Despatch\\nSome food companies tend to focus their taste panels on the final product \\njust before despatch to the customer. At this stage there is little that can be \\ndone to rectify any product problems which may have occurred earlier in \\nthe production process; however, such checks serve as a useful quality \\ncontrol check point and provide the major control of avoiding any sub-\\nstandard products from being despatched to the end customer.\\nFor these reasons the final assessment of product organoleptic perfor-\\nmance (compared against the requirements defined in the agreed customer \\nKIL11.indd   231 3/12/2010   7:55:52 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n232 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\nspecification) is typically seen as the final \\u2018quality safety-net\\u2019 prior to \\ndespatch.\\n11.5 Sensory quality assurance (QA) after product despatch\\n11.5.1 Distribution depot and in-store inspection\\nSensory checks upon the product are likely to continue even after it has \\nbeen despatched, usually in the form of \\u2018depot checks\\u2019 (typically conducted \\nupon delivery as part of the customer acceptance checks) or in-store/stock \\ninspections conducted by the customer. By having a clearly defined and \\nagreed sensory description/specification for each food product, quality \\nqueries and problems at depot and in-store can be reduced. Without agreed \\nproduct standards the manufacturer risks the potential for their foods to \\nbe judged and possibly rejected purely on subjective assessments.\\n11.5.2 End-of-life assessment/review\\nOn a routine basis many businesses review the organoleptic performance \\nof their products at the very end of the product shelf-life as part of their \\nQA program. These tests can involve comparison against newer stock of \\nthe products and focus upon comparison against the agreed/specified \\nsensory profile (which should define the target and limits of acceptability \\nupon aspects including product appearance, aroma, taste and texture). Typi-\\ncally such assessments will involve the use of a multidisciplinary panel \\nincluding members of the quality, NPD, process development, production \\nand sales teams.\\nTo best reflect the actual conditions that the product batches will encoun-\\nter during distribution and consumer storage, businesses should seek to \\nhold their end-of-life samples in temperature conditions which reflect the \\nend customer shelf-life testing criteria, and this is most easily achieved \\nthrough the use of storage incubators. However, many businesses choose to \\nsimplify this approach by purchasing samples of their products from the \\nrelevant retail/food service outlets, storing them in domestic fridges (set to \\ntemperatures recognised by industry research to reflect typical consumer \\nfridge conditions) for the remaining days of their shelf-life, followed by \\ntaste panel evaluation on the last day of the shelf-life to confirm that the \\norganoleptic shelf-life appears to be set correctly (i.e. the product quality \\nhas not yet deteriorated to a point of being unacceptable to the end \\nconsumer).\\nAs with the routine daily site taste panels the businesses may choose \\nto score the attendee\\u2019s assessment of each \\u2018end-of-life\\u2019 sample whereas \\nothers choose a simple \\u2018pass/fail\\u2019 approach. The results can then be trend \\nanalysed over time and reacted to in the event of a problem issue being \\nnoted.\\nKIL11.indd   232 3/12/2010   7:55:52 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\nSensory quality assurance 233\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\n11.5.3 Conflicts of interest\\nWhilst organoleptic performance is very important to the commercial \\nsuccess of the product, the vital issue of ensuring product safety can some-\\ntimes lead to compromises being necessary with regard to the achievement \\nof an optimum organoleptic quality. For example many food products \\nrequire cooking for a \\u2018longer than organoleptically ideal\\u2019 length of time to \\nachieve the required levels of microbiological reduction, thereby achieving \\nproduct safety and shelf-life, and in doing so the process may adversely \\naffect the texture, consistency or colour of the product.\\nAnother example is that product acidification to help achieve microbio-\\nlogical control and increased shelf-life can consequently impact upon the \\nflavour profile of the product and make product consistency (e.g. some \\nsoup/sauce starch suspensions) more prone to deterioration. As the cus-\\ntomer and business consequences of a food safety issue can be catastrophic, \\nit is vitally important that all departments work to the same site priorities, \\nalways ensuring product safety first whilst striving to attain the required \\nproduct quality/consistency.\\n11.6 Conclusions\\nAs can be seen by the numerous examples given in this chapter, the manu-\\nfacture of multicomponent food products such as soups, sauces and ready \\nmeals presents a wide range of potential for faults to occur with regard to \\nthe quality of the products being manufactured. It may be useful for the \\nreader to reflect upon the use of sensory evaluation as a tool in assuring \\nquality at each stage of the food production process. Such sensory evalua-\\ntion in support of quality assurance could be categorised in distinct phases \\nwhich include:\\n\\u2022 avoid: sensory techniques to help avoid product faults (e.g. checks to \\nconfirm the correctness of incoming ingredients);\\n\\u2022 detect: sensory techniques designed to detect product faults (e.g. checks \\nupon the organoleptic quality correctness of intermediary and end \\nproduct recipes);\\n\\u2022 decide: sensory techniques to help decision make and resolve issues (e.g. \\nsensory assessments and panels can be utilised to help decide whether \\na product quality fault contravenes the product specification and/or \\nrenders the product unacceptable to the end consumer. Sensory panels \\ncan also help a business decide whether the reprocessing/reworking of \\nexcess or sub-standard product batches is a possible salvage/cost saving \\noption, or whether such actions will merely result in creating further \\nnon-saleable stock).\\nThe key themes of benefit to businesses seeking to develop sensory \\ncontrol include:\\nKIL11.indd   233 3/12/2010   7:55:52 PM\\nB1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\nW\\noo\\ndh\\nea\\nd \\nPu\\nbl\\nis\\nhi\\nng\\n L\\nim\\nit\\ned\\nKilcast\\u2014Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n234 Sensory analysis for food and beverage quality control\\n\\u00a9 Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010\\n\\u2022 focus upon ensuring the correct and consistent quality of all ingredient \\nsupplies;\\n\\u2022 ensure that all manufacturing processes are well maintained, robust and \\nconsistent;\\n\\u2022 continually seek to make sensory checks objective rather than subjective \\nwherever possible;\\n\\u2022 always ensure that the sensory criteria required of the product are \\nrealistic and consistently achievable before being formally agreed/ \\ncommitted to with the end customer;\\n\\u2022 ensure that the product sensory criteria are clearly defined within the \\nagreed customer product specification, together with all acceptable tol-\\nerance limits;\\n\\u2022 constantly monitor (via supervisory checks and audits) that the required \\nsensory standard checks are diligently and consistently applied at each \\nkey stage of the manufacturing process.\\nThe application of sensory-related quality assurance techniques within the \\nready meal, soup and sauce sectors can be viewed as a vast and complex \\narea, yet the reader should be assured that the majority of the systems and \\nchecks applied are low cost, relatively straightforward in their design and \\napplication, and are best administered by trained staff who have sound \\nexperience of the products and good clear knowledge of the customer \\nexpectations.\\n11.7 Acknowledgements\\nBOSTWICK CONSISTOMETERS.

This report\\nis structured to guide investors through the key water risks facing these industries and features a\\nunique dataset ranking 37 major food companies on the quality of their corporate water management.\\nBecause the attributes of water are both industry- and location-specific, any risk analysis must take\\ninto account how much water a given company uses and pollutes, as well as the security of the\\nlocal water resources on which a company relies. Given the significant amount of water use and\\npollution associated with agricultural production, supply chain water risk can be as financially\\nmaterial as water risks facing a food company\\u2019s owned operations. Overall, corporate water risk\\nexposure can be thought of as a function of three variables (Exhibit 1):\\n1. Water dependence: The relative amount of water needed for a company\\u2019s direct operations\\nor supply chain, as well as the volumes and intensity of associated wastewater that must be\\nassimilated by a receiving body of water.\\n2. Water security: The degree to which conditions in specific operating or supply chain\\ngeographies\\u2014and related physical, regulatory and reputational risks\\u2014threaten the underlying\\nsecurity of a company\\u2019s access to water and ability to discharge wastewater. Water security can\\nbe undermined by a company\\u2019s own impacts, or by cumulative impacts from others within or\\nacross sectors. It can weaken a company\\u2019s ability to operate profitably, especially when\\ncombined with high corporate water dependence.\\n3. Strength of corporate management response: Companies have a host of options available to\\nmitigate water risks\\u2014ranging from operational water efficiency improvements to setting water\\nefficiency expectations for suppliers to undertaking watershed-level actions that help support\\noverall improvements in water resource sustainability.\\nExhibit 1: Key Elements of Corporate Water Risk: Water Dependence, Water Security & Response\\nCorporate Water Risk Dashboard\\nChapter Guide\\nChapter 1, \\u201cWater Risks Facing the Food Sector,\\u201d provides investors an overview of the relative\\nwater dependence of companies in the packaged food, beverage, meat and agricultural products\\nindustries. This chapter outlines the key risk drivers that threaten water security for the sector, and\\nrecommends a set of indicators that can be used to evaluate company risk exposure. \\nChapter 2, \\u201cA Primer on Analyzing Agricultural Water Risk,\\u201d lays out a framework for evaluating\\nwater risks specific to the agricultural supply chain. The framework takes into account crop-specific\\nand region-specific water impacts and risks, the nature of a company\\u2019s sourcing model, and relevant\\ntactics for mitigating agricultural water risks, from corporate procurement policies down to specific\\nfarming practices. \\nChapter 3, \\u201cBenchmark Results: Key Findings,\\u201d provides data on the corporate water risk\\nmanagement performance of 37 companies in the packaged food, beverage, meat and agricultural\\nproducts industries. The companies evaluated are largely public, U.S.-headquartered firms listed\\non the S&P 500 and Russell 1000 indices.\\nChapter 4, \\u201cBenchmark Results: Findings by Water Management Category,\\u201d provides a more \\nin-depth discussion of the benchmarking results within each water management category and\\nincludes examples of leading corporate practices.\\nChapter 5, \\u201cRecommendations for Companies and Investors,\\u201d provides investors and food sector\\ncompanies with recommendations for improving water risk analysis and management.\\nAppendix A details the company benchmarking methodology and Appendix B provides \\ncompany-specific scores for each indicator evaluated. Appendix B is also available online \\nas a downloadable spreadsheet at: www.ceres.org/foodwaterrisk.\\nAppendix C provides data on the relative water risks of the top agricultural commodities purchased\\nby companies in this report and Appendix D provides a list of third-party databases and resources\\nrelevant to water issues in the food sector.\\nFor further guidance on corporate water risk analysis, see Ceres\\u2019 Investor Handbook for Water\\nRisk Integration, available at www.ceres.org/investorwaterhandbook \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks How to Use This Report6\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Executive Summary 7\\nExecutive Summary\\nThe global food sector faces extraordinary risks from the twin challenges of water scarcity \\nand water pollution. Growing competition for water, combined with weak regulations, failing\\ninfrastructure, pollution and climate change impacts threaten the sector\\u2019s water security and\\ncontribute to a water availability emergency that was recently ranked the world\\u2019s \\u201ctop global risk\\u201d \\nby the World Economic Forum.1\\nThis report examines how water risks affect the profitability and competitive positioning of 37\\nmajor food sector companies in four industries: packaged food, beverage, meat and agricultural\\nproducts. It evaluates and ranks these companies\\u2014the majority of which are U.S. domiciled and\\npublicly-traded\\u2014on how well they are positioned to anticipate and mitigate these risks, as well as\\ncontribute to improved water resource management. \\nThe report provides recommendations for how analysts and investors can effectively evaluate \\nfood sector companies on their water risk exposure and management practices. It also provides\\nrecommendations for how food companies can improve water efficiency and water quality across\\ntheir operations and supply chains to reduce risks and protect water resources. \\nWater Risks Facing the Food Sector\\nFrom farm to factory, producing food is the most water-intensive business on earth. Abundant\\nclean water is essential to food processing\\u2014as an ingredient, for cleaning and moving raw materials,\\nand as the principal agent used in sanitizing plant machinery. However, the vast majority of the\\nfood sector\\u2019s water use and water pollution footprint is associated with the agricultural supply \\nchain. Seventy percent of the world\\u2019s freshwater is used to irrigate crops and raise animals. Currently,\\none-third of total food production is in areas of high or extremely high water stress, or competition.2\\nThe run-off of fertilizers from farm fields is one of the most common causes of water pollution worldwide,\\ncausing dead zones, harming fisheries, affecting human health and raising water treatment costs.\\nThis report identifies five important water risk drivers that affect the water security of the food\\nsector: 1) growing competition for water, 2) weak regulation, 3) aging and inadequate water\\ninfrastructure, 4) water pollution and 5) climate change. These water risks are already affecting\\ncorporate income statements and balance sheets due to: disrupted operations and limits on growth\\ndriven by water shortages and loss of social license to operate; increased operating costs due to\\nabrupt water rate hikes and stricter regulations; and reduced margins due to higher commodity\\ncosts linked to decreases in agricultural productivity (Exhibit ES.1). \\nMany food sector companies are acknowledging these risks: 82 percent of food sector respondents\\nto the CDP\\u2019s 2014 water information request indicate that water risks could have a substantive\\nimpact on business operations and 90 percent of the 31 publicly-traded U.S. companies evaluated \\nin this report cite water as a material risk in their 10-K financial filings. \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Executive Summary8\\nRecent examples of financial impacts include:\\n\\u25cf Cargill reported a 12 percent drop in 2014 fourth-quarter profits as a four-year drought \\nin the U.S. Southwest damaged pastures used to raise beef.3\\n\\u25cf The Campbell Soup Company saw a 28 percent drop in its California-based carrot division\\nprofits in early 2015 due in part to drought followed by intense rains.4\\n\\u25cf The Coca-Cola Company decided not to move forward on the development of an $81 million\\nbottling plant in southern India in April 2015 due to resistance from local farmers who cited\\nconcerns about strains on local groundwater supplies.5\\n\\u25cf GrainCorp, Australia\\u2019s largest agribusiness, reported a 64 percent drop in 2014 profits due \\nto a prolonged drought that cut grain deliveries by 23 percent and nearly halved grain exports.6\\n\\u25cf J.M.

Agricultural products and meat companies had\\nmedian scores of 13.5 and 10.5, respectively. \\nCorporate Governance & Management \\nAlthough water risk was identified as a corporate governance priority by many of the companies,\\nboard oversight of water did not consistently translate into strong absolute performance. Of the\\n16 companies with board oversight of water risk, most performed relatively poorly, with more than\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Executive Summary10\\n60 percent receiving fewer than 35 total points. In addition, for nearly half (19) of the companies\\nevaluated, management-level oversight for water was relegated to executives at least two levels\\nbelow the CEO. Most CEOs are not directly incentivized to address water risk: Campbell Soup,\\nDean Foods, Molson Coors and Unilever are the only companies that offer explicit financial\\nincentives to the CEO and executive officers for water-related performance. \\nOnly 30 percent (11) of companies indicated that water risks were considered as part of major\\nbusiness planning activities and investment decision-making. Although water is notoriously\\nunderpriced in most markets, Nestl\\u00e9 and Unilever are the only companies in this assessment that\\ndisclose using a \\u201ctrue cost\\u201d or shadow price for water to analyze the return on investment of water-\\nefficiency investments. \\ndirect Operations\\nA majority of companies (23) have begun to evaluate water risks in their direct operations, but\\ntwo-thirds (22) are still not evaluating water issues in their agricultural supply chains. Basic water\\naccounting data on direct operations performance is common, with 70 percent (26) of companies\\ndisclosing basic data on water use. In addition, 70 percent (26) have targets to reduce water use in\\ntheir direct operations, although the aggressiveness of these targets varies. \\nWater quality issues get less priority. Most companies assessed do not disclose the percentage \\nof their facilities that are in compliance with local wastewater discharge regulations. Only two\\ncompanies\\u2014Coca-Cola and Nestl\\u00e9\\u2014reported goals to reduce wastewater discharges and improve\\nwater quality beyond compliance requirements. \\nMost companies are limiting their investments in water risk mitigation to improving facility-level\\nwater use efficiencies. Because many water risks stem from the impacts of other water users \\nand poor regulations, such a narrow operational focus may overlook lower-cost, higher impact\\nopportunities to help address critical watershed-level challenges. Only four companies\\u2014Coca-Cola,\\nGeneral Mills, Molson Coors and PepsiCo\\u2014have developed collaborative watershed protection\\nplans that are linked to regions of high water risk. \\nManufacturing Supply Chains\\nNearly one-quarter of companies (9) ask their manufacturing suppliers to report on water use,\\nwastewater discharge and management practices. General Mills and Campbell Soup ask suppliers\\nto complete supplier scorecards that include water use sections. Only five companies require their\\nmanufacturing suppliers to establish their own water management programs. \\nAgricultural Supply Chains\\nOnly six companies have sustainable agriculture policies that address water, with PepsiCo\\u2019s\\nand Unilever\\u2019s being the most robust. Unilever has an Agricultural Code of Conduct that includes\\nan entire section focused on water use and pollution and defines practices with which agricultural\\nproducers are expected to comply. \\nDespite the lack of policies, 41 percent (15) of companies have set time-bound goals to source\\nagricultural commodities more sustainably. For many companies, these commitments were\\nlimited to just one or two commodities. Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kellogg, and Unilever have \\nall set time-bound goals to source the majority of their agricultural inputs from farmers using\\nsustainable water management practices.\\nForty-three percent (16) of companies gather data from agricultural producers on the water\\nimpacts of their farming practices. For most companies, the data collected is often from a very\\nnarrow subset of their overall production base, and in many cases it is unclear how this data \\nis being used to inform sourcing decisions or to help farmers improve their practices.\\nRecommendations for Companies & Investors\\nCompany Recommendations  \\n1. Increase board oversight and understanding of material water risks. Corporate board members\\nhave a fiduciary duty for risk management oversight. While 43 percent (19) of the companies\\nevaluated in this report have board committees charged with environmental oversight, this oversight\\ndid not consistently translate into strong water management performance. Board charters should\\nbe strengthened to explicitly mention water. Additionally, board members should be regularly\\nbriefed by management on water-related risks, and provided with opportunities to engage with\\nexternal water experts.\\n2. Conduct robust water risk analysis. Many of the companies assessed in this report have relatively\\nweak systems\\u2014if any at all\\u2014for collecting and interpreting data on the severity of their exposure\\nto water risks. Companies should accelerate risk assessments, including analysis of their\\nmanufacturing and agricultural supply chains. When conducting water risk analysis, companies\\nshould bear in mind the various kinds of water risks to which they may be exposed (e.g. physical\\nscarcity risks and quality risks, regulatory risks, social license to operate risks), use forward-\\nlooking models or scenarios to identify the likelihood and severity of future risks, and use robust\\ndatasets to support this analysis (see Appendix D).\\n3. Address watershed-level risks. Most food sector companies are limiting their investments \\nin water risk mitigation to improving facility- or field-level water use efficiencies and meeting\\nregulatory compliance standards. While these efforts are critically important, even achieving\\nbest-in-class water use efficiency may not be sufficient to mitigate the physical, regulatory \\nor reputational risks resulting from the broader mismanagement of local water resources. \\nA narrow operational focus may also overlook lower-cost, higher-return opportunities to work\\ncollaboratively to reduce risks through activities that protect and restore watersheds. Companies\\nshould develop water risk mitigation plans that incorporate targeted investments to improve the\\nconditions of the most at-risk watersheds on which their facilities and supply chains depend.\\nCompanies should also consider opportunities to align public policy positions and lobbying\\nactivities in ways that encourage government officials to implement more sustainable water\\nmanagement policies.\\n4. Tackle water risks and impacts in agricultural supply chains. As water supplies are increasingly\\ndepleted and polluted in major agricultural regions across the world, traditional risk management\\napproaches such as hedging and geographic diversification are becoming less effective.\\nCompanies can achieve more by engaging directly with their supply chain to strengthen farmer\\npractices and protect watersheds. Key strategies include setting sustainable agriculture policies\\nand time-bound sourcing goals, purchasing certified sustainable commodities where relevant,\\nand collecting data from farmers on their practices while providing assistance and incentives \\nfor improvement.\\n5. Improve disclosure. Companies need to disclose to investors their exposure to water risk, as well as\\nstrategies and progress made in mitigating such risks. As much as possible, data should be reported\\nat the facility or regional level. Companies publicly-listed in the United States are required by the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to disclose to shareholders financially material risks\\nrelated to climate change and water in their operations and supply chains.10 Additionally, investors\\nexpect companies to provide more detailed disclosure of risks and mitigation strategies through\\ntheir corporate sustainability reports and in responses to CDP\\u2019s annual water information request.  \\nInvestor Recommendations\\n1. Analyze corporate water risk in terms of water dependence, security and response. When\\nevaluating a company\\u2019s overall risk, use the information and data resources suggested in this\\nreport to capture corporate water dependence (the amount of water needed for a company\\u2019s\\ndirect operations and supply chain, as well as the volumes and intensity of associated wastewater\\nthat must be assimilated by a receiving water body); the security of the water resources they \\nrely on; and the quality of management response to those risks.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Executive Summary 11\\n2. Go beyond direct operations to consider supply chain water risks. While most companies \\nin the food sector are not directly involved in agricultural production, many are significantly\\nexposed to agricultural water risks through their suppliers. When analyzing water risks\\nembedded in agricultural supply chains, consider that risk exposure is shaped by several\\nfactors, including the primary agricultural commodities the company buys, the level of water\\ndependence and security associated with those commodities, as well as the sourcing model\\nused by the company to procure agricultural inputs.  \\n3. Engage underperforming companies. Investors should engage portfolio companies on how they\\nmanage water risks. As a result of poor disclosure by many companies in the sector, investors\\nneed to engage directly with corporate management to gather relevant information and encourage\\nfuture disclosure. In addition to direct engagement, consider leveraging existing collaborative\\ninvestor efforts that engage companies on water, such as Ceres\\u2019 Investor Network, the United\\nNations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment\\u2019s (UNPRI) \\u201cWater Risks in Agricultural\\nSupply Chains\\u201d group, and the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility\\u2019s (ICCR) Water &\\nFood group.11\\n4. Integrate information from water risk analysis and corporate engagement into buy/sell\\ndecisions and beyond. Taking into account unique investor objectives, possible approaches\\ninclude embedding water analysis into overall environmental, social and governance scores;\\naltering the size of the investment universe to either avoid high water risk industries or companies,\\nor include companies with a strong management response; and embedding water risk analysis\\nin scenario analysis in financial models. Investors can conduct portfolio-level analysis of exposure to\\nhigh water risk regions, companies or agricultural activities. It is also beneficial to analyze cross-\\nasset class exposure, from equities and fixed income to commodities and farmland funds. For\\nother approaches and more details, see Ceres\\u2019 Investor Handbook for Water Risk Integration.12\\n5. Support efforts to increase and standardize food sector reporting on water. While some food\\nsector companies had robust disclosure, most did not, with some companies failing to report\\nbasic information on their water use and only 43 percent providing data to CDP\\u2019s 2014 water\\ninformation request. Investors should encourage company reporting to CDP, and also support\\nimprovements to the survey to ensure that more comparable, industry-relevant data is requested\\nfrom food sector companies. Investors may also wish to engage the Sustainability Accounting\\nStandards Board (SASB) on food sector water metrics.13\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Executive Summary12\\nWater & the Food Sector\\nClean water is already in short supply. The amount of water on the planet is for all practical purposes\\nfixed. Only 2.5 percent of the world\\u2019s water is freshwater. With 68 percent of that total locked up in\\nglaciers, humans rely on the remaining 30 percent found in surface and groundwater.1 However,\\nmuch of this freshwater is polluted and water quality is deteriorating in many parts of the world.2\\nConstrained water supplies face growing demand. The trends of population growth, urban migration,\\nrising incomes and climate change are slated to lead to a 50 percent increase in water withdrawals\\nin developing countries and an 18 percent increase in developed countries by 2025.3 By that time,\\ntwo-thirds of the world\\u2019s population will be living in areas of high water competition or \\u201cwater stress,\\u201d5\\nand subject to periodic shortages of water.4 Meanwhile, at least 20 percent of the water used to\\nirrigate crops (equivalent to roughly eight percent of total global food production) is non-renewable,\\ncoming from groundwater basins that are being rapidly depleted.6\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 1 13\\nWater Risks Facing the Food Sector\\nChapter Overview\\n\\u25cf The global food sector faces extraordinary risks from the twin challenges of water scarcity \\nand water pollution.

From the field to the factory, producing food\\nis the most water-intensive business on earth. The majority of the food sector\\u2019s water use and water\\npollution footprint is associated with the agricultural supply chain. Irrigating crops and raising\\nanimals consumes roughly 70 percent of the world\\u2019s freshwater.7 For instance, beef uses more\\nwater than anything else humans eat. Raising a kilogram of beef requires 15,415 liters of water\\n(primarily to grow the feed for the animals). A kilo of pasta requires 1,850 liters of water, most \\nof it for growing the wheat.8 In addition, many agricultural practices contribute to water pollution. \\nIn China, a 2010 government study found that the manure and chemical fertilizer run-off from\\nfarms causes more pollution nationwide than industry.9, 10\\nAbundant clean water is also essential to food processing\\u2014as an ingredient, an initial and\\nintermediate cleaning source, an efficient conveyor of raw materials, and the principal agent used\\nin sanitizing plant machinery (Exhibit 1.1). Some food processing activities, particularly in the\\nmeat sector, are also associated with high levels of contaminated wastewater discharge that must\\nbe treated before being returned to the water supply. \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 1 15\\nExhibit 1.1: Water Dependence: Key Water Use & Pollution Issues in the Food Sector\\nAgricultural producers\\n(Farmers, ranchers, dairies, etc.)\\nAgricultural products\\nIndustry\\nBeverage \\nIndustry\\nMeat processors \\nIndustry\\npackaged Food \\nIndustry\\nUSES OF FRESH WATER\\n\\u2022 Crop irrigation\\n\\u2022 Drinking & cooling\\nwater for livestock\\n\\u2022 Cleaning & disinfecting\\n\\u2022 Air conditioning of\\nlivestock facilities\\n\\u2022 Product washing \\n& moving\\n\\u2022 Cooling water\\n\\u2022 Boiler water\\n\\u2022 Air conditioning\\n\\u2022 Freshwater as \\nan ingredient \\n\\u2022 Product washing \\n& moving\\n\\u2022 Cooling water\\n\\u2022 Boiler water\\n\\u2022 Cleaning & disinfecting\\n\\u2022 Air conditioning\\n\\u2022 Drinking & cooling \\nwater for livestock\\n\\u2022 Cleaning & disinfection\\n\\u2022 Boiler water\\n\\u2022 Cleaning processing\\nequipment\\n\\u2022 Air conditioning\\n\\u2022 Freshwater as \\nan ingredient \\n\\u2022 Product washing \\n& moving\\n\\u2022 Cooling water\\n\\u2022 Boiler water\\n\\u2022 Cleaning & disinfection\\n\\u2022 Air conditioning\\npOTEnTIAL SOURCES OF WASTEWATER / pOLLUTIOn\\n\\u2022 Run-off of water from\\nfarm fields that is\\npolluted with fertilizer,\\npesticides & herbicides\\n\\u2022 Animal manure\\nmanagement/lagoons\\n\\u2022 Pathogenic organisms\\nfrom livestock spread\\ndiseases \\n\\u2022 Run-off of water from\\nfarm fields that is\\npolluted with fertilizer,\\npesticides & herbicides\\n\\u2022 Wastewater from\\nprocessing is high \\nin suspended solids,\\norganic sugars,\\nstarches & residual\\npesticides\\n\\u2022 Fermentation processes\\nproduce wastewater\\nthat is high in\\nbiochemical oxygen\\ndemand\\n\\u2022 Animal manure, which\\ncan sometimes contain\\nantibiotics and arsenic\\n\\u2022 Blood by-products\\nwhich are high in\\nbiochemical oxygen\\ndemand (an indicator\\nof the level of organic\\nmatter in wastewater)\\n\\u2022 Wastewater discharge\\ncontaining high levels of\\nnitrogen & phosphorus\\n\\u2022 Pathogenic organisms\\nin wastewater \\n\\u2022 Chlorine residue from\\ndisinfecting pathogenic\\norganisms\\n\\u2022 Biochemical oxygen\\ndemand (an indicator\\nof the level of organic\\nmatter in wastewater),\\ntotal suspended solids,\\nresidual chlorine \\n& pesticides\\ndirect OperationsFood Sector Supply Chain\\nSource: United National Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Pollution from food processing factories and environmental protection,\\nhttp://www.unido.org/fileadmin/import/32129_25PollutionfromFoodProcessing.7.pdf\\nThe majority of the food sector\\u2019s water use and water pollution footprint is associated with the activities of the agricultural supply chain\\u2014namely\\nirrigation and agricultural run-off.

In areas of\\nMexico, water demand is far outstripping groundwater supplies, leading to significant price hikes\\nfor industrial users as well as new usage limits.22 In 2013, water price increases in Mexico were as\\nhigh as 300 percent and new regulations and fees for allotted water volumes at food manufacturing\\nplants, including those of Kellogg, led to higher operating costs.23 In Kenya, alcoholic beverage-maker\\nDiageo anticipates its operations will face growth restrictions in the next five years as a growing\\npopulation outpaces water supplies.24\\nRelevant Financial Indicators\\nIncreased operating costs due to higher water rates or costs of acquiring \\nalternative water sources\\nRevenues and projected revenues affected due to production interruptions \\nor constraints on growth\\nHigher cost of goods sold due to water constraints on agricultural production\\n\\uf0da Increased conflict with other water users & loss of social license to operate. Water shortages\\namplify reputational issues for companies who are seen as competing with local communities for\\naccess to water supplies. This can lead to the loss of a company\\u2019s social license to operate, business\\ndisruption and brand damage. The Coca-Cola Company decided not to move forward on the\\ndevelopment of an $81 million bottling plant in southern India in April 2015 due to resistance from\\nlocal farmers who cited concerns about strains on local groundwater supplies.25 Even in water-rich\\nregions, companies perceived as using water unfairly may be exposed to reputational risk or loss of\\ncommunity support.26\\nRelevant Financial Indicators\\nRevenues or projected revenues affected due to production interruptions \\nor constraints on growth\\n2. WEAK REGUlATION \\nMany local and national governments and ministries lack the policy frameworks, institutional\\ncapacity and political will to manage competing water demands, maintain acceptable water\\nquality and enforce permits. Most governments around the world have historically chosen \\nto charge less than the full cost for water service for a variety of reasons, typically leading \\nto inefficient water use by both urban and agricultural users, despite scarcity. In many regions,\\nwater permits are free, and sometimes\\u2014particularly in the case of groundwater use\\u2014completely\\nunregulated. In many markets, governments also tend to administer water sector activities\\nseparately, leaving urban, agricultural and industrial water use poorly measured and coordinated. \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 1 17\\nBusiness impacts: \\n\\uf0da Shortages, rationing or reallocation of water permits. Inappropriate water permit allocation \\nand a lack of effective pricing, water markets, or incentives to moderate demand increase the\\nlikelihood of shortages. In India, the world\\u2019s biggest user of groundwater in the world, the water\\ntable is falling precipitously in many areas because of a lack of regulation of well-drilling and the\\nadoption of motorized pumps, which run on subsidized energy and number 27 million, up from\\ntens of thousands in the 1960s.27, 28 Nestl\\u00e9 reports that in 2013 the company temporarily reduced\\nwater consumption or halted operations at facilities in both India and Ghana due to shortages. \\nRelevant financial indicators\\nRevenues and projected revenues affected due to production interruptions \\nor constraints on growth \\nHigher operating costs if alternative water sources must be found\\nHigher cost of goods sold due to water constraints on agricultural production\\n\\uf0da Abrupt rate hikes for water and wastewater treatment. Delays in introducing effective water\\npricing or water allocation management systems increase the likelihood of steep or abrupt water\\nand wastewater rates hikes for industry, especially when drought or shortages increase political\\npressure on regulators to take action. In many regions, there is a negative correlation between \\nthe cost of water and its relative scarcity (Exhibit 1.4). If introduced quickly, water rate hikes \\nhave the potential to significantly affect the market capitalization of companies. A recent analysis\\nshowed that an increase in industrial water rates across Brazil to a level equivalent to the highest\\nrates already charged in some regions of the country could decrease the market cap of the\\nBrazilian packaged food sector by more than five percent.29\\nThe rate of water price increases is accelerating in many parts of the world. Between 2011 and 2014,\\nwater and wastewater prices in the BRIC countries jumped 22 percent and 25.9 percent, respectively,\\nwhile U.S. water and wastewater prices grew by 17.6 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively.30 China \\nis expected in the next three years to increase water tariffs by 30 percent nationally.31\\nRelevant financial indicators\\nHigher operating costs due to increased water rates\\nIncreased capital expenditures in technologies that reduce water \\nand wastewater intensity of operations\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 118\\nExhibit 1.4: Global Water Prices Relative to Water Stress ($/m3)\\n\\u0003 Low price High price \\u0002\\n\\u0000\\nHigh Stress\\nLow Stress\\n\\u0001\\n\\u0006 Countries\\nSources: 2014 GWI Water Tariff Survey, Global Water Intelligence, http://www.globalwaterintel.com/tariff-survey/\\n& 2013 Aqueduct Data, World Resources Institute, http://www.wri.org/resources/data-sets/aqueduct-country-and-river-basin-rankings\\nIn many countries facing high water stress, water prices are subsidized and fail to reflect the scarcity value of water.\\n\\u00d8\\n$2\\n\\u00d8\\n$4\\n\\u00d8\\n$6\\n\\u00d8\\n$8\\n\\u00d8\\n$10\\n5 -\\n4 -\\n3 -\\n2 -\\n1 -\\n0 - \\u00d8\\n$0\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 1 19\\n3. AGING OR INADEqUATE INFRASTRUCTURE & ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER \\nDeveloped and developing countries share a common problem of water infrastructure systems\\nbeing substantially under-funded. In developed countries, massive investment is needed to\\nrepair deteriorating, aging systems. A 2012 study by the American Water Works Association (AWWA)\\nestimates that the U.S. needs to spend $1 trillion over the next 25 years on the most urgent\\ninvestments.32 The developing world, even within BRIC countries, is marked by a lack of\\nconsistent access to potable water and sanitation for millions of households. \\nBusiness Impacts:\\n\\uf0da Risk of water supply and treatment failures. Lack of reinvestment in aging infrastructure \\nby water and wastewater utilities increases the risk of failures (water mains breaking, treatment\\nfailures) that could impact business or bring production to a halt. As a result, companies may have\\nto invest more in their own supplies and treatment to ensure supply reliability and quality. In the\\nU.S., where most systems are over 50 years old, 240,000 water mains break annually.33 Mexico\\ncurrently treats only 48 percent of its municipal wastewater.34 Faced with declining water quality\\nfrom municipal sources, Nestl\\u00e9 installed sophisticated technology in its Lagos de Moreno, Mexico\\nice cream plant that extracts excess water from incoming milk, and then recycles it, dramatically\\ncutting water use.35, 36\\nRelevant financial indicators\\nRevenues and projected revenues affected due to production interruptions \\nor inability to expand existing operations\\nIncreased capital expenditures in water storage, wastewater treatment \\nand recycling technologies\\n\\uf0da Harm to corporate-community relations. Inadequate delivery of water and sanitation by\\ngovernment to local communities enhances perceptions of inequity of access and harms corporate-\\ncommunity relationships, potentially restricting a company\\u2019s ability to operate or grow. This is\\nbecoming a bigger issue as access to water becomes more widely recognized as a human right.37\\nRelevant financial indicators\\nRevenues and projected revenues affected due to production interruptions \\nor constraints on growth\\n\\uf0da loss of ecosystems services. A lack of integrated water management and sound public land\\nuse planning (destruction of watersheds or forested areas) can lead to losses of natural systems \\nfor cleaning water and storing water, and managing variability in precipitation and water flows,\\nincreasing costs of water delivery, and wastewater treatment, as well as increasing risk of shortages.\\nSome companies have recognized the value of protecting and restoring green infrastructure. \\nFor example, after its water prices rose in Colombia due to more intensive water treatment costs,\\nbrewer SABMiller helped fund a project in Bogota to protect a watershed used by eight million\\npeople and the company\\u2019s breweries.38\\nRelevant Financial Indicators\\nRevenues and projected revenues affected due to production interruptions \\nor inability to expand existing operations\\nHigher operating costs due to increased water or wastewater treatment rates\\n4. WATER POllUTION \\nThe pollution of water supplies is widespread, affecting both developed and developing countries.\\nPoor protection of water sources and inadequate treatment of wastewater creates risks, both \\nto companies that depend on clean water for processing and manufacturing activities, as well as\\nto employees and surrounding communities. \\nBusiness Impacts:\\n\\uf0da Higher treatment costs. The cost for water utilities to clean water to acceptable levels is\\nexpected to rise in many markets, a cost that will likely be passed on to industrial customers. \\nAnd where regulations are weak, the risks of being associated with pollution incidents are driving\\nincreased investment by food and beverage companies in additional on-site wastewater treatment\\nequipment. The Coca-Cola Company has invested more than $1 billion since 2001 in wastewater\\ntreatment, working with its local bottlers worldwide to reduce their polluted discharge.43\\nRelevant financial indicators\\nHigher operating costs due to increased water or wastewater rates\\nIncreased capital expenditures on wastewater treatment and recycling technologies\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 120\\n\\u201cAs water scarcity increases, competition for water between expanding households\\n(due to expected growing urbanization) and industry will continue to reduce the\\nshare of water available for agriculture.

Unacceptable levels of pollutants can spur governments to adopt stricter\\nwater quality standards or increase enforcement. In the wake of environmental protests, China\\nintroduced new regulations in 2015 that lifted a cap on fines for environmental violations, giving\\nlocal agencies the ability to shut down or seize facilities illegally dumping or emitting pollutants, \\nand expanding the ability of different groups to sue polluters.44 A lawsuit filed by the water utility \\nfor Des Moines, Iowa is seeking to force local governments to regulate nitrogen run-off from farms,\\nwhich the utility claims is polluting its drinking water source.45\\nRelevant financial indicators\\nHigher operating costs due to higher fines or penalties\\nIncreased capital expenditures on wastewater treatment and recycling technologies \\nto ensure compliance\\nHigher cost of goods sold due to stricter regulation of agricultural water pollution\\n5. ClIMATE CHANGE & WEATHER VARIABIlITy \\nHigher temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions are dramatically speeding up the global\\nwater cycle, unleashing more extreme rainfall events and intensifying droughts, according to the\\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Climate change is predicted to fundamentally\\nalter what can be grown where, and to negatively affect overall global agricultural productivity. This\\nwill increase the prices and price volatility of agricultural inputs that are used to feed livestock\\nand as direct ingredients for the food sector.46\\nMore intense droughts will also exacerbate many of the previous risk drivers discussed, as\\nalready strained water sources become even more challenging to manage. Higher rainfall could\\nincrease the amount of agricultural and industrial run-off, as well as animal and human waste\\nflowing into rivers and lakes. \\nBusiness Impacts:\\n\\uf0da Decreased agricultural productivity. Studies modeling climate change impacts on agricultural\\nproductivity predict that the global agricultural system as a whole will have difficulty supplying\\nadequate quantities of food at constant real prices.47 Few companies grow their own inputs and\\nmargin risks rise as commodities are affected by weather-related shocks and water scarcity. Weather-\\nrelated price shocks are not new, but coupled with increased competition for water in most major\\nagricultural production regions, there often aren\\u2019t enough commodity contracts available to offset \\na company\\u2019s different exposures (Exhibit 1.5). General Mills states in its 2014 CDP water information\\nrequest that it is a large buyer of U.S. wheat and notes that \\u201cif water becomes scarcer, it will likely\\ncost more to obtain ingredients such as wheat grown in this region.\\u201d \\nSome companies are already beginning to project the impacts of climate change on their own\\nagricultural procurement costs. Unilever estimates that natural disasters linked to changing climate,\\nin particular increases in food costs, water scarcity, and reduced productivity in many parts of the\\nagricultural supply chain, cost the company around $400 million annually.48, 49\\nRelevant financial indicators\\nHigher cost of goods sold due to reduced production of key agricultural inputs\\nRevenues and projected revenues negatively affected by shortages of key ingredients\\n\\uf0da Shifting production zones & asset stranding. Oxford University estimates that as much as\\n$11.2 trillion in agricultural assets, including processing plants, transportation and distribution\\nnetworks, could be stranded annually because of environmental risks including climate change\\nand water scarcity.55 As changes in precipitation patterns make water less plentiful in certain\\ngrowing regions, farmers will adapt over the medium to long-run by shifting crops or adopting new\\nagricultural practices. In the short-term, however, crop losses could force companies to pay higher\\ntransport costs to haul inputs from longer-distances and affect the value of certain logistical and\\nprocessing assets. Prolonged droughts transformed the U.S. beef business in recent years, with\\nTexas losing 24 percent of its herd between 2010 and 2014 and Nebraska replacing Texas as \\nthe biggest beef producing state.56 This dislocation has forced companies, including Cargill and\\nNational Beef, to close massive feedlots and meatpacking plants.57\\nRelevant financial indicators\\nRevenues and projected revenue negatively affected by shifts in availability \\nand location of agricultural inputs\\nImpaired assets values due to shifts in agricultural production zones\\nImplications for the Food Sector\\nInvestors are increasingly aware of the relevance of water risks for the food sector. Analyst\\nquestions and discussions about the earnings impacts of droughts and floods are becoming more\\nroutine on food company quarterly earnings calls (Exhibit 1.6). Eighty-two percent of food sector\\ncompanies responding to the 2014 CDP information request disclosed that they are exposed \\nto water risks and that these risks could have a substantive impact on business operations.58\\nCompanies are also increasingly acknowledging these risks in their financial filings: of the 31\\ncompanies evaluated in this report that are U.S.-based and publicly held, 90 percent cite water \\nas a risk in their 10-K filings, 65 percent citing physical risks (Exhibit 1.7).\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 122\\nWheat. With just six to 18 percent of the annual global wheat crop trading \\nacross borders, weather shocks in major wheat producing countries are felt\\ndisproportionately throughout the market.50 In 2010 and 2011, severe droughts \\nin Russia and China, along with flooding and severe heat in key exporting nations,\\ncaused wheat prices to more than double to $348 a metric ton.51\\nBeef. Extreme weather globally is significantly affecting beef production, causing\\nprices to spike in 2014 to all-time highs.52 Although exports from Brazil and India\\noffset declines in Australia and U.S., potential demand increases in the emerging\\nmarkets, which are driving the long-term growth of the sector, are stymied because\\nthere simply aren\\u2019t enough cattle to slaughter. In the U.S., the world\\u2019s largest beef\\nproducer, the extended droughts in California and Texas sent the size of cattle herds\\ntumbling to historic lows in late 2014.53\\nCorn. Corn prices have increased over the last 20 years, propelled by higher\\ndemand for food, grain feed for meat production and biofuel mandates. Extreme\\nflooding in 2011, followed by the drought in the U.S. Midwest cut corn production\\nby 11 percent in 2012, causing corn prices to hit a record high, $8 a bushel.54\\nExhibit 1.5: Impacts of Weather Shocks on Commodity Prices \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 1 23\\nGiven these trends, investors should be taking into account the water dependencies and risks\\npreviously outlined when analyzing the food sector, especially in regard to scenario and sensitivity\\nanalysis or stress testing. Investors will need to model a variety of factors, including the magnitude\\nof exposure, likelihood of risks within a given scenario and time frames. Company exposure to\\nthese financial risks will vary greatly based on geographic exposure, water use intensity, agricultural\\nsupply chain mix, and level of vertical integration. In light of the above, investors seeking to\\nunderstand the potential impact of water issues to a particular company\\u2019s financial performance\\nshould consider their water dependence, the security of the water resources they rely on and the\\nquality of their management response (Exhibit 1.8).\\nUsing the Transcript Analysis function available via Bloomberg, transcripts of quarterly earnings calls for \\nthe 37 food and beverage firms addressed in this report were examined for discussion of water risks material \\nto business performance.

More frequent and intense droughts are having devastating \\neffects on harvests, while water regulations are tightening up in many growing regions.\\n\\u25cf This chapter provides guidance to investors seeking to analyze corporate exposure to agricultural\\nwater risks. Risk exposure is shaped by several factors, including the primary agricultural\\ncommodities the company buys, the level of water dependence and security associated with \\nthose commodities, as well as the sourcing model used by the company to procure inputs.\\n\\u25cf As water supplies are increasingly depleted in major agricultural regions across the planet,\\ntraditional risk management approaches such as hedging and geographic diversification are\\nbecoming less effective. Companies can achieve more by engaging directly with their supply\\nchain to strengthen farmer practices and protect the watersheds from which they source. \\nRelevant tactics include setting supplier policies and sourcing goals, purchasing certified\\nsustainable commodities, collecting data from farmers on their practices while providing\\nassistance and incentives for improvement, as well as supporting on-the-ground watershed\\nprotection projects and backing more sustainable water management regulations.\\nDroughts are increasingly affecting food production. Droughts have become more frequent and\\nintense worldwide, affecting key production regions, including the U.S. Midwest and California,\\nSouth America and Australia. In 2014, Brazil\\u2019s worst drought in decades sent coffee prices spiking\\nnine percent on average, forcing Starbucks and J.M. Smucker to pass price increases onto\\nconsumers.3, 4 When New Zealand, the world\\u2019s largest dairy products exporter, was impacted \\nby drought in 2013 whole milk powder prices skyrocketed 64 percent.5\\nWater regulations are tightening up in many growing regions. Water authorities and regulators \\nare enacting new laws to control water use, reallocate agricultural water to urban and energy \\nneeds and regulate the water quality impacts of agriculture. These regulations have obvious\\nimplications for production costs. The State of California approved a comprehensive groundwater\\nlaw in 2014 that will have long-term impacts for agriculture, giving local authorities the right to \\nset sustainability targets, restrict groundwater pumping, shut down wells and impose fines.6 Even\\nbigger changes are taking place in Australia, which has transformed its traditional water rights\\nsystem after years of drought.7 In the United States, more lawsuits are being filed over agricultural\\npollution. In a potentially precedent-setting case, a federal judge in Washington ruled in 2015 \\nfor the first time that animal waste could be regulated as solid waste and not as a beneficial farm\\nproduct, after finding that a large industrial dairy\\u2019s handling of manure had polluted drinking water.8\\nInvestor Analysis of Water Risk in Agricultural Supply Chains\\nAnalysis of water risks in corporate supply chains is complex, however the following questions and\\nresources provide guidance for evaluating these risks, taking into consideration crop, geographic\\nand sourcing model considerations (Exhibit 2.3).\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 226\\nExhibit 2.2: Irrigated Crop Production in Regions of High Water Competition\\nFifty-six percent of all irrigated crop production takes place in regions of high or extremely high water competition, or \\u201cstress.\\u201d \\nForty percent of global food production relies on irrigation. \\nSource: World Resources Institute Aqueduct, \\u201cAgricultural Exposure to Water Stress,\\u201d available at: http://www.wri.org/applications/maps/agriculturemap/#x=0.00&y=-0.00&l=2&v=home&d=gmia\\nIrrigated Agriculture\\nBrightness shows density \\nof irrigated agriculture.

For companies\\nthat raise and source livestock or dairy products, it is important to consider the crops that are used\\nto feed animals\\u2014such as corn, soybeans and alfalfa\\u2014all of which have significant water demands.\\nOf the 37 companies analyzed in this report, the top ten most commonly sourced crops are: almonds,\\ncocoa, coffee, corn, grapes, palm oil, soybean, sugarcane, tomatoes and wheat. For company-specific\\ninformation on top commodity purchases, see Chapter 3, and for information on the water risks\\nassociated with the top ten crops, see Appendix C. \\nInvestors should also consider the degree to which certain ingredients can be easily substituted.\\nFor example, sugar from a drought-impacted sugarcane-growing region could be substituted in\\nmany products with corn syrup or sugar from sugar beets\\u2014although potentially not without additional\\nlogistics or processing costs. In addition, it is important to understand how diverse or limited a crop\\u2019s\\ngrowing regions may be. For example, nearly 80 percent of global almond production comes from\\nCalifornia\\u2019s drought-stricken Central Valley. In contrast, global soybean production is more evenly\\ndistributed across several countries and continents, providing more diversification of supply.\\nKey Indicators: Agricultural Commodity Exposure\\n\\u0002 Indicator \\u0006 Data Sources\\nTop agricultural inputs 10-K filings, annual reports, sustainability reports\\n% of key agricultural inputs that are non-substitutable \\ndue to distinctive attributes (flavor, texture, association with \\na branded product\\u2014e.g. \\u201cFig Newtons\\u201d)\\nCompany product/ingredient analysis\\n# of geographies where key agricultural inputs are grown \\n(i.e. whether there are many or few production regions globally\\nfrom which the input can be procured)\\nFAO Global Production Stats9\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 228\\nWater dependence & Security of Key Agricultural Commodities\\nTo analyze commodity water risk, investors need information on the relative water dependence of \\na crop\\u2014i.e. how much water it requires to grow, as well as the associated water pollution footprint\\u2014\\ncoupled with information on the security and health of the water resources on which the crop relies.\\nAlthough growing crops and raising livestock are by their nature water-intensive activities, the\\nwater footprints of different commodities vary significantly. Animal products (meat, dairy, eggs)\\nare among the most water-intensive forms of agricultural production when requirements for growing\\nanimal feed are factored in (Exhibit 2.4). On average, 10 liters of water are needed to produce one\\ncalorie of meat; only 1.2 liters are needed for one calorie of lentils or beans, and half a liter for one\\ncalorie of root vegetables such as carrots.10\\nExhibit 2.4: Water Footprint of Major Commodities\\nBeef\\n15,415\\nCotton\\n10,000\\nChicken\\n4,325\\nEggs\\n3,300\\nRice\\n2,497\\nCorn\\n1,222\\nBananas\\n790\\nOranges\\n560\\npotatoes\\n287\\nWater Intensity (L / Kg product)\\nThe type of agricultural system used to grow crops significantly affects the water risks and\\nimpacts associated with production of that crop. Agriculture relies on water in two forms: through\\ndirect precipitation (also known as \\u201crainfed\\u201d agriculture) and irrigation systems (water delivered\\nfrom surface water sources, such as streams, rivers and lakes, or groundwater from aquifers).\\nWhile only 18 percent of cropped acres globally are irrigated, these acres represent 40 percent \\nof total food production.11\\nRainfed and irrigated agriculture have different vulnerabilities. The productivity of rainfed\\nagriculture is subject to natural variability in precipitation such as drought and flooding, and\\nincreasingly to more extreme shifts in precipitation patterns due to climate change. The long-term\\nproductivity of irrigated agriculture requires healthy, functioning watersheds, including abundant\\nstream flows and groundwater that ensure regular, dependable access to water supplies for\\nagriculture as well as other uses. \\nEighty percent of the world\\u2019s cropland and more than 60 percent of the world\\u2019s cereal grains\\nrely on rainfed production.12 In Africa, 95 percent of agricultural land is rainfed; in China 70 percent;\\nand in India 60 percent.13 The water productivity of rainfed agriculture overall tends to be low, while\\nwater losses from evaporation are high. This isn\\u2019t because of the volume of rainfall, but because \\nof soil degradation and poor methods for managing the rain when it falls, especially during floods\\nand dry spells.14\\nSource: Water Footprint Product Gallery, Water footprint Network, http://www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/productgallery\\nRainfed agriculture is especially vulnerable to climate change. Modeling of expected climate\\nchange impacts show that precipitation variability is increasing along with more extreme weather,\\naccording to the UN\\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).26 Under most climate\\nscenarios, precipitation is expected to increase in the tropics and higher latitudes, and drop further\\nin semi-arid to arid mid-latitudes and the interior of large continents, affecting key growing regions.27\\nClimate change could reduce yields of major rainfed cereal crops in Africa, including wheat yields\\nfalling as much as 35 percent south of the Sahara and corn yields dropping in excess of 30 percent\\nin South Africa and Zimbabwe by 2050.28 In Central America, the northeast of Brazil and parts of\\nthe Andes, increases in temperature and decreases in rainfall are expected to reduce crop productivity\\nfor rice, wheat and corn as well as high value commodities such as coffee.29 Nicaragua could see\\nan 80 percent decline in land suitable for coffee by 2050.30\\nThe global trend is toward more irrigated production. Irrigated production is more than twice \\nas productive on a per hectare basis than rainfed production.31 However this water use contributes\\nto significant shortages and environmental degradation in many regions: roughly 70 percent of all\\naccessible water is used for irrigation globally, though that can reach as high as 90 percent in some\\ncountries.32 As a response to climate change, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)33\\nforesees a 25 percent increase in irrigated areas in developing regions. \\nIrrigated production poses higher costs to ecosystems. Most irrigated production globally is in \\narid, dry regions threatened by drought. It also competes with other uses, is one of the most energy-\\nintensive uses of water and increases the risk of soil salinization and waterlogging. In many regions,\\nwater supplies used for agriculture are highly stressed from excessive demand and unregulated\\nuse. Combined, these pressures are leading to the drying up of water supplies in key growing\\nregions\\u2014from large-scale groundwater losses in California\\u2019s Central Valley to the disappearance \\nof Central Asia\\u2019s Aral Sea due to massive water diversions for irrigating cotton fields.34\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 2 29\\nAgriculture\\u2019s Impacts on Water Quality\\nWater pollution from farming is rising, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\\n(OECD).15 Erosion of topsoil and associated fertilizer run-off, both chemical and manure, is the most significant source of\\nagricultural water pollution. Global chemical fertilizer use, which hit 180 million tons in 2012,16 has increased 500 percent\\nover the past 50 years, with nitrogen alone growing by 800 percent.17 Because much of this fertilizer isn\\u2019t completely\\nabsorbed by plants, tens of millions of tons of nitrogen and phosphorus run off into waterways, polluting rivers,\\ngroundwater and oceans annually. The number of hypoxic \\u201cdead zones\\u201d linked to fertilizer run-off has increased\\nexponentially since the 1960s, affecting more than 400 aquatic ecosystems worldwide, including the Gulf of Mexico\\nand South China Sea.18 According to the EPA, nutrient pollution is the most significant water quality challenge\\nfacing the United States, which spends an estimated $4.8 billion annually treating nitrogen pollution.19\\nAnimal manure resulting from industrial animal production is another significant source of water pollution. In the\\nUnited States, it is estimated that livestock produce as much as 1.2 to 1.37 billion tons of waste a year and that\\nconcentrated feeding operations account for 16 percent of agricultural water pollution.20, 21 In the wake of a run-off induced\\ntoxic algae bloom in Lake Erie in summer 2014, which shut down water supplies to the city of Toledo, the Governor of\\nOhio recently signed legislation requiring dairies and livestock producers to change the way they handle manure.22\\nThe use of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides to protect crops and boost yields is also increasing, with pesticide\\nuse alone reaching 5.2 billion tons worldwide in 2007.23 Pesticides can leach into ground and surface waters and\\nhave been found in significant concentrations in many regions.24 Syngenta, the world\\u2019s largest pesticide manufacturer,\\npaid $105 million in 2012 to settle a class action suit filed by U.S. Midwest water utilities that spent millions over\\nthe years filtering the herbicide atrazine from public water supplies. Atrazine is widely used by farmers in the Corn Belt,\\nbut banned in Europe.25\\nGroundwater is an essential and increasingly imperiled source of irrigation water. Its use in\\nirrigation is increasing both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total irrigation.35 Globally, about\\n43 percent of the water used for irrigation comes from groundwater.36 Irrigation is the single largest\\nuser of groundwater in water scarce regions. An estimated 20 percent of the Earth\\u2019s groundwater\\nbasins or aquifers are being over-exploited, many of them in regions of significant agricultural\\nimportance (Exhibit 2.5).37 New satellite data in 2014 confirmed that the amount of water stored \\nin seven of the world\\u2019s major aquifers, including California\\u2019s Central Valley, the northern Middle East, \\nand the Guarani aquifer in central South America, have dropped significantly since the early 2000s.38\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 230\\nExhibit 2.5: Unsustainable Groundwater Use in Areas Important to Agriculture \\nLevels of Water Stress:\\n\\u0005 Low \\n\\u0005 Low - Medium \\n\\u0005 Medium - High \\n\\u0005 High (40-80%)\\n\\u0005 Extremely High \\n\\u0005 Arid & Low Water Use\\nA significant number of groundwater basins important to agriculture face high to extremely high stress, meaning that unsustainable groundwater \\nuse could affect groundwater availability and groundwater-dependent surface water and ecosystems. \\nKey Indicators: Water dependence & Security of Agricultural Commodities\\n\\u0002 Indicator \\u0006 Data Sources\\nRelative water requirements of key commodities Water Footprint Network\\u2019s WaterStat,39 FAO AQUASTAT, company\\nlifecycle analysis (sustainability reports), USDA Farm and Ranch\\nIrrigation Survey\\n% of agricultural spend or volume exposed \\nto drought conditions\\nU.S. Drought Monitor, WRI Aqueduct (Drought Severity data layer)\\n% of agricultural procurement spend or volume\\nassociated with rainfed versus irrigated production\\nManagement  \\n% of agricultural procurement spend or volume\\nassociated with crops grown in high water risk \\nor highly water-stressed regions\\nCDP water questionnaire; data on irrigated crops & water stress: \\nWRI Aqueduct agriculture map; for a broader set of crops and water\\nrisk indicators, see WWF Water Risk Filter & Appendix C of this report\\n% of agricultural procurement spend or volume\\ncoming from regions of groundwater depletion\\nWRI Aqueduct (Groundwater Stress data layer), USGS report:\\nGroundwater Depletion in the United States40\\n% of agricultural procurement spend or volume\\nassociated with crops that have high fertilizer \\nor pesticide use\\nManagement\\nSource: WRI Aqueduct, with underlying data from Tom Gleeson et al., \\u201cWater Balance of Global Aquifers Revealed \\nby Groundwater Footprint,\\u201d Nature, 488 (7410), 197-200, 9 August 2012.\\nAgricultural Sourcing Models\\nThe way that companies source agricultural inputs\\u2014directly from farmers, through co-ops and\\nwholesalers, or through multiple levels of intermediaries or commodities markets\\u2014shapes the \\nlevel of influence and menu of opportunities available to them for improving the sustainability \\nof farming practices.\\nAgricultural supply chains are highly complex and often lack traceability. Company influence over\\nsuppliers varies depending on the firm and the commodities. Some meat and agricultural products\\ncompanies are vertically integrated, but many food sector companies are often four-plus links from\\nthe agricultural producer. Significant traceability challenges often exist in terms of understanding the\\ngeographic origin of a particular input and what intermediaries it passes through. Companies may\\nhave a wide variety of sourcing structures for different divisions, products and manufacturing facilities.\\nThis means that a box of tea on the shelves of a supermarket may include leaves bought from many\\ndifferent international commodity traders, while another brand of tea sold by the same company may\\ncontain leaves from a specific farm or co-op that is traceable at every stage of production.\\nTraceability challenges mean that many companies may be unaware of their exposure to water-\\nrelated risks. In 2013, when horse meat was discovered in Europe in products labeled as beef,\\nincluding meatballs from Ikea and Nestl\\u00e9 frozen pasta meals, and monthly frozen burger sales\\nplunged by as much as 41 percent, the scramble to pinpoint the meat source highlighted traceability\\nissues within the food supply chain.41\\nKey Indicators: Agricultural Sourcing Models\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 2 31\\n\\u0002 Indicator \\u0006 Data Sources\\n% of agricultural procurement spend or volume sourced directly from\\nagricultural producers \\n10-K, sustainability reports, management\\n% of agricultural procurement spend or volume that is traceable down \\nto the field level (i.e. specific geographic origins of the product are known)\\nSustainability reports, management\\nApproaches to Managing Agricultural Water Risk\\nGiven the water risks associated with a company\\u2019s top agricultural commodities and its sourcing\\nmodel, companies have a range of risk management approaches available to them. However, as\\nwater supplies become overexploited in many major growing regions across the planet, traditional\\napproaches to managing commodity price risk\\u2014such as hedging and geographic diversification\\u2014\\nare becoming less effective. Companies may achieve more by working with agricultural producers to\\nlower their water impacts, while also investing to support watershed resilience in key growing regions.\\nFarm-level Practices \\nWhile global agricultural production has become dramatically more efficient and productive in many\\nregions over the past 50 years, many opportunities exist to improve soil health, further optimize resource\\nefficiency, slow or halt groundwater depletion and minimize downstream water quality impacts. Below\\nare some of the key practices that can be pursued\\u2014often at relatively low cost and with a demonstrated\\neconomic return. It should be noted that the applicability of specific practices will vary greatly depending\\non differences in crop water needs, farm size, soil types, local climates and watershed conditions.\\n\\uf0da Enhanced soil management. Soil health, defined as the continued capacity of soil to function \\nas a living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals and humans, is arguably the most important\\nindicator of agricultural resilience to drought and extremes in precipitation.42 A variety of agricultural soil\\nmanagement practices can enable soil to increase water retention during dry spells, reduce the erosion\\nimpacts of flooding and provide more productive and reliable yields. No-till farming, which involves\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 232\\nseeding directly into crop residues rather than disturbing the soil to improve soil quality and increase\\nwater infiltration, has been shown in the case of corn production to yield 24 percent more bushels per\\nacre and use 32 percent fewer gallons of water each year than conventional tilling.43 Other practices,\\nincluding cover cropping (planting non-commodity crops, such as legumes or plant grasses to protect\\nand improve the soil), and crop rotation are important tools for preventing soil erosion and supporting\\nrelationships between plants and soil microbes that improve crop uptake of water and nutrients.44\\n\\uf0da Water use productivity. Researchers have identified that in many dry regions, 40 percent \\nof total water used is being applied to fields that produce just 20 percent of total food calories.45\\nIn combination with existing rainfall, practices such as reducing soil erosion and improving soil\\nnutrients could increase annual food production in rainfed croplands by enough to feed 110 million\\npeople.46 In areas of irrigated cropland, raising the level of calories produced per drop could reduce\\nwater consumption enough to meet the annual domestic water demand of 1.4 billion people.47\\nThere are three key principles for improving water productivity at the farm and watershed level, which\\napply regardless of whether a crop is grown under rainfed or irrigated conditions: 1) increasing the\\nmarketable yield of the crop for each unit of water it consumes, 2) reducing non-beneficial water\\nconsumption, including water loss through evapotranspiration from soil or water surfaces, and 3) making\\nmore effective use of rainfall.48 A range of practices and technologies can support these principles,\\nfrom improved seeds to advanced drip irrigation to better practices for capturing and storing rainfall.49\\nIt is important to recognize that a farm-level focus on increasing water efficiency\\u2014or increasing crop\\nper drop\\u2014often results in the saved water being applied to additional agricultural uses, which can\\nfail to reduce overall withdrawals from stressed water sources.50 Without regulations that encourage\\noverall reductions in water use at the watershed level, individual field-level efficiency improvements\\nmay still contribute to depletion of water supplies and environmental degradation.\\n\\uf0da Improved fertilizer management. Some regions use too much fertilizer, while others, particularly\\nin parts of Africa, need to use more.51 Just under a quarter of the world\\u2019s cropland generates half \\nof all fertilizer waste.52 China, India and the U.S. are responsible for two-thirds of nitrogen and\\nphosphorus waste, while three crops\\u2014rice, wheat and corn\\u2014generate 60 percent of all fertilizer\\nwaste.53 Targeted cuts in fertilizer use in this small set of crops and countries could have a big\\nimpact on water pollution, without hurting yields. A recent study estimates that current crop yields\\nfor wheat, rice and corn in China, the U.S., and India, could be maintained while cutting nitrogen\\nuse by 14 to 29 percent and phosphorus by 13 to 22 percent.54 Best management practices include\\nmatching the type and amount of nutrients to each crop\\u2019s needs, careful timing of fertilization and\\ninjecting fertilizer directly into the soil.\\nCompany Practices\\nThere is much companies can do to incentivize and support farmers in adapting their practices, \\nas well as investing more broadly in the health of the watersheds from which they are sourcing. \\n\\uf0da Sustainable agriculture policies and goals. Companies send an important signal to the\\nagricultural supply chain by developing policies and setting goals that articulate an intention to\\nsource commodities that are grown with reduced water impacts. A number of food sector companies\\nincluding Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Unilever have released detailed agricultural policies while others,\\nincluding General Mills and Kellogg, have set time-bound sustainable sourcing commitments. \\n\\uf0da Data collection & benchmarking. A broad range of tools and initiatives are being created to\\nhelp track water use, fertilizer and pesticide management practices by farmers. Many companies\\nincluding Campbell Soup, PepsiCo, Sysco, Unilever and Wal-Mart are using surveys to collect\\ndata on farm-level practices and environmental impacts. Unilever, which aims to have 100 percent\\nsustainably sourced ingredients by 2020, is monitoring suppliers and farmers using a self-assessment\\nsoftware tool that collects data on compliance and tracks improvement against the goals of the\\nUnilever Sustainable Agriculture Code.55 Berry company Driscoll\\u2019s collects water use data from \\nits California Central Coast growers through an automated system which transmits data in real-time\\nfrom water meters. The data is then aggregated to provide growers with benchmark data on their\\nWithout regulations \\nthat encourage overall\\nreductions in water use\\nat the watershed level,\\nindividual field-level\\nefficiency improvements\\nmay still contribute \\nto depletion of water\\nsupplies & environmental\\ndegradation.\\nwater use versus that of other growers.56 Industry-level efforts to develop consistent data collection\\napproaches are also emerging. These include Field to Market, the Stewardship Index for Specialty\\nCrops, the Sustainability Consortium and the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy.\\n\\uf0da Commodity certification. Certification programs that provide assurance that certain aspects of\\nagricultural production are undertaken in accordance with good environmental practices are one\\nstrategy available to companies. However, lack of traceability in certain commodity markets is a\\nsignificant challenge to the broadening of certification systems beyond specialty crops. Additionally,\\nthe degree to which water quantity and water quality issues are reflected in different commodity\\ncertifications varies widely. \\n\\uf0da Agronomic assistance. Agronomic services that introduce and train farmers on practices that\\nsupport more resilient water outcomes can be provided directly by companies, their suppliers \\nor in partnership with third parties such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government\\nagencies and universities. In 2014, Unilever partnered with the Dutch NGO Solidaridad to pool\\npublic and private grants, credits and investments to promote water efficiency techniques and\\neducation among sugarcane, cotton, soy and tea farmers in India with the goal of saving 400 billion\\nto one trillion liters of water in three years.57\\n\\uf0da Financial incentives. Incentive payments, subsidies, and low-interest loan programs are\\neconomic instruments used to encourage adoption of approaches and technologies for reducing\\nwater use and fertilizer runoff. In the Irapuato region of Mexico, General Mills is providing interest-\\nfree loans to broccoli and cauliflower growers to speed up adoption of drip irrigation technology,\\nhelping save an estimated 1.1 billion gallons of water annually.58 To mitigate fears that piloting \\nnew water or nutrient and pesticide management systems will lead to lower yields, companies and\\norganizations can design programs that provide \\u201cperformance guarantees.\\u201d These guarantees offer\\nfarmers a set price regardless of yield or quality of their crops. Through the American Farmland\\nTrust\\u2019s risk-sharing programs, farmers have cut fertilizer use by 24 percent.59\\nSome companies are paying higher prices for products, particularly coffee and cocoa, grown using\\nsustainable farming approaches such as watershed management, mulching and drip irrigation. Long-\\nterm or preferential contracting is another tool. ADM, in partnership with its customer Unilever, is paying\\nIowa farmers a 10-cent a bushel premium for soybeans from farms enrolled in the Field to Market\\nprogram, which helps farmers evaluate ways to reduce the environmental impacts of their practices.60\\n\\uf0da Watershed protection and public policy engagement. Most agricultural water challenges are\\ncollective, and solving them requires shared action by all stakeholders, as well as government\\npolicies that support conservation, water quality improvements and integrated water management.\\nCompanies can play a role in collaborative efforts to protect and restore agricultural watersheds \\nby providing direct investments in on-the ground projects that improve local conditions and ensure\\nlong-term continuity of agricultural production. Companies can also actively support government\\npolicies that achieve sustainable water use in the regions where they source. For example, Coca-\\nCola, Driscoll\\u2019s and General Mills are members of the Connect the Drops campaign, a business\\nadvocacy initiative that supports sustainable water management policies in California.61\\nKey Indicators: Managing Agricultural Water Risk\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 2 33\\n\\u0002 Indicator \\u0006 Data Sources\\n% of producers in supply chain showing continuous improvement on water-related outcomes\\n(water use productivity, nutrient application, soil health, etc.)\\nCompany has a sustainable agriculture policy & time-bound sourcing goals that address water\\nCompany gathers data from agricultural producers on the water impacts of their farming practices\\nCompany offers educational support, technology or financial incentives to agricultural\\nproducers in supply chain to improve water management\\nCompany sources certified commodities, where relevant\\nCompany has collaborative, watershed protection plans that are linked to sourcing regions \\nof high water risk\\nChapters 3 & 4 \\nof this report,\\nsustainability\\nreports, CDP\\u2019s \\nwater questionnaire,\\nmanagement\\nMethodology\\nThirty-seven major food companies in four industries were evaluated for their strength in managing\\nwater risks across their direct operations and supply chains.

For a more\\nin-depth discussion of results within each water management category, see Chapter 4.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 3 41\\nOverall performance\\nEvidence of strong water management response by some companies, but relatively weak\\nperformance overall. Top performers by industry were: \\nPackaged Food\\n\\u2014 70 points \\u2014\\nUnilever\\nBeverage\\n\\u2014 67 points \\u2014\\nThe Coca-Cola\\nCompany\\nMeat\\n\\u2014 33 points \\u2014\\nSmithfield Foods\\nAgricultural Products\\n\\u2014 29 points \\u2014\\nBunge\\nCompanies in the packaged food and beverage industries had stronger overall performance\\nthan meat and agricultural products companies. The packaged food and beverage industries\\nhad median scores of 27 and 26.5, respectively, while agricultural products and meat companies\\nwere 13.5 and 10, respectively. \\nCorporate Governance of Water Risk\\n\\uf0da Water risk is a corporate governance priority for many of the companies evaluated.\\nForty-three percent (19) of companies across all four industries have oversight for water risk at\\nthe board level. Fifty-one percent of companies have senior level management oversight of water risk.\\n\\uf0da Despite this, strong board oversight did not consistently translate into strong overall performance.\\nOf the 16 companies with board oversight, most performed poorly overall, with more than 60 percent\\nreceiving fewer than 35 total points. \\n\\uf0da Few companies tie water performance to executive compensation. Molson Coors and Campbell\\u2019s\\nare among four companies that offer explicit financial incentives to executive officers and the \\nCEO for water-related performance. \\n\\uf0da Only two companies report using a shadow price of water to analyze the ROI of water-\\nefficiency investments. In most of the world, water is low-cost or free for industry, failing to reflect\\nits true scarcity and value. Anticipating future price hikes, both Unilever and Nestl\\u00e9 use a shadow\\nprice for water to calculate the return of efficiency investments while also meeting hurdle rates.\\nNestl\\u00e9 places a theoretical price on water depending on the water stress of a factory location \\nto help the company better prioritize investments in high water risk regions. \\n\\uf0da Only seven companies\\u2014all of them in the packaged food and beverage industries\\u2014acknowledged\\nthat access to drinking water and sanitation are fundamental human rights.3 Having provided\\nformal recognition that water is a human right as voted upon by the United Nations (UN) General\\nAssembly in 2010, some companies are following suit by evaluating the human rights impacts \\nof their water management practices. \\n\\uf0da Few companies are actively supporting reform of public policies that would result in more\\nsustainable water management. Given generally weak water governance in high water stress\\nregions throughout the world, there is a business interest in advocating for much needed water\\nreforms. Coca-Cola and General Mills are members of the Connect the Drops campaign4\\na business advocacy initiative organized by Ceres that supports more sustainable water\\nmanagement policies in the state of California. \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 342\\ndirect Operations\\n\\uf0da A majority of companies (23) have begun to evaluate water risks in their direct operations,\\nbut two-thirds (22) are still not evaluating water issues in their agricultural supply chains.\\nCoca-Cola, PepsiCo and Unilever are among the few companies that conducted comprehensive\\nwater risks assessments throughout their operations and supply chains.  \\n\\uf0da Nearly one-third of companies (11) fail to report basic water data. While half the companies\\nreported data on overall water use, few reported a full range of water accounting data. Brown-\\nForman, ConAgra and Kellogg are among the companies reporting the most data for their facilities.\\n\\uf0da 70 percent (26) have set targets to reduce water use in their direct operations, but the\\naggressiveness of these targets varies. Molson Coors has set risk-differentiated targets, requiring\\nthat all its breweries in high water risk regions achieve higher water efficiency levels than breweries\\nin less stressed locations. \\n\\uf0da Water quality issues get less priority, with only two companies reporting goals to reduce\\nwastewater discharges and improve water quality beyond compliance requirements. Coca-\\nCola has a global wastewater standard for its facilities that sets a limit for maximum loading\\nvalues for major contaminants, unless more stringent regulatory standards apply. Nestl\\u00e9 has \\na goal to implement new requirements for water quality and effluent discharge in its factories.\\nThe company has initiated a survey to identify gaps in existing wastewater treatment\\ninfrastructure and established targeted investments in the facilities that need it most. \\n\\uf0da Only a few companies\\u2014Coca-Cola, General Mills and Molson Coors\\u2014have developed\\ncollaborative watershed protection plans in high water risk regions. Collaborative efforts that\\nseek to restore watershed functions and invest in highest-return water conservation opportunities\\nallow companies to help mitigate collective water risks, often at a lower cost than would be\\nrequired to drive further operational efficiencies.\\nManufacturing Supply Chain\\n\\uf0da Nearly one-quarter of companies (9) ask manufacturing suppliers to report on water use,\\nwastewater discharge and management practices. General Mills and Campbell Soup ask\\nsuppliers to complete supplier scorecards that include water use sections. Hershey and\\nUnilever use Sedex (a platform for sharing supply chain data) to query suppliers on water\\nmanagement, use and risks. \\n\\uf0da Only five companies require their manufacturing suppliers to establish their own water\\nmanagement programs. Coca-Cola requires its bottling suppliers to complete a source water\\nvulnerability assessment that evaluates risks to the company and surrounding communities,\\nand to develop and implement source water protection plans.\\nAgricultural Supply Chain\\n\\uf0da Only six companies have a sustainable agriculture policy that addresses water. PepsiCo\\u2019s\\npolicy includes the objective to \\u201coptimize the applied water footprint to crops and to reduce water\\nwaste during irrigation as well as responsibly manage runoff risks of pollution or contamination\\nof ground or surface water with pesticides, nutrients or soil.\\u201d5 Unilever has an Agricultural Code\\nof Conduct that includes an entire section focused on water use and pollution and defines practices\\nwith which agricultural producers are expected to comply. \\n\\uf0da Despite the lack of policies, 41 percent (15) of companies have set time-bound goals \\nto source agricultural products more sustainably. For many companies, however, these\\ncommitments were limited to only one or two commodities. Only two meat companies had\\ngoals. Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kellogg and Unilever are the only companies that have set\\ntime-bound goals to source the majority of their agricultural inputs sustainably.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 3 43\\n\\uf0da 43 percent (16) of companies gather data from agricultural producers on the water impacts \\nof their farming practices. ADM, Bunge, Coca-Cola and Kellogg are collecting data from \\nsome producers through their participation in Field to Market. Some Brown-Forman growers \\nare reporting water data through self-assessments as members of the California Sustainable\\nWinegrowing Alliance (CSWA) and the Wine Institute. \\n\\uf0da One-third (12) of companies provide educational support to growers through tools, advising\\nand training programs. Molson Coors has developed a tool to support UK barley growers\\nin assessing their water use and finding ways to save money and manage water holistically. \\nJBS offers consultations with technicians to support producers in implementing rainwater harvesting,\\nbiodigesting and composting initiatives. ConAgra provides support to potato growers through a\\nprogram that allows them to self-evaluate their farming operations, compare themselves to other\\ngrowers and identify practices they can implement to improve their performance.\\n\\uf0da Only four companies offer financial support to help growers farm more sustainably.\\nWhiteWave\\u2019s Horizon Organic Producer Education (HOPE) program invests directly in growers\\nlooking to transition to organic farming. General Mills provides Mexican growers with interest-\\nfree loans to invest in more efficient drip irrigation.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 444\\nBenchmark Results: Findings \\nby Water Management Category\\nCHApTER 4\\nExhibit 4.1: Governance & Management Performance\\n25\\n20\\n15\\n10\\n5\\n0\\npo\\nin\\nts\\nKey\\nMaximum \\u00ae\\nMinimum \\u00ae\\nMedian \\u00ae\\nMAxIMUM POINTS\\npackaged FoodMeatBeverageAgricultural products\\nCategory: Governance & Management\\nThis category assesses the level of board and senior management oversight of water-related issues,\\nties between executive compensation and water performance, and key business planning activities\\nthat take water into account.

While many of these companies disclosed to CDP that their boards have oversight \\nof water-related risks, none of their board committee charters made explicit reference to water.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 4 45\\nExhibit 4.2: Companies with Board Oversight\\nAgricultural products\\nBeverage\\nMeat\\npackaged Food\\n(3)\\n(2)\\n(2)\\n(9)\\n50%\\n33%\\n33%\\n47%\\n0% 100%\\nOnly three of the companies disclosed that company executives regularly brief the board on\\nwater-related issues. Board briefings send a clear signal to investors that board oversight is more\\nthan a formality and directors are playing a more active role in overseeing water-related risks. \\nSenior Executive Oversight\\nFor half (19) of the companies evaluated, management-level oversight for water was relegated\\nto executives at least two levels below the CEO (Exhibit 4.3). Twelve of the 37 companies indicated\\nthat oversight for water management lay with an individual who reported directly to the CEO or\\nChairman. Oversight for water at Smithfield falls under the responsibility of the Chief Sustainability\\nOfficer, who reports directly to the CEO and sits on the leadership team. At Keurig, the company\\u2019s\\nChief Strategy and Sustainability Officer has responsibility for social and environmental initiatives\\nand reports directly to the President and CEO. \\nBoard Committee\\nwith Oversight \\nfor Environment \\nor Sustainability:\\n\\u2022 Bunge\\n\\u2022 Chiquita Brands\\n\\u2022 The Coca-Cola\\nCompany\\n\\u2022 ConAgra Foods\\n\\u2022 dean Foods\\n\\u2022 dr. pepper \\nSnapple Group\\n\\u2022 General Mills\\n\\u2022 Ingredion\\n\\u2022 JBS\\n\\u2022 Kellogg\\n\\u2022 Keurig Green Mountain\\n\\u2022 Mead Johnson\\n\\u2022 Mondele\\u02c9z\\nInternational\\n\\u2022 pepsiCo \\n\\u2022 Smithfield \\n\\u2022 Unilever \\nWater Tied to Executive Compensation\\nFour of the 37 companies\\u2014all within the packaged food and beverage industries\\u2014incorporate\\nwater explicitly as part of their executive compensation structure, specifically with respect to\\nvariable compensation (Exhibit 4.4). \\nExhibit 4.3: Companies with Senior Executive Oversight\\nAgricultural products\\nBeverage\\nMeat\\npackaged Food\\n(2)\\n(5)\\n(2)\\n(10)\\n83%\\n33%\\n53%\\n0% 100%\\n33%\\nPercent of Companies\\nPercent of Companies\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 446\\nExhibit 4.4: Water Tied to Executive Compensation\\nCampbell Soup Campbell\\u2019s has \\u201cbrought corporate social responsibility into our executive compensation system andincluded important metrics on energy, water, waste, safety and ethics.\\u201d1\\ndean Foods At Dean Foods, CEO and executive officers receive a financial incentive for achieving sustainability goals, which include a \\u201cwater per gallon\\u201d key performance indicator.\\nMolson Coors Molson Coors offers monetary rewards to the CEO, the management group and business unit managersbased on performance of \\u201cwater consumption per hl [hectoliter] of production metric.\\u201d\\nUnilever CEO\\u2019s personal performance goals and bonus are linked to progress on the company\\u2019s CSR goals and itsSustainable Living Plan.\\nConsiders Water in Strategy & Business planning\\nOnly 30 percent (11) of companies indicated that water risks were considered as part of major\\nbusiness planning activities and investment decision-making. Mead Johnson, for example, \\nstates that \\u201cwe consider the availability of water when selecting new business locations, and we \\nseek to achieve efficient use of water resources at all our facilities worldwide.\\u201d2 Constellation takes\\nthis a step further by disclosing that it conducts water risk assessments for all new acquisitions \\nand expansions of existing facilities. \\nAlthough water is notoriously underpriced in most markets, Nestl\\u00e9 and Unilever are the only\\ncompanies in this assessment that disclose using a \\u201ctrue\\u201d cost for water for key business planning\\ndecisions.

Four companies reported absolute reduction\\ntargets, while the rest reported normalized or eco-efficiency targets. Companies with the strongest targets\\nused a risk-differentiated approach, which involved setting more aggressive targets for regions or facilities\\nfacing higher levels of water stress or risk. Two companies\\u2014Molson Coors and Nestl\\u00e9\\u2014reported risk-\\ndifferentiated targets. Molson Coors has an overall target to reduce water intensity by 15 percent by\\n2020 from a 2011 baseline, and requires that all its breweries in high water risk regions achieve \\n\\u201ca world class water efficiency [ratio] of 3.0 to 3.5 hl/hl depending on the complexity of the brewery.\\u201d3\\nExhibit 4.8: Water Reduction Targets\\nAgricultural products\\nBeverage\\nMeat\\npackaged Food\\n(5)\\n(4)\\n(3)\\n(14)\\n83%\\n67%\\n50%\\n74%\\n0% 100%Percent of Companies\\nPercent of Companies\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 4 49\\nWatershed protection plans\\nWater is a shared resource and presents a shared risk to the many users\\u2014industry, cities and farmers\\u2014that depend\\non it. For companies, even achieving best-in-class facility level water efficiency may not be sufficient to mitigate\\nthe physical, regulatory or reputational risks that result from the broader mismanagement of local water resources. \\nIn many regions of the world, collaborative efforts to protect and restore watersheds are a critical approach for\\ncatalyzing the public and private investment needed to improve the conditions of rivers, lakes, groundwater and\\nrelated ecosystems on which a company\\u2019s facilities and supply chains depend. Some companies are developing\\nwatershed protection plans that focus targeted corporate resources on various activities\\u2014river restoration and aquifer\\nreplenishment projects, among others\\u2014typically in areas of high water risk and in partnership with local stakeholders.\\nThis approach allows various stakeholders to share the burden of what is often a complex, resource-intensive task.\\nOnly four of the companies\\u2014Coca-Cola, General Mills, Molson Coors and pepsiCo\\u2014have developed watershed\\nprotection plans for their direct operations. Of these, two have plans that extend beyond watersheds associated with their\\ndirect operations to include those of key manufacturing suppliers or agricultural sourcing regions.  \\nGeneral Mills has established watershed stewardship plans for key at-risk regions, which the company identified\\nin partnership with The Nature Conservancy. Priority watersheds include a growing region in Irapuato, Mexico,\\nwhere vegetables are grown and packaged, as well as a growing region in the Snake River region of Idaho where\\nagricultural producers grow wheat for the company. In addition to identifying current and future risks to these\\nwatersheds, General Mills seeks to identify stakeholders that are contributing to the depletion and pollution of \\nthe watersheds as well as opportunities for collaboration through education and advocacy efforts.\\nWastewater Reduction Targets\\nMost companies assessed do not disclose the percentage of their facilities that are in compliance\\nwith local wastewater discharge regulations.

In this water management category, companies were assessed on\\nhow they are evaluating, influencing and supporting their manufacturing suppliers\\u2014typically tier 1\\nsuppliers that process agricultural and other inputs\\u2014to better manage water risk and improve\\nwater management practices.  \\nOverall performance within this category was quite poor, with only 10 companies achieving more\\nthan five points for the category (Exhibit 4.9).  \\nManufacturing \\nSupply Chain\\nTop Performer \\nTotal Points Available in \\nAgricultural Products \\n& Meat: \\n15/100\\nPackaged Food \\n& Beverage:\\n20/100\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 450\\nExhibit 4.9: Manufacturing Supply Chain Performance\\n20\\n15\\n10\\n5\\n0\\npo\\nin\\nts\\nBeverage Meatpackaged Food Agricultural products\\nSupplier Codes & policies\\nNearly two-thirds (23) of the companies evaluated had a public supplier policy or code requiring\\nmanufacturing suppliers to be in environmental regulatory compliance (Exhibit 4.10).

Understanding the agricultural water management practices of farmers is critical for influencing\\nsustainable food production. Finding appropriate ways to invest in agricultural suppliers is essential:\\nmany agricultural producers do not have the financial resources or expertise to adequately address\\nwater and other sustainability risks without external support. \\nIn this water management category, companies were assessed on how they are evaluating, influencing\\nand supporting agricultural producers in their supply chains to better manage water risk and\\nimprove water-related practices.

These goals have varying\\nlevels of strength, with many focusing on only one commodity that makes up a relatively small\\npercentage of a company\\u2019s total procurement spend. Smithfield, for example, has a specific goal\\nrelated to the sustainability of the grain it sources to feed its hogs. By 2018, it seeks to \\u201chave 75 percent\\nof its Southeast [U.S.] grain-sourcing acres participate in a fertilizer optimization and soil health\\nprogram.\\u201d8 In 2015, the company plans to expand this goal to grain purchased in the U.S. Midwest.\\nConAgra and Hain Celestial are among a growing number of companies with time-bound goals to\\nsource 100 percent of their palm oil from certified sustainable sources. \\nOf the 15 companies with time-bound sourcing goals, only four\\u2014Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kellogg,\\nand Unilever\\u2014have goals that apply to the majority of their agricultural purchases. Kellogg and\\nGeneral Mills have committed to sourcing 100 percent of their 10 key agricultural inputs sustainably\\nby 2020. In these cases, the companies\\u2019 definition of \\u201csustainably\\u201d varies significantly by commodity,\\nbut for most ingredients, water efficiency and water quality are among the metrics used to benchmark\\nimprovement in farming practices.  \\nCollecting data from Agricultural producers\\n43 percent (16) of companies (most in the packaged food and beverage sectors) are collecting\\ndata on water management practices and performance from agricultural producers in their\\nsupply chains (Exhibit 4.12). For most companies, the data collected is often from a very narrow\\nsubset of their overall production base. \\nSome companies gather data from producers directly through audits. Nestl\\u00e9 conducts responsible\\nsourcing audits for tier 1 suppliers (which includes some agricultural producers) and requires all\\nother upstream suppliers to be in compliance with the company\\u2019s Responsible Sourcing Guidelines,\\na 20-page document that lays out detailed environmental and social requirements on 12 key\\ncommodities.9 Based on these audits, the company discloses that 17 percent of the volume of \\nits key commodities are currently responsibly sourced in accordance with Nestl\\u00e9\\u2019s guidelines. \\nNumerous companies are members of Field to Market, a multi-stakeholder initiative that is creating\\nenvironmental performance metrics for U.S. commodity crops. Growers participating in Field to\\nMarket are using the initiative\\u2019s \\u201cFieldprint Calculator\\u201d to collect data and monitor their water\\nmanagement practices. Kellogg and Bunge, together with the Nature Conservancy, are asking U.S.\\ncorn growers to use Field to Market metrics to monitor their on-farm practices. ADM, which supplies\\nsoybeans for Unilever\\u2019s Hellmann\\u2019s Mayonnaise, has enrolled soybean growers in Iowa to begin\\nreporting key environmental metrics, which are anonymously aggregated and shared with Unilever.10\\nExhibit 4.12: Policies and Programs to Improve Agricultural Suppliers\\u2019 Water Performance \\npolicy for Sustainable Agricultural Sourcing\\nTime-Bound Goals to Source Agricultural\\nInputs More Sustainably\\nGathers data from producers\\nprocures Commodities from Certified Sources\\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\\n\\u0005 = Agricultural products\\n\\u0005 = Beverage\\n\\u0005 = Meat\\n\\u0005 = packaged Food\\nPercent of Companies\\npurchasing Certi\\ufb01ed Commodities \\nA majority of companies (70 percent) source at least one agricultural commodity from certified\\nsources (Exhibit 4.12). Examples range from companies that are only sourcing certified sustainable\\npalm oil, which may make up less than one percent of their company\\u2019s procurement purchases, \\nto companies that are sourcing a range of certified commodities such as coffee, tea and chocolate\\nthat make up a much larger percentage of their overall procurement spend. Hain Celestial was \\nthe only company that sources certified inputs for more than 50 percent of its procurement spend\\n(60 percent of Hain Celestial\\u2019s products are certified organic).\\nIt is important to note that many agricultural certification programs do not comprehensively address\\nrelevant water risks and impacts. Some have much more in-depth requirements that take a range\\nof social and environmental factors into account, while others are much more limited in their scope.\\nGoing forward, water-focused efforts such as the Alliance for Water Stewardship\\u2019s new certification\\nstandard will likely be of growing relevance to agricultural certification.11\\nIncentivizing Agricultural producers \\nMany producers lack information, training or financial incentives that may be needed to adjust their\\nfarming practices in ways that reduce water risks and impacts. Producers may view adopting new\\nfarming practices that contribute to higher water efficiency or reduced impacts on water quality as \\na financially risky endeavor, due to real or perceived uncertainty about a practice\\u2019s effectiveness and\\nreturn on investment. Corporate buyers can play an important role\\u2014both directly and in partnership\\nwith supply chain partners, government, NGOs and academia\\u2014to channel appropriate educational\\nresources and financial incentives that help producers manage these risks and take on new practices.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 4 53\\nThe Complexities of Farm-level data Collection\\nAs companies seek to better evaluate water risks and identify ways to catalyze improvements in water management \\nat the farm level, data on the performance of agricultural producers is increasingly valuable. There can be significant\\nchallenges in gathering this data, however, due to traceability challenges in agricultural supply chains, as well as privacy\\nconcerns on the part of producers. Approaches to gathering this data vary\\u2014and include audits, surveys and anonymous\\nreporting through third-party databases\\u2014often depending on a company\\u2019s location in the value chain and the\\nnature of its relationships with producers. One major point of differentiation in data collection relates to whether\\nthe information gathered is focused on farming practices (e.g. no-till agriculture, use of drip irrigation) or on the\\nspecific environmental outcomes that these practices can lead to (e.g. improvements in soil health, reductions in\\ngroundwater withdrawals). The latter sort of information can be more useful for driving investment decision-making\\nand on-the-ground improvements, while the former can be easier to collect and validate. \\nCompanies and investors should consider the potential reporting burden from new data collection processes, particularly\\non growers with limited resources. They should carefully weigh the pros and cons of their data collection approach and\\ngauge whether there are ways to support growers in streamlining the data collection process through IT solutions, aligning\\nwith multi-stakeholder indicator efforts, and providing other forms of technical support. Additionally, data collection\\nshould not be viewed as a compliance or \\u201ctick-box\\u201d exercise, but should be used in ways that provide real value to\\nproducers, such as providing them with a benchmark of their performance against similar producers in their region.\\nFinally, farm-level data collection has limitations if indicators like water use are not considered in the context of\\nlocal watershed conditions. Highly efficient producers may use their water savings in one field to expand production\\nin another, potentially still depleting water sources. In addition, the water savings achieved by more efficient\\nfarmers can be easily overwhelmed by poor performance by neighboring farmers, thus failing to reduce overall \\nwater supply risk in a growing region.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 454\\nNearly half (18) of the companies evaluated provide some form of support to growers through\\neducation and training or financial incentives. Twelve companies reported providing direct\\neducational or agronomic resources to producers to encourage adoption of practices that reduce\\nimpacts on water. \\nUnilever directly engages with farmers in India, Turkey, China, Tanzania and Kenya to provide\\nguidance on a range of issues, including efficient use of drip irrigation and prudent pesticide use.\\nUnilever also \\u201cshare(s) our expertise on soil and irrigation management, water reuse and rainwater\\nharvesting techniques with our suppliers, so that they know what they can do to make improvements.\\nFor example, we know that applying irrigation only when crops need it and in the right amounts,\\nenhancing soil structure to increase its holding capacity and collecting water from rooftops and \\nrun-off can help farmers use water efficiently and can also help improve crop yields.\\u201d12\\nIn 2010, PepsiCo established its Sustainable Farming Initiative, a global program to help the\\ncompany measure the impacts of its agricultural supply chain against a range of environmental,\\nsocial and economic indicators, including soil moisture, water, management practices and\\nemployment conditions. The program provides support to oat, citrus, potato, rice and corn growers.\\nAs a part of this program, PepsiCo partnered with the UK\\u2019s Cambridge University to develop \\u201ci-crop,\\u201d\\na web-based platform to help PepsiCo growers monitor and manage water and carbon emissions\\nand improve crop yield and quality.13\\nEleven companies reported funding external programs and projects to help advance water\\nsustainability by farmers in their supply chains. Mondele\\u00afz, for example, is funding NGOs that\\nprovide tools and training to cocoa growers to strengthen agricultural management practices\\u2014\\nincluding limiting fertilizer and pesticide use and protecting water resources.\\nOnly a handful of companies\\u2014General Mills, Keurig, Unilever and WhiteWave\\u2014reported\\nproviding direct financial support to producers. Examples include premiums for more sustainably\\ngrown inputs; favorable financing terms or interest-free loans offered for equipment; and financial\\nguarantees. Unilever has established the Knorr Sustainability Partnership Fund that invests 50\\npercent in innovative projects that accelerate the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices.14\\nCompanies that\\nprovide Financial\\nIncentives to\\nGrowers for Better\\nWater Management\\n\\u2022 General Mills \\n\\u2022 Keurig Green\\nMountain\\n\\u2022 Unilever\\n\\u2022 WhiteWave Foods\\nCompany Recommendations  \\n1. Increase board oversight and understanding of material water risks. Corporate board members\\nhave a fiduciary duty for risk management oversight. While 43 percent (19) of the companies\\nevaluated in this report have board committees charged with environmental oversight, this oversight\\ndid not consistently translate into strong water management performance. Board charters should\\nbe strengthened to explicitly mention water. Additionally, board members should be regularly\\nbriefed by management on water-related risks, and provided with opportunities to engage with\\nexternal water experts.\\n2. Conduct robust water risk analysis. Many of the companies assessed in this report had relatively\\nweak systems\\u2014if any at all\\u2014for collecting and interpreting data on the severity of their exposure\\nto water risks. Companies should accelerate risk assessment, including analysis of their\\nmanufacturing and agricultural supply chains. When conducting water risk analysis, companies\\nshould bear in mind the various kinds of water risks to which they may be exposed (e.g. physical\\nscarcity risks and quality risks, regulatory risks, social license to operate risks), use forward-\\nlooking models or scenarios to identify the likelihood and severity of future risks, and use robust\\ndatasets to support this analysis (see Appendix D).\\n3. Address watershed-level risks. Most food sector companies are limiting their investments \\nin water risk mitigation to improving facility- or field-level water use efficiencies and meeting\\nregulatory compliance standards. While these efforts are important, even achieving best-in-class\\nwater use efficiency may not be sufficient to mitigate the physical, regulatory or reputational\\nrisks resulting from the broader mismanagement of local water resources. A narrow operational\\nfocus may also overlook lower-cost, higher-return opportunities to work collaboratively to reduce\\nrisk through activities that protect and restore watersheds. Companies should develop water risk\\nmitigation plans that incorporate targeted investments to improve the conditions of the most \\nat-risk watersheds on which their facilities and supply chains depend. Companies should also\\nconsider opportunities to align public policy positions and lobbying activities in ways that encourage\\ngovernment officials to implement more sustainable water management policies.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter 5 55\\nRecommendations \\nfor Companies & Investors\\nGiven the growing materiality of water risks to the food sector, both investors and companies\\nmust act to mitigate short-term risks and foster long-term solutions that ensure sustainable \\nfood and water supplies.\\nCHApTER 5\\n4. Tackle water risks and impacts in agricultural supply chains. As water supplies are increasingly\\ndepleted and polluted in major agricultural regions across the world, traditional risk management\\napproaches such as hedging and geographic diversification are becoming less effective.\\nCompanies can achieve more by engaging directly with their supply chain to strengthen farmer\\npractices and protect the watersheds. Key strategies include setting sustainable agriculture\\npolicies and time-bound sourcing goals, purchasing certified sustainable commodities where\\nrelevant, and collecting data from farmers on their practices while providing assistance and\\nincentives for improvement.\\n5. Improve disclosure. Companies need to disclose to investors their exposure to water risk, as well as\\nstrategies and progress made in mitigating such risks. As much as possible, data should be reported\\nat the facility or regional level. Companies publicly-listed in the United States are required by the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to disclose to shareholders financially material risks\\nrelated to climate change and water in their operations and supply chains.1 Additionally, investors\\nexpect companies to provide more detailed disclosure of risks and mitigation strategies through\\ntheir corporate sustainability reports and in responses to CDP\\u2019s annual water information request.  \\nInvestor Recommendations\\n1. Analyze corporate water risk in terms of water dependence, security and response. When\\nevaluating a company\\u2019s overall risk, use the information and data resources suggested in this\\nreport to capture corporate water dependence (the amount of water needed for a company\\u2019s\\ndirect operations and supply chain, as well as the volumes and intensity of associated wastewater\\nthat must be assimilated by a receiving water body); the security of the water resources they \\nrely on; and the quality of management response to those risks.\\n2. Go beyond direct operations to consider supply chain water risks. While most companies \\nin the food sector are not directly involved in agricultural production, many are significantly\\nexposed to agricultural water risks through their suppliers. When analyzing water risks embedded\\nin agricultural supply chains, consider that risk exposure is shaped by several factors, including\\nthe primary agricultural commodities the company buys, the level of water dependence and\\nsecurity associated with those commodities, as well as the sourcing model used by the company\\nto procure agricultural inputs.  \\n3. Engage underperforming companies. Investors should engage portfolio companies on how they\\nmanage water risks. As a result of poor disclosure by many companies in the sector, investors need\\nto engage directly with corporate management to gather relevant information and encourage future\\ndisclosure. In addition to direct engagement, consider leveraging existing collaborative investor\\nefforts that engage companies on water, such as Ceres\\u2019 Investor Network, the United Nations-\\nsupported Principles for Responsible Investment\\u2019s (UNPRI) \\u201cWater Risks in Agricultural Supply\\nChains\\u201d group, and the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility\\u2019s (ICCR) Water & Food group.2\\n4. Integrate information from water risk analysis and corporate engagement into buy/sell\\ndecisions and beyond. Taking into account unique investor objectives, possible approaches\\ninclude embedding water analysis into overall environmental, social and governance scores;\\naltering the size of the investment universe to either avoid high water risk industries or companies,\\nor include companies with a strong management response; and embedding water risk analysis\\nin scenario analysis in financial models. Investors can conduct portfolio-level analysis of exposure to\\nhigh water risk regions, companies or agricultural activities. It is also beneficial to analyze cross-\\nasset class exposure, from equities and fixed income to commodities and farmland funds. For\\nother approaches and more details, see Ceres\\u2019 Investor Handbook for Water Risk Integration.3\\n5. Support efforts to increase and standardize food sector reporting on water. While some food\\nsector companies had robust disclosure, most did not, with some companies failing to report\\nbasic information on their water use and only 43 percent providing data to CDP\\u2019s 2014 water\\ninformation request. Investors should encourage company reporting to CDP, and also support\\nimprovements to the survey to ensure that more comparable, industry-relevant data is requested\\nfrom food sector companies. Investors may also wish to engage the Sustainability Accounting\\nStandards Board (SASB) on food sector water metrics.4\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Chapter.556\\nMethodology  \\nCeres used a systematic method for evaluating and scoring the water risk management practices \\nof each of the 37 companies assessed. This methodology uses publicly available information and \\nis grounded in the Ceres Aqua Gauge,1 a framework that was developed in 2011 by Ceres, WBCSD,\\nIRRC and Irbaris in consultation with 50 investors, companies and NGOs. The Aqua Gauge was\\ndeveloped to aid investors in evaluating the water management activities of corporations in a range\\nof sectors against detailed definitions of leading practice. For the purpose of this analysis, these\\ndefinitions were modified to enhance their relevance to the unique water use characteristics of \\nthe food sector. \\nESG investment research firm Sustainalytics supported the analysis by leading the data collection\\nprocess, providing guidance on the methodology development, and synthesizing initial findings. \\nHow Companies Were Selected\\nThe 37 companies evaluated in this report fall within the food products and beverage industries, \\nas defined by the Global Industry Classification System (GICS).  \\nThe companies evaluated represented the largest packaged food, beverage, meat and agricultural\\nproducts firms listed in either the S&P 500 and/or the Russell 1000 indices as of July 2014. In\\naddition, a few large companies that are either listed on different indices or are privately held were\\nincluded in the analysis to provide a more comprehensive universe for benchmarking.    \\ndata Sources\\nFor each company, only publicly available information was used for the assessment. Any company\\ndisclosures made publicly available after November 15, 2014 were not included in this assessment. \\nThe following documents were reviewed:\\n\\u25cf Voluntary corporate disclosures such as sustainability or corporate social responsibility (CSR)\\nreports, press releases, and company websites.\\n\\u25cf Company responses to the CDP 2014 water information request.\\n\\u25cf In instances where companies did not receive or did not respond to the CDP 2014 water\\ninformation request, Sustainalytics also looked for relevant information reported to the CDP\\n2014 supply chain information request, the CDP 2014 climate change information request, \\nand in some cases CDP 2013 water information request.

For non-U.S.\\ncompanies, the company\\u2019s annual report was reviewed in place of the 10-K.\\ndata Collection process & Quality Control\\nThere were multiple rounds of data collection and review. The first level of the data collection,\\nwhich included an internal review of all companies evaluated, was conducted by Sustainalytics\\nbetween November 3-15, 2014. Ceres conducted a second round of review and data collection\\nand made minor adjustments to the framework to ensure clarity and consistency in evaluation\\nacross industries. Sustainalytics incorporated this review into the assessment and completed\\nanother round of data collection for key indicators that had been adjusted. \\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Appendix A 57\\nAppEndIx A\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Appendix A58\\nIn addition to conducting a final review of each company assessment, Ceres conducted a number\\nof quality assurance checks of key indicators across companies evaluated. Through these checks,\\nCeres was able to ensure that companies were evaluated and scored consistently within different\\nindicators and sub-indicators. \\nIndicators & Weights\\nCompany scores are based on the findings of 11 indicators and 44 sub-indicators that fall within\\nfour water management categories: governance & management, direct operations, manufacturing\\nsupply chain and agricultural supply chain (Exhibit A.2). One hundred points were allocated at the\\nsub-indicator level and roll up into total indicator scores, total water management category scores\\nand total overall company scores. \\nDue to differences in the operational structure of different industries, point allotments for indicators\\nand water management categories vary slightly by industry. Meat and agricultural products companies\\nare more likely to have direct contractual arrangements with agricultural producers or co-ops, and thus\\nhave a different level of influence with respect to their water management practices. As a result, more\\npoints were allocated to the agricultural supply chain category for these industries. Packaged food\\nand beverage companies are less likely to have direct relationships with agricultural producers, and\\nhave more ability to influence the water management practices of their manufacturing suppliers.\\nFor specific point allotments by industry, see Exhibit A.1. \\nWater Management Category\\nIndustries\\npackaged Food & Beverage Meat & Agricultural products\\nGovernance & Management 25% 25%\\ndirect Operations 30% 30%\\nManufacturing Supply Chain 20% 15%\\nAgricultural Supply Chain 25% 30%\\nExhibit A.1: Point Allotments by Industry\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Appendix A 59\\nGOvERnAnCE & MAnAGEMEnT\\npackaged\\nFood &\\nBeverage\\nMeat &\\nAgricultural\\nproducts\\nIndicator Scoring Guidance points\\n1: Charges board members and senior executives with oversight of water-related issues\\n1.1 Board Oversight\\nBoard committee has oversight over water-related issues (3 points),\\nAND/OR is regularly briefed by management on water-related issues\\n(3 points)\\nCompany\\u2019s board committee has a charter that references\\n\\u201cwater,\\u201d \\u201csustainability\\u201d or \\u201cenvironment.\\u201d\\n\\u201cRegularly briefed\\u201d means that the board is briefed by\\nmanagement on water issues at least once a year.\\n6 6\\n1.2 Senior Executive Oversight\\nThe individual with the highest level of direct responsibility for\\nwater-related issues reports directly to a member of the Executive\\nManagement Committee (3 points), OR the individual with the\\nhighest level of direct responsibility for water-related issues reports\\nto the CEO (6 points)\\n6 6\\n1.3 Executive Compensation\\nWater is linked to pay or incentive compensation for senior executives\\nWater is linked to pay (typically, bonus compensation) for senior\\nexecutives such as CEO, CFO, Chief Sustainability Officer, SVP\\nof Supply Chain.

One such tool, the Water Risk Filter2 developed by WWF\\nand DEG, tracks water risk exposure in the production of 120 crops and provides a Water Risk Score\\nfor each. Each score is specific to crop and production location.\\nTo illustrate the water risk inherent in the production end of agricultural supply chains, Water Risk\\nFilter data was requested for the top ten agricultural commodities most commonly sourced3 by the\\n37 companies examined in this report. These commodities were: almonds, cocoa, coffee, corn, grapes,\\npalm oil, soybean, sugarcane, tomatoes and wheat.4\\nThe physical water risk scores associated with each of these ten crops in the countries and river\\nbasins where they are produced are provided here. The Water Risk Filter calculates a physical water\\nrisk score using a weighted index of quantitative indicators related to water scarcity and groundwater\\ndepletion, water pollution, drought frequency and threats to biodiversity, among others.5, 6\\nCrop water risk is a function of regional water conditions and the physical water requirements and\\npollution impacts of the specific crop. Exhibit C.1 offers a global snapshot of how physical water risk\\nvaried on average among top crop-producing countries. Almonds, grapes, and tomatoes garnered\\n\\u201csome\\u201d to \\u201chigh\\u201d physical water risk in all four countries responsible for the majority of their production.\\nSugarcane and wheat production in India also garnered risk scores of 4 (\\u201chigh risk\\u201d) or greater.\\n*Production volumes reflect 5-year\\naverage production data (2007-\\n2011) provided by the UN\\u2019s Food\\nand Agricultural Organization (FAO)\\n**1: No or very limited risk, \\n2: limited risk, 3: some risk, \\n4: high risk, 5: very high risk\\n***Trends in global almond\\nproduction have shifted since this\\ndata was collected. According to FAO,\\nin 2013, Australia was the second\\nhighest producer of almonds,\\naccounting for 5.5% of global\\nproduction compared to an average\\n1.3% from 2007 to 2011. Conversely,\\nalmond production in Spain fell from\\nan average 10.2% to 5.1% by 2013.\\nIran and Italy currently rank fifth and\\neighth in global production volume\\nat 3.0% and 2.5%, respectively.\\nExhibit C.1: Water Risk Scores by Crop & Growing Region\\nExposure to physical water risk in agricultural production should also be assessed at the river\\nbasin level. Individual river basins, both within a given country and trans-boundary, contend with\\nvarying ecosystem threats and water uses that affect the physical water risk associated with crop\\nproduction. Physical water risks can also vary within river basins: downstream water availability and\\nquality depend in part on upstream water use, for example. However, gauging the overall water risk\\nof crop production in a given basin can be a useful start to addressing risk exposure and management\\nin agricultural supply chains.\\nNearly 20 percent in the 311 river basins captured in the Water Risk Filter analysis of our crops of\\ninterest were production locations with high physical water risk scores (4 or higher). These river\\nbasins were located across six continents and included production of all ten of our crops of interest.\\nEight of these 59 basins were production sites for five or more high-risk crops (Exhibit C.2).\\nAll but two of these basins were trans-boundary.\\nCrops with physical risk scores exceeding 4.5, indicating the highest level of risk, were produced\\nin just eight river basins (Exhibit C.3). These crops included wheat, tomatoes, grapes, cocoa,\\ncorn and soybeans. The Yongding, Bravo and Chelif river basins were associated with production \\nof several highest-risk crops, with tomato production captured in all three basins. The highest-risk\\nproduction of cocoa was concentrated in Peru\\u2019s Oco\\u00f1a, Majes and Santa River Basins.\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Appendix C66\\nBasin Country Crop physical Water Risk Score\\nyongding China\\nWheat 4.793\\nTomatoes 4.629\\nCorn 4.565\\nSoybean 4.553\\nBravo\\nMexico, \\nUnited States\\nTomatoes 4.768\\nGrapes 4.746\\nChelif Algeria\\nTomatoes 4.524\\nGrapes 4.502\\nOco\\u00f1a peru Cocoa 4.614\\nMajes peru Cocoa 4.550\\nSanta peru Cocoa 4.550\\nLuan China Wheat 4.508\\nChira Ecuador, peru Tomatoes 4.501\\nBasin Country\\nnumber of\\nHigh Risk\\nCrops\\nChira Ecuador, peru 7\\nBravo Mexico, United States 6\\nSan Joaquin United States (CA) 5\\nSalinas United States (CA) 5\\nyongding China 5\\nGuadiana portugal, Spain 5\\nLimpopo\\nSouth Africa,\\nBotswana, Zimbabwe,\\nMozambique\\n5\\nLimari Chile 5\\nExhibit C.2: River Basins with \\nFive or More High Risk* Crops\\nExhibit C.3: The Highest Risk Crops were \\nProduced in 8 River Basins\\n*Indicates a physical water risk score greater than 4\\non a 1-5 scale.\\nAdditional Resources\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Appendix D 67\\nAppEndIx d\\nOrganization Tool or Resource Website\\nAlliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) AWS Certification Standard www.allianceforwaterstewardship.org\\nBloomberg BMAP Water Stress Overlay Bloomberg Terminal\\nCDP CDP Water Information Request www.cdp.net/water\\nCEO Water Mandate CEO Water Mandate Corporate Disclosure Guidelines www.ceowatermandate.org/disclosure\\nCeres Ceres Aqua Gauge Water Risk Management Tool www.ceres.org/aquagauge\\nCeres SEC Climate & Water Disclosure Search Tool http://www.ceres.org/resources/tools/sec-climate-disclosure\\nCeres An Investor Handbook on Water Risk Integration www.ceres.org/investorwaterhandbook\\nGEMI GEMI Local Water Tool http://www.gemi.org/localwatertool\\nMaplecroft Maplecroft Global Water Security Risk Index www.maplecroft.com/about/news/water-security.html\\nNational Integrated Drought \\nInformation System U.S. Drought Monitor www.drought.gov\\nTrucost Water Risk Monetizer www.waterriskmonetizer.com\\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) EPA Toxics Release Inventory Program www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program\\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online echo.epa.gov\\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Nitrogen and Phosphorus Pollution Data Access Tool www2.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/nitrogen-and-phosphorus-pollution-data-access-tool\\nWater Footprint Network Water Footprint Network\\u2019s Assessment Tool waterfootprint.org/en/resources/interactive-tools/water-footprint-assessment-tool\\nWater Footprint Network WaterStat (water footprint statistics) waterfootprint.org/en/resources/water-footprint-statistics\\nWorld Business Council \\nfor Sustainable Development Global Water Tool www.wbcsd.org\\nWorld Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas www.wri.org/aqueduct\\nWorldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter waterriskfilter.panda.org\\nWater Risk Tools & datasets\\nAgriculture-Related Tools & datasets\\nOrganization Tool or Resource Website\\nCeres Climate & Water Risks Facing U.S. Corn Production www.ceres.org/cornmaps\\nField to Market: \\nThe Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture Fieldprint Calculator www.fieldtomarket.org/fieldprint-calculator\\nInnovation Center for U.S. Dairy Farm Smart Tool sites.usdairy.com/farmsmart/Pages/Home.aspx\\nThe Stewardship Index for Specialty Crops Specialty Crop Sustainability Metrics www.stewardshipindex.org\\nSustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI)\\nPlatform SAI Platform www.saiplatform.org\\nU.S. Department of Agriculture Farm & Ranch Irrigation Survey www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Online_Resources/Farm_and_Ranch_Irrigation_Survey\\nUN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) FAOSTAT & AQUASTAT faostat3.fao.org &www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm\\nFeeding Ourselves Thirsty: How the Food Sector is Managing Global Water Risks Endnotes68\\nExecutive Summary\\n1      \\u201cGlobal Risks 2015 10th Edition,\\u201d\\u00a0World Economic Forum, page 20, World Economic\\nForum, Geneva, 2015,\\nhttp://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risks_2015_Report15.pdf\\n2      World Resources Institute, WRI Aqueduct, \\u201cAgricultural Exposure to Water Stress,\\u201d\\nhttp://www.wri.org/applications/maps/agriculturemap/#x=0.00&y=-\\n0.00&l=2&v=home&d=gmia\\n3      Elmquist, Sonja, \\u201cCargill Earnings Decline on Effects of Rail and Drought,\\u201d Bloomberg\\nBusiness, 7 August, 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-07/cargill-\\nearnings-decline-on-effects-of-drought-railcar-shortage\\n4      Giammona, Craig. \\u201cCampbell Soup Struggles With Role as Carrot Farmer Amid Drought.\\u201d\\nBloomberg Business.

Compared to scarcity, water stress is a more\\ninclusive and broader concept. It considers several physical aspects related to water\\nresources, including water availability, water quality, and the accessibility of water (i.e.,\\nwhether people are able to make use of physically available water supplies), which is often a\\nfunction of the sufficiency of infrastructure and the affordability of water, among other things.\\nBoth water consumption and water withdrawals provide useful information that offers insight\\ninto relative water stress. There are a variety of physical pressures related to water, such as\\nflooding and drought, that are not included in the notion of water stress. Water stress has\\nsubjective elements and is assessed differently depending on societal values. For example,\\nsocieties may have different thresholds for what constitutes sufficiently clean drinking water\\nor the appropriate level of environmental water requirements to be afforded to freshwater\\necosystems, and thus assess stress differently.\\u201d\\n5      UN-Water, Coping with Water Scarcity-A Strategic Issue and Priority for System-Wide Action,\\nAugust 2006,\\nhttp://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/2006_unwater_coping_with_water_scarcity_eng.pdf\\n6      Wada, Beek, Bierkens, \\u201cNonsustainable Groundwater Sustaining Irrigation: A Global\\nAssessment,\\u201d Water Resources Research, Vol. 48, January, 25, 2012,\\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011WR010562/pdf\\n7      FAO Aquastat, Water Withdrawal by World Sector, Around 2006, last updated 2015,\\nhttp://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_use/index.stm\\n8      Water Footprint Product Gallery, Water footprint Network,\\nhttp://www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/productgallery\\n9      Information Office of the State Council, People\\u2019s Republic of China, \\u201c1st National Census \\non Pollution Sources Completed,\\u201d 2 Feb. 2010, http://www.china.org.cn/china/2010-\\n02/09/content_19394384.htm\\n10    Jonathan Ansfield and Keith Bradsher, \\u201cChina Report Shows More Pollution in Waterways, \\u201c\\nNew York Times, 9 Feb. 2010,\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/world/asia/10pollute.html\\n11    Elmquist, Sonja, \\u201cCargill Earnings Decline on Effects of Rail and Drought,\\u201d Bloomberg\\nBusiness, 7 August, 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-07/cargill-\\nearnings-decline-on-effects-of-drought-railcar-shortage\\n12    Giammona, Craig. \\u201cCampbell Soup Struggles With Role as Carrot Farmer Amid Drought.\\u201d\\nBloomberg Business.

IntroductionThe State of Global Islamic Economy Report (SGIE) states that in 2019 the number of the world\\u2019s Muslim community reached around 1.9 billion people, with total spending on halal products reaching USD 2.02 trillion. This fi gure is projected to continue to increase in line with the increasing number of the world\\u2019s Muslim community and is estimated to reach USD 2.4 trillion in 2024. In addition, based on the same report, Indonesia\\u2019s Islamic economic indicators in 2020 managed to rank 4th in the world behind Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Six halal industry clusters were assessed: halal food and beverages, Muslim fashion, halal pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, halal media and recreation, halal tourism and the Islamic economy. Based on these sharia economic indicators, Indonesia\\u2019s economic and sharia position is, on average, in the top 10. Two of them have made it into the top fi ve in the world, namely the halal food and beverage sector and the Muslim fashion or clothing sector.The Indonesian government has determined to make Indonesia the centre of the world\\u2019s sharia economy by 2024. Therefore, the Master Plan for the Indonesian Sharia Economy (MEKSI) was established in 2019, which is a road map for developing the sharia economy, which aims to strengthen the national economy. In 2020, the master plan was revealed to be the Implementation Plan and Work Plan 2020-2024 based on solid coordination between the stakeholders of the National Sharia Economic and Finance Committee (KNEKS) from the government, academia, industry players, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), and the community. The plan consists of 30 strategic programs focusing on developing and strengthening the halal industry, Islamic fi nance and social fi nance, and sharia business and entrepreneurship.Apart from the target to become the centre of the world\\u2019s sharia economy by 2024, the impetus for the development of the halal industry also comes from Law Number 33 of 2014 concerning Halal Product Assurance and Government Regulation Number 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Assurance Sector. This regulation requires that all food and beverage products circulating in Indonesia be certifi ed halal, except for those declared haram by religion. The phasing period of halal certifi cation for food and beverages starts from October 17, 2019, to October 17, 2024. Violation of this regulation may result in food and beverage products not being marketed in Indonesia.Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) face various obstacles in fulfi lling their halal certifi cation obligations. Some of the obstacles commonly faced include low awareness to comply with applicable regulations, lack of knowledge about applicable regulations, lack of human resources, and limited funds to invest and make various improvements required by regulations. On the other hand, the business run by MSMEs has an essential role in supporting the nation\\u2019s economy and providing employment opportunities for the community. Muhammad et al. Halal Studies and Society  Vol x No. X  (2024) : x -x 2for handling critical activities (training for all personnel, use and purchase of materials, production methods, storage of materials and products, transportation of materials and products, washing facilities and product presentation methods) as well as evaluating the implementation of HAS in the form of internal audits and management reviews. Dakara Coffee must develop a simple and easy-to-follow HAS Manual because it will be used as a technical guide for HAS implementation. In addition, Dakara Coffee needs to conduct a business analysis to objectively determine its business development strategy based on internal conditions (strengths and weaknesses) and external conditions (opportunities and challenges).Based on the problems above, the objectives of this research are as follows. First, compiling and implementing the guidelines in the manual for the halal assurance system for MSME and identifying the parts that have not been appropriately implemented. Second, formulate recommendations for improvements that need to be made by MSME so that they can implement the halal assurance system manual in their entirety and are ready to carry out halal certification. Third, formulate a halal certification-based MSME business development strategy using the Analytical Hierarchy Process approach.The scope of this research is to prepare all the requirements Dakara Coffee needs to register its products and business entities through BPJPH to be certified by LPPOM MUI. The scope of documents that must be prepared is the Halal Assurance System Manual (SJH Manual). The manual contains many components and is one of the requirements in the registration process so that business owners get other documents such as a Document Receipt Letter (STTD), a Halal Decree (KH), and finally, a Halal Certificate as proof that the product and the business entity have been certified. The data used are primary data obtained from observations and interviews with the management team and employees of Dakara Coffee.2.  Methodology This research was conducted in September \\u2013 December 2021 at Dakara Coffee. Dakara Coffee is located at Dramaga \\u2013 Laladon New Ring Road Number 9 IPB, Dramaga, Bogor. Data collection methods were carried out through direct observation and interviews with the person in charge and employees at Dakara Coffee to obtain primary data. The primary data in this study include the state of the restaurant, list of ingredients, menu list, restaurant layout, restaurant management structure, types of products, work procedures or procedures, as well as opinions from Dakara Coffee and other respondents regarding business development. The collected data is then used to compile the HAS manual. Business process identification is also conducted to obtain the data needed to prepare the HAS manual. This identification is an activity of observing the activities that take place during the operation of the business. This identification process is divided into production preparation, production process, and post-production.Manual of halal assurance system concerning MUI halal requirements (HAS 23000). The preparation of the HAS manual aims to produce guidelines as outputs needed by business actors to register their products and business entities with BPJPH for halal certification needs. It should be underlined that debriefing and training are needed to compile a manual for the halal assurance system as a basis for processing and collecting data as a whole (training will be held on September 21, 2021).Implementation is done by applying the HAS manual designed for routine business activities at Dakara Coffee. The Based on data from the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises (Kemenkop UKM) in March 2021, the number of MSME actors in Indonesia reached 64.2 million, contributing to the gross domestic product (GDP) of 61.07%. The existence of MSMEs can absorb 97% of the total workforce and can collect up to 60.42% of the total investment in Indonesia. Around 70% of the MSMEs produce food and beverages (Tambunan, 2021).Various mentoring programs for MSMEs are essential to ensure the sustainability of MSMEs\\u2019 businesses in terms of fulfilling halal certification obligations following the time target set in PP No. 39 of 2021. The mentoring program can be in the form of technical guidance to prepare competent human resources and all required documents or permits. To register for halal certification and facilities in the form of funding for the halal certification registration process, which includes the management of NIB (Business Identification Number) at BKPM/Ministry of Investment, processing of the Document Receipt Letter (STTD) from the Halal Product Guarantee Agency (BPJPH) of the Ministry of Religion and registration certification to the Halal Inspection Agency (LPH). Various government agencies and private companies have carried out mentoring programs; their scope is minimal compared to the number of MSMEs that need it. In 2021, BPJPH can only provide certification facilitation for MSMEs as many as 2553 through the Sehati21 Program and 1253 through the self-declared route. In 2022, BPJPH will provide a free halal certification program for 10 million MSME products. Therefore, MSMEs assistance efforts must continue to be improved so that its coverage can meet the needs of MSMEs, especially MSMEs with food and beverage products, whose number is more than 40 million.Dakara Coffee is a coffee shop located at Dramaga-Laladon New Ring Road Number 9 Dramaga, Bogor. It is one of the cafes that offer food and beverage products for its customers. Apart from its location close to the Dramaga IPB Campus and its affordable menu prices, Dakara Coffee provides facilities generally favoured by students or the younger generation, such as free internet access networks, attractive decorations for photo shoots, outdoor facilities, and the availability of working space. Dakara Coffee is interesting to be chosen as a research focus as it is categorised as a small business that serves food and beverages, so it must be ready for halal certification under government targets. In addition, Dakara Coffee serves a very diverse menu which, of course, requires various types of ingredients with different specifications. This evidence creates complexity in collecting supporting documents for the materials required in the halal certification criteria.With the enactment of Law No. 33/2014 and PP No. 39/2021, food and beverage products circulated in Indonesia must be certified halal with a preparation period from October 17, 2019, to October 17, 2024. Food and beverage products that have not been certified halal after October 17, 2024, threatened with sanctions should not be marketed. Thus, Dakara Coffee needs to immediately make preparations for halal certification to meet regulatory requirements and continue to operate.Regarding halal certification, Dakara Coffee owners and employees must understand the applicable certification procedures and criteria and prepare the necessary documents. Therefore, technical guidance is needed to prepare all the requirements for a halal certificate. Referring to the procedures and criteria of HAS 23 000, the Halal Assurance System Manual (SJH) is needed to be prepared. The HAS Manual contains an overview of how to fulfil the HAS 23000 criteria, which includes a halal policy statement, determination of the Halal Management Team, an explanation of written procedures 3Muhammad et al.

Most of these raw materials are stored in refrigerators and freezers to avoid damage to materials more quickly.3.1  Halal Assurance System Manual and Its ImplementationThe Halal Assurance System (HAS) is a system that is designed, applied, and maintained with the function of regulating so that materials, production processes, products, human resources, and procedures can always comply with the criteria in the MUI halal certification requirements (HAS 23000) (LPPOM MUI 2008 ). The Halal Assurance System Manual (SJH Manual) is a written guide compiled for restaurants to fulfilment of the requirements is formed in the form of a written document that will be used as a reference for restaurants in the production process. All activities carried out by Dakara Coffee will refer to the written document of the HAS manual. At the end of implementation, analysis and evaluation will be carried out.2.1 Analytical Hierarchy ProcessThe Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a decision support model describing a complex multi-factor or multi-criteria problem into a hierarchy. Hierarchy is defined as a representation of a complex problem in a multi-level structure. The first level is the goal, followed by factors, criteria, and sub-criteria until the last level is an alternative (Saaty, 1993). Through the hierarchy, a complex problem can be broken down into groups which are then arranged into a hierarchical form so that the problem will appear more structured and systematic.The AHP method is based on three main principles and axioms. The basic principles are as follows (Suryadi and Ramdhani, 1998):1. Decomposition. Through this principle, the structure of a complex problem is divided into parts hierarchically. Goals are defined from general to specific. The structure will be compared at objectives, criteria, and alternative levels in its simplest form. Each alternative set allows it to be divided into more detailed levels, covering other criteria. The top level is a goal consisting of one element.2. Comparative judgments, with this principle, pairwise comparisons of all existing elements will be built to produce a scale of the relative importance of the elements. The assessment produces a rating scale in the form of numbers. If combined, pairwise comparisons in the form of a matrix will produce priority.3. Priority synthesis is performed by multiplying the local priorities of the relevant criteria at the top level and adding them to each element in the level affected by the criteria. The results are combined or known as global priorities, which are then used to weight local priorities from the lowest level according to the criteria.There are three stages in the AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) analysis method. These stages are as follows:1. Create a hierarchical structure from an overall managerial point of view to make a pairwise comparison between the factors that play an essential role in the development of Dakara Coffee\\u2019s business. The hierarchy is arranged based on a literature review.2. Make a pairwise comparison matrix between factors to describe the relative contribution of each element to each goal at the level above. The comparison is determined based on the choice of the decision maker or the management of Dakara Coffe and the parties involved in the food and beverage business. Comparison assesses the importance of an element compared to other elements. A scale of 1 will be used until all qualitative and quantitative criteria are calculated to produce weights and priorities; then, the weighting will be carried out by expert sources using the pairwise comparison method.3. Evaluate logical consistency across all hierarchies. Expert informants\\u2019 opinions were analysed with a consistency ratio with a maximum value of 10 per cent. Shaliha (2017) said the Consistency Ratio is an indicator parameter to see whether pairwise comparisons are consistent; if the CR value is below 10 per cent, then the priority scale can Muhammad et al. Halal Studies and Society  Vol x No. X  (2024) : x -x 4Based on observations of all the facilities used by Dakara Coffee which include material preparation, compounding and cooking facilities, beverage preparation, menu presentation facilities, washing facilities and material warehouses, it can be concluded that the Dakara Coffee facilities have met the SJH criteria because no use of pork-derived materials has been found so that the facility meets the criteria. Washing is done with water and liquid soap, equipped with a halal certificate. The adequacy of the washing results is measured by the loss of odours and the cleanliness of the equipment from residual products and materials.Written procedures for purchasing materials have been developed. This procedure ensures that purchases are made only of the specified materials. Because Dakara Coffee is still in the preparation stage for certification, the purchase reference is a brief ingredient list. If Dakara Coffee has been certified, this ingredient list can be downloaded from the CEROL online system. This list of ingredients will become approved by LPPOM MUI and become a reference for purchasing and cooking. The available materials are the result of observations and research data collection.Internal audit implementation procedures have been developed. This procedure regulates the implementation of internal audits, which are scheduled at least once a year. A checklist for implementing the internal audit has been prepared following Dakara Coffee\\u2019s business activities with 11 HAS criteria. An internal audit was conducted on November 8, 2021. There are several weaknesses in implementing the HAS, namely the presence of materials not equipped with supporting documents for materials that meet the criteria, and there are 2 beverage products that use the name beer. Based on the explanation from the halal management team, all audit findings will be resolved immediately before registering for halal certification.Management review procedures have been developed; these reviews are scheduled at least once a year. The management review was carried out on the same day as the internal audit. This review discussed the internal audit results and planned corrective actions to resolve the weaknesses found.3.2 Essential Factors in Dakara Coffee Business DevelopmentThe final analysis stage in this research is to process the essential factors in Dakara Coffee\\u2019s business development. The results of this study look at the role of the halal assurance system or halal management as an essential factor in the development of the Dakara Coffee business. The AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method is used to determine the weight of each factor to obtain a priority ranking.Main Factor ComparisonThe critical factors in developing the Dakara Coffee business that has been compiled are organisational management, halal management, branding strategy, location, and product innovation. The weighting will be given using the pairwise comparison method between one factor and another to see the level of importance. The weight of each factor can be seen in Table 4.produce halal products composed of the requirements of the MUI halal certificate (HAS 23000) issued by the MUI.Identification is carried out in the preparation of the HAS manual at Dakara Coffee. Identification is the first step in preparing the halal assurance system manual so the guide can follow the cafe situation. This study identifies several requirements for the halal assurance system that Dakara Coffee has not fully implemented. Fulfilment of the requirements that must be met includes 11 criteria, namely halal policy, halal management team, training, materials, products, facilities, critical activities, traceability, handling products that do not meet the criteria, internal audits, and management reviews. After completing the identification, the manual preparation of the halal assurance system can be carried out. Then, the HAS manual was implemented, and improvements were made following the provisions of the guide.Dakara Coffee\\u2019s halal policies are as follows: Dakara Coffee is committed to consistently producing and offering halal and safe products for consumption following the MUI halal certificate (HAS 23000) requirements and Government Regulation No. 28 of 2004 concerning Food Safety for Restaurants and Restaurants. This commitment is achieved by using only materials that meet the criteria, ensuring pig and unclean-free facilities, providing training for all employees and implementing them. The training activity was carried out on September 21, 2021.The owner of Dakara Coffee has appointed the halal management team through a letter of appointment. This team consists of a team leader, employees from the purchasing and receiving of materials, the cooking section, the compounding and serving section, and the washing section. The entire halal management team is a permanent team member of Dakara Coffee. Each team member\\u2019s duties in implementing HAS have also been described and linked to daily tasks.Implementation of internal and external training has been prepared. Internal training is scheduled at least once a year, while external training is at least once every two years. The material from the training was about halal regulations, and the 11 HAS criteria. Internal and external training will be held on September 21, 2021, and evidence of implementation is available as a training certificate.All ingredients used in Dakara Coffee have been identified, and supporting documents have been collected. So far, Dakara Coffee has not asked suppliers for supporting material documents. The collection of supporting documents is done by searching the LPPOM MUI website (www.halalmui.org). Based on this search, halal certificate documents were obtained from most of the ingredients used by Dakara Coffee. The search was also carried out by looking at the list of non-critical materials (positive list) published by LPPOM MUI. Non-critical materials are materials that have been verified as halal sources.After identifying the ingredients used by Dakara Coffee and tracing the supporting documents, it was found that several food ingredients were not equipped with documents and the suppliers were also unable to provide information on the ingredients used, namely meatballs, vermicelli, chicken and beef, dim sum, wet noodles, nuggets, sausage, and processed suki-suki. In beverage products, ingredients are not accompanied by supporting documents, namely boba. It was also found that materials not equipped with a halal certificate did not meet the product criteria for certification, namely King Coffee Beer and Ngoro Coffee Beer. This beverage product is a carbonated (soda) coffee drink. The two products do not meet the requirements to be certified halal because they use the word \\u201cbeer\\u201d, whereas, in the HAS 23000 criteria, all materials to be certified must not contain haram and unclean elements.5Muhammad et al. Halal Studies and Society  Vol x No. X  (2024) : x -x Table 4. Results of pairwise comparisons of product innovation factor groupsFactor Weight Priority CRPrice 0.597 1 0.0002Uniqueness 0.143 3Taste 0.259 2Source: own estimation (2022)In product innovation, respondents chose price as the top priority factor with a weight of 0.597, uniqueness as the second priority with a weight of 0.259, and taste with a weight of 0.143. The CR in this analysis is 0.0002 or below 0.1, indicating that the respondent\\u2019s weighting meets the pairwise comparison requirements. Therefore, the management can implement this priority scale as a basis for product development.3.5 Suggestions for Improvement of HAS ImplementationReferring to the results of the identification and implementation of the HAS manual at Dakara Coffee, several aspects are not following the requirements of the MUI halal certificate (HAS 23000). The discrepancy is found in aspects of supporting documents for materials and product names. Materials used in business processes must be accompanied by supporting documents, especially critical materials such as chicken, beef, and processed derivatives. Because there are materials that are not equipped with supporting documents, it is necessary to hold an audit of producers and suppliers to ensure their halal status. Several supporting and auxiliary materials were also found that already have a halal certificate but are almost entering their expiration date.The names and products used and offered to consumers must be free from haram and unclean elements. Based on the identification carried out, product names come from brands with haram and unclean elements (beer/khamr). Although the product has its consumer scope, in the process, implementation, and application of halal certification, it is not allowed for business actors to sell, distribute, and offer products both in terms of name and ingredients with elements containing haram and unclean substances. Due to this, the researcher proposes several alternatives so that Dakara Coffee can implement the HAS manual properly. These alternatives include changing names and materials used in business processes and recommending materials in the form of a list (list) that has been certified halal by MUI as an option in the Dakara Coffee business process.4. Conclusion and RecommendationThe halal assurance system manual was designed to be a written guide for restaurants on the requirements of the MUI halal certificate (HAS 23000). The manual preparation of the halal assurance system can make it easier for restaurants to meet the requirements set by LPPOM MUI.At the implementation stage, Dakara Coffee has not yet fully implemented a halal assurance system in its business activities. Two of the eleven criteria contained in the manual for the halal assurance system have not been fully met, namely the criteria for materials and products. There are still brands of materials and products that are not following the halal provisions of LPPOM MUI (HAS 23000), where it is forbidden to sell products that contain elements of haram and unclean substances with various scopes, both name, taste, and aroma. This discrepancy motivates Dakara Coffee to have several Table 2. The results of the pairwise comparison of the main factor groupsFactor Weight Priority CROrganisational Management0.128 5 0.097Halal Management 0.167 2Branding Strategy 0.161 3Location 0.389 1Product Innovation 0.155 4Source: Primary Data 2022Table 2 shows that respondents chose the location factor as the top priority factor with a weight of 0.389. Then the halal management factor was the second priority with a weight of 0.167, followed by the branding strategy factor with a weight of 0.161, product innovation with a weight of 0.155 and finally, the organisational management factor with a weight of 0.128. The Consistency Ratio (CR) is 0.097 or below 0.1, indicating that respondents\\u2019 weighting meets the requirements for pairwise comparisons. Halal management as a second priority shows that the halal assurance system\\u2019s role is essential in developing a better business.3.3 Comparison of Halal Management FactorsSeveral important factors are considered criteria or sub-factors essential to their implementation. Factors in halal management are compiled based on the halal assurance system manual. These factors are menu and materials, commitment, and training and education. The weight of each factor can be seen in Table 5.Table 3. Results of pairwise comparisons of halal management Factor Weight Priority CRMenu and Ingre-dients0.725 1 0.254Commitment 0.200 2Training and Education0.074 3Source: own estimation (2022)In halal management, respondents chose menu and ingredients as the top priority factor with a weight of 0.725, then commitment as the second priority with a weight of 0.200, and finally training and education with a weight of 0.074. The CR in this analysis is 0.254, which indicates that the weighting by the respondents does not meet the pairwise comparison requirements because it is above 0.1. The halal assurance system cannot be seen from one element alone. Each factor or element in the halal assurance system manual is equally essential to decide whether a product is halal or not.3.4 Product Innovation Factor ComparisonProduct innovation is often an essential factor in the development of a business. However, this study only occupies the fourth position of the level of importance or priority factor. However, the essential element in the product innovation factor remains interesting. Factors in product innovation are price, uniqueness, and taste. The weight of each factor can be seen in Table 6.Muhammad et al. Halal Studies and Society  Vol x No. X  (2024) : x -x 6Arief DK. 2021.

In addition to these discrepancies, some materials (including critical materials) have not been accompanied by complete documents, so further audits are needed on the supplier side. This study recommends similar materials accompanied by an MUI halal certificate as an alternative. However, all business decisions fall back on the team and owners of Dakara Coffee.The main priority factors generated through AHP analysis in the development of Dakara Coffee\\u2019s business are location as the top priority factor, followed by halal management, branding strategy, product innovation, and organisational management. Halal management as a second priority shows that the halal assurance system\\u2019s role is essential in developing a better business. There is also a priority scale of essential elements in several factors. In halal management, the importance of each factor sequentially is menu and ingredients, commitment, and training and education. However, the consistency ratio value in halal management does not meet the requirements, so no absolute conclusions can be drawn. In product innovation, the importance of each factor sequentially is price, uniqueness, and taste.This study suggests that MSMEs, including Dakara Coffee, should immediately make improvements to the criteria that have not been fully met with the proposals and recommendations that have been made so that the manual for the halal assurance system can be fully complied with and can immediately enter the halal certification stage. Applying the official regulations and protecting the consumer against the halal status of the products consumed is essential. It is suggested that business actors, especially the owners and the halal management team of Dakara Coffee, can fulfil their responsibilities in the scope of business activities at Dakara Coffee and as suppliers of raw materials.5.

The college\\u2019s enrolment andinduction procedures were inspected at the beginning of the autumn term1995, specialist subject areas in March, April and May 1995, and aspectsof cross-college provision from 9 to 12 October 1995.  Ten inspectors spenta total of 53 days in the college.  They observed 101 classes involving 1,167students, examined representative samples of students\\u2019 work, and helddiscussions with governors, college staff, students, local employers, arepresentative of the Birmingham Training and Enterprise Council (TEC),parents, teachers from local schools and representatives of the localcommunity.  THE COLLEGE AND ITS AIMS2 Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies is aspecialist provider of education, training and services to the hospitality andrelated service industries.  The college, whose origins can be traced back tothe late nineteenth century, serves local, regional, national and internationalcommunities.  It has occupied its present site in the centre of Birminghamsince 1967 and this central location enables thousands of members of thegeneral public to use its shops, restaurants and other client services eachyear, providing students with a broad range of experience.  The hospitalityindustry is an international one and the college reflects this in its dealingswith industry, students, other education providers and the public.3 There are seven other further education colleges and four sixth formcolleges within the Birmingham conurbation and at least 15 furthereducation colleges within reasonable travelling distance of the city centre.The college has few local competitors in its further education hospitalitywork and although many other West Midlands colleges compete with it fortourism, caring, hairdressing and beauty therapy students, it has increasedits student numbers each year since the mid-1980s.  In recent years therehas been a particularly marked increase in higher education enrolments,especially in tourism and leisure.  The college has the highest proportionof higher education students of any further education college in Englandand Wales and receives more than 65 per cent of its funding from sourcesother than the Further Education Funding Council (FEFC).  It offers a rangeof courses that enables students to progress from foundation topostgraduate level.4 At the time of the inspection, the college had 3,052 FEFC-fundedenrolments, of which 1,757 were full time.  Forty-nine per cent of thestudents were over 19 years of age.  FEFC-funded enrolments by age, bylevel of study and by mode of attendance and curriculum area are shownin figures 1, 2 and 3, respectively.  The college also had 2,303 studentsenrolled on full-time higher education programmes.  There were 320 full-time equivalent staff, of whom 169 were teachers.  A staff profile, withstaff expressed as full-time equivalents, is shown in figure 4.25 The college\\u2019s mission is \\u2018to create an environment in which all clientscan develop appropriate skills, knowledge and quality standards to enablethem to compete, with advantage, at any level within the sectors we serve\\u2019.The college is committed to maintaining its mix of further and highereducation provision which provides clear pathways for students\\u2019progression from the age of 16 onwards.  Priorities include working closelywith schools, employers, TECs and other agencies to identify the needs ofstudents and communities, and providing development opportunities,including access to the latest learning resources, such as computer-basedlearning and the Internet.RESPONSIVENESS AND RANGE OF PROVISION6 Staff are knowledgeable about further education issues.  The college\\u2019smission statement and strategic objectives have been widely and wellcommunicated.  The college is committed to the national targets foreducation and training.  Its programmes include National VocationalQualifications (NVQs), General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs)and higher national certificates.  There is a wide range of courses inhospitality and catering, for which the college is a recognised centre ofexcellence.  There is also a good range of tourism, leisure, hairdressingand beauty therapy courses and, in recent years, there has been anexpansion of health and care courses.  Students have access to a widevariety of enrichment programmes including certification in first aid, theWines and Spirits Education Trust and several other subsidiary awards.7 A key feature of the college\\u2019s strategic plan is the provision of routesfor students to progress from further to higher education.  The college hasa long history of developing and teaching degree level programmes, mostrecently under an accreditation agreement with the University ofBirmingham.  There are also strong links with De Montfort University andthe University of Central England.  Many of the college\\u2019s further educationand higher national certificate programmes are internally validatedthrough an arrangement with the Business and Technology EducationCouncil (BTEC).  The college has established links with higher educationinstitutions in Europe and the Far East.8 The college has an effective marketing strategy which is regularlyreviewed by senior management.  The range of marketing activitiesorganised by the college caters well for the local, regional and internationaldimensions of its course provision.  College publicity and advertisingmaterials include videos and an interactive screen prospectus which isavailable in the reception area.  The marketing manager and two assistantswork with a graphic designer to produce well-designed prospectuses andcourse booklets.  Internal and external market research has enabled thecollege to develop effective strategies for its different markets.  The collegemakes good use of the TEC\\u2019s labour market analysis and informationprovided by the Birmingham economic development unit.  39 The links with local schools are well developed and form a key elementof college marketing.  The college is involved in the compact arrangementsacross the city and is keen to assist with curriculum development.  Thishas included specialist support for a local hospital school for emotionallydamaged pupils as well as direct support for events in schools, for example,in running an international week.  The college organises a range of opendays and taster events and provides places for pupils to undertake workexperience.  Corporation members and college staff regularly supportcollege marketing and public relations activities, such as the students\\u2019entry in the catering and hospitality show \\u2018live kitchen\\u2019 class and the Toqued\\u2019Or Nestl\\u00e9 food service award.  10 The college has secured substantial funding and sponsorship from arange of different organisations.  These include Bass Taverns, who haverecently refurbished a college restaurant to a very high standard, andNestl\\u00e9, who have sponsored the coffee shop.  A major wholesaler wasinvolved in supporting the development of the college\\u2019s internationalrestaurant.  The college has obtained funding from the European SocialFund for a skills development programme in tourism training.  Europeanfunding from Horizon, Leonardo and ADAPT has helped students toundertake educational visits and work experience in several countries.Work with agencies and employers has involved students in tourismprojects both locally, with the Birmingham Jewellery Quarter, andinternationally, with Jersey European Airways.  11 Long-standing working relationships are maintained with industrialgroups and employers and the college arranges industrial placements foralmost all full-time students. Links with employers are reinforced by long-established advisory panels, in which the local business communityis an enthusiastic participant.  Links with the TEC are primarily of astrategic nature, although TEC flexibility funds have been provided todevelop multi-media facilities for teaching food service theory.  The rangeof cost-recovery work undertaken by the college is varied and includesconsultancy to industry.  Recent projects have included: consultancy for acollege in Malaysia wishing to set up vocational programmes in the areasof tourism and hospitality; the design of a tearoom for the City ofBirmingham Museum; and training courses in catering for licensees forBass Taverns.12 The college has strong links with industry throughout the world.There is an annual exchange programme with the United States of America,the Far East and a wide range of European countries.  Students and staffhave taken part in exchange visits, most recently to China.  Languagetuition at a range of levels is offered to all students, irrespective of whetherit is a prescribed element of their course.  There is also good support inEnglish as a foreign language for the wide range of overseas students whoattend the college.413 Although there is well-structured support material of high quality toenable students to undertake independent study, the college has notdeveloped open and distance learning opportunities.  The provision ofsuch opportunities, together with more flexibility over the times of year atwhich students can enrol on courses and complete their awards, wouldenable the college to cater for a wider clientele than at present.14 A revised equal opportunities policy has recently been approved bythe academic board and is to be submitted to the corporation.  The policyis accompanied by a code of practice and a comprehensive action plan.  Itis well supported by an extensive programme of staff development.  Thecollege has an equal opportunities officer who reports regularly to asubcommittee of the academic board.  There is an annual review of theeffectiveness of the policy and code of practice which identifies the progressachieved and the priorities for action.  Enrolments are monitored by age,ethnicity, and disability.  College publicity material is regularly monitoredby the equal opportunities co-ordinator.  The access to higher educationprogramme has been particularly successful in recruiting students fromminority ethnic groups.GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT15 The college has a highly effective corporation, which provides strongstrategic direction.  There are 16 members.  One of the 10 independentmembers is a trade union leader; the others are drawn from the hospitalityindustry, business and the professions.  There is also a nominee of theBirmingham TEC, a police officer, a pro-vice-chancellor from a localuniversity, a member of the college teaching staff nominated by theacademic board, the president of the college guild of students, and theprincipal.  At the time of the inspection there was one vacancy for anindependent member.  Members of the corporation bring a wealth ofrelevant expertise to the college.  Procedures and criteria for theappointment of new members are currently under discussion.  Thecorporation meets at least termly.  Meetings are well attended andsupported by well-written reports and concise minutes.  Corporationpapers, apart from those dealing with a small number of confidentialitems, are available to members of the public.  The corporation has agreeda governors\\u2019 code of conduct and maintains a register of members\\u2019interests.  A helpful and comprehensive governors\\u2019 handbook has beenissued to all members.  16 The corporation has established an appropriate committee structureand revised terms of reference have been established for all committees.Although there is a remuneration committee, there is a lack of clarity aboutwhere responsibility lies for determining the remuneration of seniorpostholders.  Committee meetings are almost always well attended.  Onlyone committee meeting has been inquorate and effective action was takento address this.  The frequency of audit committee meetings has beenincreased in accordance with recommendations from the FEFC\\u2019s auditors.5Governors are well informed about further education matters in generaland about the key strategic issues to be addressed by the college.  Thechairman and clerk provide able leadership and support.  Governors haveattended training seminars and have conducted an assessment of theirfuture training needs.  They receive regular reports and briefings fromsenior staff.  17 The college\\u2019s 1994-97 strategic plan has well-defined aims andobjectives and clearly-stated strategies for achieving them.  The plan issupported by extensive needs analysis and market research.  It includes anumber of operating statements each with their own short-term aims andobjectives, the methods to be used for achieving these, the staff responsiblefor seeing that they are achieved, the timescales, and the budgets available.The operating statement in the 1995-97 updated plan does not reflect allthe key corporate objectives of the original plan.  The senior managementteam regularly monitors progress on the achievement of the college\\u2019sstrategic aims and operational objectives.  The results of this monitoring,together with adjustments made when targets are not achieved, arereported to the corporation.  Corporation members receive regularinformation on staffing and other non-financial information, such asenrolment, examination results, and destinations but data are providedfor the current year only.  The monitoring of college performance shouldbe strengthened by the production of data showing trends in performancefrom year to year and by the provision of an overall summary evaluation ofannual performance.18 Governors have a clear understanding of the distinction betweentheir responsibilities and those of the principal.  They focus broadly onstrategic matters but are also developing their understanding of theeducational context within which they operate in order to make a betterinformed contribution to the strategic planning process.  The process isco-ordinated by the deputy principal and begins with a review of theachievement of the previous year\\u2019s targets.  Faculty and central servicesplans contribute to the process, and use is made of labour market andother intelligence from a variety of sources.  Corporation members discussthe plan in detail before approving it.  Some programme area plans lacktargets and are not linked closely enough to faculty and college plans.19 The senior management team has formal terms of reference.  Theprincipal is supported by a deputy, two faculty heads, the director of financeand the college secretary.  They work closely as a team and provide strongleadership which is valued by staff.  They pay close attention to matters ofstrategic detail, including legislation, finance and the ethos of the college,and are united in their belief that the quality of provision for studentsshould be the basis for all decision making.  In this they are fully supportedby staff.  The management style of the college enables staff and students tofeel confident about making proposals and taking initiatives.  Agreed actionis effectively implemented by faculty and cross-college teams.  620 The academic board is at the head of an effective network for ensuringthat the principal is fully informed and advised on academic matters.  Itmeets once a term.  Three committees and two faculty boards report to it.The faculty boards co-ordinate the work of a range of programme boards.Within the two college faculties and the central services departments, linesof management and accountability are clear and well understood.  Regularmeetings of faculty and programme boards support the planning andmonitoring of curriculum provision.  A well-received new developmenthas been the staff handbook, which contains key policies and proceduresand is a useful reference document for all staff.  Regular newsletters,weekly diary updates and twice-yearly meetings of all staff contributeeffectively to good communications and a shared sense of purpose withinthe college.  At the level of individual programmes, and especially wherelarge numbers of staff are involved, there is sometimes too much relianceon informal communications.21 College policies are well established and regularly revised.  Theymake clear what the college aims to do about a wide range of issuesincluding health and safety, equal opportunities, personnel, and studentsupport.  Guiding principles, detailed practices, and monitoringarrangements are well documented.  For instance, the health and safetypolicy is supplemented by a manual of procedures and an inventory ofpotentially dangerous equipment which serves as the basis for a weeklyaudit.  College policies are effectively monitored.22 Enrolment targets are set in accordance with faculty priorities agreedby the senior management.  Enrolment targets, retention rates andattendance are closely monitored.  There are useful procedures forobtaining information on students\\u2019 destinations and these are beingdeveloped further.  The college met its growth target in the academic year1994-95 and, at the time of the inspection in October 1995, it was expectingto meet its target for 1995-96.  23 The college\\u2019s income and expenditure for the 12 months to July 1995are shown in figures 5 and 6.  The college\\u2019s average level of funding for1995-96 is \\u00a316.28 per unit.  The median for general further education andtertiary colleges is \\u00a317.84 and the median for all sector colleges is \\u00a318.56per unit.  24 Finance within the college has been controlled centrally but fromSeptember 1995 pay and non-pay expenditure budgets have beendelegated to the appropriate senior managers.  Budgets for pay expenditureare allocated on the basis of an agreed staffing complement for each areaof the college, while those for non-pay expenditure are made on a historicalbasis.  In both cases, adjustments are made for overachievement orunderachievement of target enrolments.  Progress on the development ofunit costing has been cautious.  The procedure for allocations has beenunder review and the college intends, during the current year, to implement7a new system based on the actual unit cost of delivery.  Financial reportsare presented at each meeting of the corporation and to the corporationchair, the finance and general purposes committee and the seniormanagement team at monthly intervals.  The quality of financial reportshas been progressively improved to make them easier to understand andmore useful to managers and corporation members.  The college has builtup a healthy financial position which has enabled it to undertake majorimprovements and developments from its own resources.25 The college has recently installed a new, fully-integratedcomputerised management information system.  Under the previoussystem faculty managers had ready access to information, but theinformation was not fully developed at programme area level.  A newinformation systems policy is in place and there is a clear strategy forimplementation.  The new system is already producing managementinformation.  Data are collected on student enrolments, retention,examinations and students\\u2019 destinations.  Attendance data are collectedby the faculties, but not yet collated at college level.  Teaching divisions arelinked to the system and further cable points are being installed to provideall staff with on-line information tailored to their needs.  Internal electronicmail and connection to the Internet have been included in the new system.  STUDENTS\\u2019 RECRUITMENT, GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT26 The college student services unit and faculties are responsible forstudents\\u2019 recruitment, guidance and support.  Their work is effectivelysupported by the city careers partnership, with which the college has asubstantial service level agreement.  This arrangement ensures thatstudents receive the advice and guidance they need.  The student servicesunit makes provision for personal counselling, careers guidance, studysupport, health care, overseas liaison, accommodation, nursery placesand financial and welfare advice.  It has established links with externalagencies to enhance the services provided.  27 Attendance at more than 50 careers events throughout the cityenables staff and students to act as ambassadors for the college.  Collegestaff also play a full and active part in college open days and evenings,contribute to guided tours of the college and provide taster days for school pupils.  Members of staff make overseas visits to recruit students.  High-quality promotional materials and other documents support theseactivities.  Careers events also take place in city centre sites and coursesare advertised in the local press.  Posters are placed in city libraries andpublic amenity areas.  Students had been made aware of the coursesavailable by the city careers partnership, college publicity and open daysand evenings, employers, relations and friends.  28 The college\\u2019s admission\\u2019s policy ensures that prospective studentsreceive the impartial advice and guidance they need to make well-informedcareer choices.  The procedures for admitting students are set out clearly.8Where appropriate, parents are invited to accompany prospective studentsto admission interviews.  Parents welcome the opportunity to be involved.Interviews are conducted by a team of teachers working to a commonformat.  Further advice and guidance is given at this time.  The range ofprogrammes available in the college provides opportunities for internaltransfers, and some students take advantage of this.  The initial choice ofcourse is checked again during induction and students wishing to transferfrom one course to another or to enter full-time employment are referredto the college or city careers advisers for further guidance.  29 Enrolment is effectively organised.  The procedures used ensure thatstudents continue to receive full and impartial advice.  All aspects ofenrolment are well integrated; students move smoothly from one phase tothe next.  For new students, the process commences with pre-enrolmentactivities in July.  For continuing students, enrolment can take place atany time from late June onwards.  Sufficient opportunities are given forstudents to ask questions and receive the information they need.Enrolment data are recorded electronically and continuously updated sothat up-to-the-minute information can be obtained from the system.  30 Induction is well organised.  All full-time students have one dayallocated for faculty induction and three days for the divisional inductionprogramme.  There is a shorter induction programme for part-timestudents.  Overseas students have a two-week induction programme.Further induction is conducted at the beginning of each course, or module,during the first weeks of teaching.  To support induction, student andfaculty handbooks and the student charter are distributed.  The studenthandbook includes information on programme content and a statementon assessment regulations and appeals procedures.  The faculty handbookcontains key information on fire procedures and college rules andregulations.  Full-time and part-time students report that inductionarrangements are helpful.  During induction, all students, apart from thosebeing admitted to higher national certificate courses, are assessed forbasic literacy and numeracy.  Where additional support is necessary, it isdelivered through timetabled sessions, workshops or attendance at thestudy support centre.  31 The college mentoring system is a strong feature of the arrangementsmade for academic and personal guidance.  Timetabled tutorials enablementors to give high-quality pastoral and academic support to students.  Ahandbook for mentors has been produced to ensure that this is conducteduniformly across the college.  A detailed careers resource pack for mentorsenhances the delivery of careers education.  Teachers receive staffdevelopment on mentoring to support this aspect of their work.32 A well-used confidential counselling service is provided by a full-timequalified student counsellor.  Appointments can be made through thestudent services unit, although students requiring urgent help are seenimmediately.  The counselling service offered is well managed and operates9effectively.  The service is appropriately located and accessible to students.Health care is provided by a qualified nurse.  Clear aims and objectiveshave been set to govern the service provided.  The nurse works closelywith the student counsellor and is a member of the college\\u2019s health andsafety committee.33 There are effective arrangements to support overseas students.During their induction period they are allocated accommodation in thecollege\\u2019s halls of residence.  The accommodation officer maintains anextensive list of private sector accommodation, which has been vetted bycollege staff.  Overseas students may obtain assistance on any aspect ofstudent life from the overseas students\\u2019 liaison officer.  34 The college has a policy and procedures for accrediting students\\u2019prior achievement.  However, the college\\u2019s alternative and preferredapproach is to use fast-tracking procedures to exempt from relevant unitsthe students who demonstrate that they have the necessary competence.This approach is quicker than gathering a portfolio of evidence and hasbeen particularly useful for students transferring from a course at anothercollege.  The college has conducted a research project with the Hotel andCatering Training Company to examine the possibilities for theaccreditation of prior learning in the hospitality sector.  The potential forthis method of accreditation has not yet been fully realised.35 The college asks school leavers to bring their national records ofachievement to the admission interview.  Not all do so.  It is not collegepractice to issue or to systematically maintain the national records ofachievement.  The college position is that course portfolios of students\\u2019work provide sufficient evidence of their achievements.36 The study support centre provides learning support for studentsidentified through diagnostic screening as needing additional help withliteracy, numeracy and information technology, as well as for thoserequiring general help with their studies.  To ensure that studentsdiagnosed as requiring support attend the centre, links have beenestablished between the centre and mentors who are responsible formonitoring students\\u2019 attendance and performance.  A daily usage recordis maintained which enables the manager to monitor attendance and filesamples of students\\u2019 work in order to monitor their progress.  Mentorsreceive formal notes informing them of students\\u2019 attendance and progress.The modern languages division conducts individual interviews withstudents to help place them in a class at the appropriate level.  The divisionhas a clearly-understood system of referral for students who fail to reachthe required standard in their assignments.  Some students receive goodsupport through the language workshop.  However, take-up for this is lowand students should be encouraged to make more use of the provision.  37 High-quality careers advice and guidance are provided by mentorsand the college careers adviser, in conjunction with the city careerspartnership.  Careers surgeries are conducted throughout the year to10ensure that students are following the right course, can make well-informed career choices and gain suitable employment on the successfulcompletion of their course.  Careers resources are conveniently locatedand sufficient careers literature is provided.  The absence of computerisedcareers databases is a weakness; the college is addressing this issue.Employers are invited to the college to recruit students who are nearingthe end of their course.  An annual careers event provides students withan opportunity to meet a wide range of employers.  The Department forEducation and Employment\\u2019s employment service operates a job shopthroughout the year for students requiring more information about workopportunities.  Some students had been unable to visit this because theirtimetables did not permit it.  Part-time and full-time jobs are also advertisedon strategically-placed notice boards throughout the college.  38 The college provides a range of additional resources to assist students,including specialist facilities for students with hearing or visualimpairment.  To enable students with young children to enter courses, thecollege has a well-resourced 50-place nursery, which it shares with thelocal community.  The college has an access fund and two hardship fundsand, where necessary, gives generous support to students for travelexpenses and for purchasing specialist equipment required for vocationalcourses.  39 The students\\u2019 guild provides representation, welfare information andsocial and sporting activities.  It caters for all students.  The guild has afull-time president, who is a member of the corporation and the academicboard.  The guild\\u2019s activities and societies are popular with students.  TEACHING AND THE PROMOTION OF LEARNING40 Of the 101 sessions observed 78 per cent received a grade 1 or 2.  Inonly 4 per cent of sessions did weaknesses clearly outweigh strengths.  Inthe sessions inspected the average attendance level was 76 per cent.  Thefollowing table summarises the grades given for the teaching sessionsinspected.Teaching sessions: inspection grades by programme of studyProgrammes Grade 1 2 3 4 5 TotalsGNVQ 3 9 3 0 0 15NVQ 28 15 3 1 0 47Access to highereducation 1 2 0 0 0 3Higher education 3 4 1 2 0 10Other vocational 6 8 11 1 0 26Total 41 38 18 4 0 1011141 High standards of teaching were achieved in catering, hospitality,and hairdressing and beauty.  Staff were expert in their field.  In all subjectsthe curriculum was well planned and carefully constructed to providestudents with opportunities to develop practical skills.  Much teaching tookplace in realistic working environments.  There are long-standingarrangements for work experience which include codes of conduct forstudents and a well-managed assessment and reporting mechanism.  Morethan 1,760 students each year undertake periods of work experienceranging from three weeks to one year.  42 Catering and food service sessions were well planned andexceptionally well taught.  Courses were appropriate for the studentsrecruited and their intended careers.  Schemes of work were well developedand met the requirements of awarding bodies.  NVQ sessions had a goodbalance of tuition in basic practical skills and underpinning theoreticalknowledge.  Teaching in theory classes had clear aims, provided accuraterelevant and up-to-date information, and reinforced practical learning.  Inpractical classes the quality of teaching and learning was exceptionallygood and the standards achieved by the students were high.  Studentsbenefited from the realistic work environments and industrial workingpractices were frequently adopted.  For example, students following thestores module started at 07.00 each morning in the basement where theyworked alongside teachers, receiving and checking provisions.  Studentsbeing taught in the college restaurants dealt with a wide variety ofcustomers, had opportunities to develop their social skills, and learned towork under pressure.  Staff showed high levels of professional skill andprovided good role models.43 Teachers in hospitality administration were enthusiastic,knowledgeable and caring.  They provided effective support for adultsreturning to college, building their confidence and developing their studyskills.  When students fell behind with their work, they received friendlybut firm guidance.  Much classroom activity was directly related tovocational work.  In some classes there was good use of learning aids tostimulate interest and to minimise the time students spent taking notes.There were regular tutorials to review progress and provide support.However, in more than a quarter of the classes seen attendance wasapproximately 50 per cent.44 Classes in leisure and tourism were often stimulating and challenging;there was a good balance of input from tutors and activities which involvedstudents working alone or in groups.  Techniques to involve students, forexample the use of questionnaires to create discussion points duringclasses, were well developed.  The majority of teaching was well organisedand effective.  In some less effective teaching sessions tutors displayedlimited presentational skills.45 Standards of teaching were high in hairdressing and beauty.  Theteaching of practical work was particularly expert.  The salons provided a12highly realistic work environment in which there was always a professionalatmosphere.  The curriculum was well planned and organised so thatstudents worked with a wide range of clients and treatments.  However,courses did not include sufficient opportunities for students to developcore skills in information technology.  Attendance on some courses was amatter for concern.  46 In health and care, many classes included practical activities whichdeveloped students\\u2019 skills and confidence and helped them to practiseusing the equipment and materials to be found in their work placements.Tutors were knowledgeable and had relevant experience in social services.Students responded well to group activities.  In some of the better sessionsthey were encouraged to undertake independent research on the topic.Tutors frequently used questions to draw out and build on students\\u2019experience.  In some weaker sessions, they spent too long asking simplefactual questions on familiar topics.  Some students contributed little orallyand made only moderate progress with individual tasks.  Students\\u2019 use ofinformation technology on these programmes was limited.47 Schemes of work in foreign languages had a clear vocational focuswhich helped students to become familiar with the language related totheir main programmes of study.  Students were able to practise the fullrange of language skills in class.  There were examples of lively sessionswhere they confidently used the foreign language in response to teachers\\u2019questions and in role-play.  Some effective use was made of the languagelaboratory and audio-visual aids.  Teachers were fluent in the languagesthey taught.  However, in a significant number of classes there was toomuch use of English.  Learning was supported by good-quality handoutsbut these were sometimes overused.  In some sessions too little wasexpected of students.  There was little checking by teachers of whatstudents had learned and records of students\\u2019 progress were inadequate.The attendance level in some classes was low.48 In most programme areas the assessment and recording of students\\u2019progress was thorough.  The assessment of practical work was carefullyplanned.  Tutors explained assessment tasks and there were oftenopportunities for students to progress at speeds suited to their needs andabilities.  Assessments were challenging and took a variety of forms.Systems for monitoring students\\u2019 work and progress on NVQs were welldeveloped.  The marking of students\\u2019 assignments was usuallyaccompanied by clear guidelines on how they could improve the quality oftheir work.STUDENTS\\u2019 ACHIEVEMENTS49 Students are well motivated and enjoy their studies.  They speakhighly of the college, its staff and facilities.  The many customers andclients of the college\\u2019s restaurants, salons and shops provide theopportunity for students to display well-developed social and practicalskills.  Students are proud of the college\\u2019s reputation, eager to be part of itand to add to it.  1350 Students develop knowledge and understanding through a wide rangeof activity in both theory and practical classes.  This includes: a thoroughknowledge of food theory and science; an understanding of managementissues in hospitality management; good background knowledge in traveland tourism; and good technical knowledge in hairdressing and beauty.Their ability to apply this knowledge and understanding is clearlydemonstrated through assessed work leading to a range of qualifications.51 In all curriculum areas students learn to carry out practical worksafely and with high levels of competence.  High professional standards aredeveloped through the provision of realistic work environments inside thecollege and through the use of outside placements.  Excellent levels ofachievement in catering and bakery reflect the high professional calibre ofstaff and the standard of equipment in the college restaurants and kitchens.Hairdressing and beauty students acquire professional and social skills byworking in well-equipped salons which have a continuous flow of customers.Students studying health and care benefit from a well-planned placementprogramme.  In travel and tourism, and in language learning, the acquisitionof skills through the practical provision in the college is less strong.52 Students regularly achieve success in regional and nationalcompetitions and take part in joint ventures with the National ExhibitionCentre and other agencies and employers.  In the recent past, collegestudents have been regional and national finalists in a number ofprestigious competitions.  They have twice won the Moet Champagnechallenge and achieved third place in the National Indian Cookerycompetition.  The college has twice been designated Craft College of theYear (catering).  Students from the division of travel and tourism won theAmerican Express student of the year in 1992 and the American Expressbest achiever award in 1993.  Such activities enhance students\\u2019experiences and career prospects, and strengthen the college\\u2019s reputationas a centre of excellence.53 Students\\u2019 core skills are particularly well developed throughintegrated work.  Students\\u2019 written and oral work demonstrate thatappropriate levels are attained in communication.  Numeracy isdemonstrated through a range of activities requiring a knowledge ofquantity and the application of calculation skills.  Information technologyskills are used in data and spreadsheet creation and the use of specialistcomputerised systems is built into a number of programmes.  Somestudents, however, do not acquire appropriate wordprocessing skills inthe initial stages of their courses.  54 Students on NVQ and GNVQ courses have high levels of achievement.Ninety-four per cent of the 162 students aged 16-18 were successful intheir final year of study on the vocational courses included in 1994performance tables produced by the Department for Education (now theDepartment for Education and Employment).  This places the college14among the top third of colleges in the further education sector using thisperformance measure.  At NVQ level 1, 92 per cent of students aged 16-18and 78 per cent of students aged 19 years and over gained the award.  AtNVQ level 2, the respective figures were 86 per cent and 82 per cent and,at NVQ level 3, 100 per cent and 78 per cent.  There was a 100 per centpass rate at GNVQ intermediate level.  Pass rates in GNVQ external testswere high.  Performance in programmes giving NVQ equivalence fromlevels 1 to 4 ranged from 67 to 100 per cent.55 In  1994-95, the overall college pass rate for NVQ levels 1 and 2 was88 per cent and for NVQ level 3, 92 per cent.  Many students also achievedadditional specialist certificates in food, beverage, hygiene and health-related subjects.  One hundred and seven students were enteredfor the English Speaking Board examinations and 95 per cent passed.  In1994, 60 students enrolled on access courses for entry to higher education;46 per cent successfully completed the course and the majority of theremainder achieved some unit credits.56 In catering and in hospitality administration, examination resultswere especially good.  In 1994, no subject area had pass rates below 83per cent and there was a 100 per cent pass rate in some areas of work.Results in hairdressing and beauty were good; in 1994 there was a 100per cent pass rate in foundation certificate and national diplomaprogrammes.  The introduction of the Confederation of InternationalBeauty Therapy and Cosmetology programme in beauty therapy at NVQlevel 3 was particularly successful: 19 of the 20 students originally enrolledachieved the award.  Success rates for nursery nursing varied between 68and 70 per cent; BTEC social care achieved 95 per cent.  Large numbers ofstudents achieve accreditation at one of five levels in one or more modernlanguages; the majority of students achieve at least modest levels oflanguage competence.57 Full-time students have a good record of progress to further and highereducation and employment.  The table below shows students\\u2019 destinationsas a percentage of full-time students leaving the college in 1994.Higher Further Level education education Employment OtherFoundation/NVQ level 1 0 93 5 2Intermediate/NVQ level 2 7 18 70 5Advanced/NVQ level 3 25 7 63 5NVQ level 4 59 0 34 715In 1994, 39 students progressed from the national diploma in travel andtourism to higher national diploma and BA honours programmes in leisureand tourism management.  In the same year, 20 national diploma studentsin hospitality and catering progressed directly into the second year of thehigher national diploma.  Where students sought direct employment, thequality of the posts obtained was high and closely related to the trainingundertaken at college.  Part-time students, who were usually alreadyemployed, often used their training to further their careers.58 In 1994-95, just over 87 per cent of students completed theirprogrammes.  This is slightly below the regional and national average forsector colleges which is just under 90 per cent.  In a small number ofcourses more than 20 per cent of students withdrew in the first year.However, withdrawal is monitored through the college mentor system andstudents who withdraw often enter other courses or take up employment.QUALITY ASSURANCE59 The college has a commitment to quality assurance and to theimprovement of quality which covers all programmes and support services.The quality policy has been agreed by the academic board and is monitoredby its curriculum and quality development subcommittee.  An annualevaluation of quality is produced.  Regular newsletters provide staff withinformation on the implementation of relevant procedures and associatedstaff development.  Faculty boards and programme boards also supportthe development of quality assurance.  The college is committed to attainingthe International Standards Organisation (ISO) 9000 but has not achievedits original target date of May 1994 and estimates that it will require afurther two years to complete the work required.60 Existing procedures for quality assurance are clear and wellimplemented.  A continual quality review procedure has been developedfrom a college system of annual programme review; it will include aplanned schedule of reports at key points throughout the year.  The systemwas piloted towards the end of the last academic year.  Whilst there is acommitment from staff to implement this new approach to reporting, it isin its first year of operation and is, as yet, untested.  61 Effective action is taken in response to feedback from students andfrom internal and external assessors.  The programme boards establishedfor each programme area produce clear minutes of their meetings showingthe actions required and the points which are to be taken to the facultyboard.  Comments made by internal and external assessors are discussedand any necessary action is taken following internal and externalassessment and moderation.  62 An internal audit team of 12 members of staff representing all facultiesand support areas has been recently recruited and trained to carry outinternal quality audits modelled on Council Circular 93/28, AssessingAchievement.  The team conducted audits during the last academic year16and further audits are scheduled to take place through to August 1997.  Inresponse to the audit, the head of the faculty or department produces anaction plan to address any weaknesses identified.  This plan is reviewedby the curriculum and quality development subcommittee.  A summary ofthe strengths and weaknesses found by the audit team is also sent to theprincipal.  Improvements have taken place as a result of this audit process.  63 Staff and students are fully aware of the student charter and, togetherwith corporation members, have participated in its recent review.  Thecharter contains clear targets which underpin the college\\u2019s commitmentsto its students.  Whilst there is evidence of the monitoring of achievementagainst charter targets at programme and faculty operational levels, thereis no overall summary evaluation to give a college-wide perspective ofachievement against the targets set.64 Industrial placements are a significant element in the learningexperience of the students but there is no overall college policy or procedureto ensure agreed standards for the control and quality assurance of suchplacements.65 The college is committed to gaining the Investors in People awardand intends to apply for recognition status in November 1995.  The staff-development policy is well established and has been agreed by theacademic board.  The policy applies to all college staff.  The college investsa considerable percentage of its expenditure in staff development.Priorities are clearly stated in the staff training and development plan andthese are agreed by the academic board.  Progress against priorities ismonitored.  Evaluation includes an analysis of participation andexpenditure against priorities by faculty and department.  It includes anassessment of the quality of the training supplied by providers which isthen used to inform future planning of training.  66 The college introduced a staff-appraisal system in September 1994.There is an intention that all staff will be appraised annually, but thistarget has not been achieved; at the time of the inspection 92 per cent ofstaff had been appraised.  There are procedures designed to promoteconsistency in the implementation of the appraisal policy.  Staff have foundthe appraisal process supportive; it is focused on the identification ofindividual needs for training and development to support improvedperformance.  The continuous improvement of teamwork is also addressedby the allocation of a \\u00a3500 budget to each team to support agreed team-development activities.67 All new staff undertake a period of induction.  Criteria have beendeveloped to assess teaching competence and teaching is observed andassessed against these criteria during the first year of the appointment.Strengths and weaknesses are discussed with the teacher and an actionplan agreed where appropriate.  These procedures apply to all newly-recruited teachers, regardless of their previous teaching experience.171868 The college has produced a self-assessment report which addressesaspects of its operation under the headings of the Council Circular 93/28,Assessing Achievement.  Many of the strengths identified in the reportwere confirmed by the inspection team.  However, there was insufficientanalysis of weaknesses and judgements were not sufficiently linked tosupporting evidence.RESOURCESStaffing69 All college staff, whether teaching or non-teaching, work effectivelyin teams and have equal access to the full range of college procedures,including professional development and appraisal.  70 Teaching staff have a wide range of expertise and are highly qualified.Many staff have previous industrial experience which is substantial and ofhigh quality.  Much experience has been gained in international contexts.Since incorporation, the level of staff turnover has permitted the college torecruit staff with recent industrial experience whilst maintaining a core ofstaff with extensive teaching experience.  Most of those teaching practicalsubjects have advanced qualifications.  Eighty-six per cent of teaching staffhave an initial degree and 39 per cent have a higher degree.  Seventy-fourper cent of teachers have a teaching qualification.  Over 100 staff now holdTraining and Development Lead Body awards.71 Well-qualified support staff play a key role in the work of the college.The college has adopted a policy of deliberately employing a high ratio ofsupport staff so that teaching staff can concentrate on their teaching role.Since 1993, the number and range of support staff has grown significantly.Their deployment has been carefully monitored.  72 The personnel function has recently been reorganised to focus morestrongly on changing employment legislation and industrial relations.Ninety-seven per cent of teaching staff have new employment contracts.Personnel policies and procedures are well documented.  Training eventshave been organised to ensure that staff have information about thecollege\\u2019s approach to matters such as equal opportunities, recruitmentand sickness absence.  73 Forty-six per cent of teaching staff are female.  Whilst there arecurrently no female members of the senior management team, there aremany female middle managers.  Eight per cent of teaching staff are fromnon-white groups.  The proportion of staff from minority ethnic groupshas been increasing; almost 14 per cent of the staff recruited in the past 12months are from these groups.  Equipment/learning resources74 The college is strongly committed to providing the best possibleequipment for staff and students.  There is an effective policy for thereplacement of equipment on a rolling programme.  Major capitalexpenditure proposals are incorporated in the strategic plan.  The collegehas sufficient resources to finance capital expenditure from its own reserves.75 Curriculum areas are equipped to industry standards.  Courses incatering are well supported by the high quality of equipment.  In leisureand tourism the quality of equipment is generally satisfactory, althoughthe travel information centre would benefit from the availability of relevantcomputer software.  In hairdressing and beauty therapy the salons arewell equipped to industrial standards and benefit from the use of an up-to-date compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM) database.  Foreignlanguages teaching is supported by a new 16-position language laboratory,relevant videos and CD-ROMs.  76 The library has recently been refurbished at a cost of \\u00a3250,000.  Itnow shares space with the resource centre and this gives students easyaccess to different forms of learning materials.  The library is a specialistnational centre for hotel and catering and for tourism and leisure courses.Further education students benefit from access to the substantial learningresources available for higher education.  The library is well staffed andhas an adequate budget which has increased substantially in recent years.Catalogues and purchases are computerised.  Book issues have increasedvery rapidly in the last three years.  Helpful library guides are producedfor students and the library is highly responsive to requests for assistance.The environment is attractive and a quiet room is available for privatestudy.  In the main, the bookstock and journals provide good support forthe curriculum areas and there are 12 stand-alone CD-ROM players.Further education students under 19 receive free textbooks and otherstudents receive essential texts on annual loan.  The three library catalogueterminals available to students are insufficient to cope with the demand,although upgrading of this facility is under discussion.77 The college has over 300 personal computers, most of which arerecent models, and 90 machines are available in the resources centre on adrop-in basis.  A useful facility enables students to book equipment up toone week in advance.  The ratio of full-time equivalent students tocomputers is approximately 10:1.  The resource centre has good weekdayopening hours, and is also open at weekends.  There are some usefulintroductory guides to software applications.  Computers are available inother rooms for students to use outside timetabled hours.  There havebeen some recent shortages in technician support; the college has nowadvertised for replacements.  Information technology is well integratedwith the curriculum in most areas and there are some outstandingexamples of its use, notably the Remanco point-of-sale data systems usedin realistic working environments.  Although most students enter thecollege with information technology skills, there is no survey to establishthe levels of skills possessed by further education students; this makes itdifficult to match fully teaching and resources to students\\u2019 requirements.192078 The college information technology users\\u2019 group, which meetsfrequently, plays a major role in advising senior management on futurepolicy and in making specific recommendations for the purchase ofhardware and the development of networks.  The growing importance ofinformation technology for library resources would indicate a need for thelibrary to be represented on this group.  Although the library and resourcecentre are physically integrated, their management is separate.  Accommodation79 The college is housed in purpose-built premises on a prominent sitevery close to the city\\u2019s business centre and major tourist facilities.  Thecollege also rents some teaching and student residential accommodationaway from the main site.  The main building is an 11-storey tower block;teaching and administrative support is housed on the first nine floors andsome student social and residential accommodation on the remaining two.There are four distinctively-designed restaurants, a students\\u2019 refectory,four hairdressing and beauty therapy salons, a tourist information centre,a leisure centre and a bakery and patisserie shop.  Members of the publicwho have used these facilities are warm in their praise of the quality andservice provided.  The reception area is constantly busy and receptionstaff are always welcoming and willing to provide information.  There is a24-hour security service during term time and effective external lighting atnight.  Car parking on this city centre site, even with the addition of someleased spaces in a nearby car park, is very restricted.80 The college has a well-developed accommodation strategy.  A newcampus is being developed on a nearby site within walking distance of themain building.  Work, scheduled for completion in the summer of 1996,has already begun on new residential accommodation for students.  Thenew site is adjacent to a residential campus of the University of Birminghamand this may enable the college to reduce costs, for example, in cabling tobring the Internet to students\\u2019 residences.  Completion of thisaccommodation will release other accommodation on the top three floorsof the main building for conversion to teaching and other uses.  Inhairdressing and beauty therapy, any future growth will require additionalaccommodation.  In catering, some teaching areas are too small or ofinappropriate design for the number of students who occupy them.81 Accommodation is effectively managed.  The quality of rooms isgenerally good and there has been substantial investment in essential worksand a rolling programme of improvements.  Windows have been replacedand new lifts have been installed in the centre of the building.  Muchredecoration has taken place.  The building is clean and tidy and conveys alively, busy ethos.  There are attractive displays in some areas and thesignposting is clear.  Close attention has been paid to energy and waterconservation.  Ventilation of some parts of the building could be improved.Some accommodation is cramped and stuffy.82 The nature of the building has made it difficult to provide easy accessfor those with restricted mobility.  However, there are lifts to all floors,ramps to bridge changes in floor levels, and doorways which have beenwidened to accept wheelchairs.  Special arrangements have been madefor evacuation in case of fire.  The new lifts have been specially designedto cater for those with a range of disabilities.  It is unfortunate that toiletfacilities for students with disabilities are available only on the seventhand ninth floors.  The new hall of residence will have 18 rooms speciallyadapted to the needs of students with disabilities.83 A room-utilisation survey is carried out twice a year and is used as abasis for policy on future allocation.  Most rooms are allocated to thefaculties; the number of centrally-pooled rooms is small.  The flexiblepartitioning on each floor makes changes of use and size relatively easy,for example, the conversion of a former science laboratory into generalteaching accommodation.  Modern languages accommodation has beenrefurbished but the location of rooms on different floors means that theyare not used as effectively as they might be.84 Students resident in the main building have access to their own socialaccommodation.  The students\\u2019 refectory has been refurbished and is alively meeting place.  Other social accommodation for non-residentstudents is restricted to a basement bar in which smoking is allowed.There is no general social accommodation for non-smokers nor any whichis well adapted to the needs of mature students.CONCLUSIONS AND ISSUES85 The major strengths of Birmingham College of Food, Tourism andCreative Studies are:\\u2022 the strong and supportive leadership provided by the corporationand senior management \\u2022 clear lines of management and accountability, supported by goodinternal communications\\u2022 courses that offer substantial opportunities for the development ofskills in realistic work environments\\u2022 strong links with industry in the United Kingdom and overseas\\u2022 highly-qualified and suitably-experienced staff\\u2022 high standards of teaching on most courses\\u2022 good pass rates in most vocational areas\\u2022 the range of courses and opportunities for students to progress\\u2022 well-formulated and effective procedures for the recruitment,support and guidance of students\\u2022 a commitment to quality at all levels \\u2022 well-developed policy and practice for staff development\\u2022 equipment and accommodation which meet industrial standards.2186 If it is to continue to develop the quality of its provision, the collegeshould:\\u2022 improve its procedures for monitoring and reporting on performanceat college level\\u2022 establish a college policy for the management and quality assuranceof external work experience placements \\u2022 develop the provision of open and flexible learning \\u2022 review institutional policy on records of achievement\\u2022 improve attendance levels on some of its courses.22FIGURES1 Percentage of FEFC-funded enrolments by age (1995-96)2 Percentage of FEFC-funded enrolments by level of study (1995-96)3 FEFC-funded enrolments by mode of attendance and curriculumarea (1995-96)4 Staff profile \\u2013 staff expressed as full-time equivalents (1995-96)5 Income (for 12 months to July 1995) 6 Expenditure (for 12 months to July 1995) Note: the information contained in the figures was provided by thecollege to the inspection team.23Figure 1Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies: percentage of FEFC-funded enrolments by age (1995-96)Figure 2Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies: percentage of FEFC-funded enrolments by level of study (1995-96)24 FEFC-funded enrolments: 3,05225+ years16%16-18 years51%19-24 years33% FEFC-funded enrolments: 3,052Advanced28%Higher education2%Foundation49%Intermediate21%Figure 3Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies: FEFC-funded enrolmentsby mode of attendance and curriculum area (1995-96)Figure 4Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies: staff profile \\u2013 staffexpressed as full-time equivalents (1995-96)25 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400HumanitiesHealth and community careHotel and cateringBusinessSciencesPart-tiFull-timScien esBusin sHotel and cateri gHealth and community careHumanitiFEFC-funded enrolments: 3,052FEFC-funded enrolments0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400Full-time Part-timel-timert-ti e 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180Other supporting direct learning contactDirect learning contact Full-time Part-timel-timert-ti eFull-time equivalent staff: 320Direct learningcontactSupportingdir t learningcontactOther supportFull-time equivalent staff0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180Figure 5Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies: income (for 12 months toJuly 1995)Figure 6Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies: expenditure (for 12months to July 1995)26Education contractsTuition feesOther grant incomeOther operating incomeOther income-generating activitiesFEFC recurrent fundinCapital grantsEducation contractsTuition feesOther grant incomeOther operating incomeOther income-generatFC t fundi gi l c t  c t ctt  ii ii e-generatingactiviti sIncome: \\u00a314,169,00012%7% 4% 34%1%20%22% Interest payable Staff costsOther operating expensDepreciationInterest payableSt ff stst  ti g ese e i tiInterest lExpenditure: \\u00a310,930,00057%1%8%34%Published by theFurther Education Funding CouncilJanuary 1996\",\n",

Key Words: Strategy; Maintaining Quality; MSME Products    INTERACTION: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa Vol.11, No.2: Oktober 2024 P-ISSN: 2406-9558; E-ISSN: 2406-9566     255 INTRODUCTION  The development of the food and beverage industry sector in Indonesia is of great interest to investors. Product quality becomes very important because it is not only a reflection of customer expectations but also a critical factor for the sustainability of businesses in the long term. High-quality products foster customer loyalty, leading to repeat orders and positive recommendations. In a country as diverse as Indonesia, where culinary traditions vary greatly across regions, the food and beverage sector stands out as a key driver of economic growth. The unique flavors and rich heritage of Indonesian cuisine provide a competitive advantage, making the culinary landscape a promising field for entrepreneurship.  Furthermore, food and beverages represent fundamental human needs, as every individual requires sustenance for survival. This inherent demand ensures that the food and beverage industry remains resilient and adaptable, even in the face of economic fluctuations. The positive growth trajectory of this sector is evidenced by recent data from the Ministry of Industry, which reports that the growth of the food and beverage industry in the third quarter of 2022 reached 3.57%, surpassing the 3.49% growth recorded during the same period the previous year. Such statistics highlight the sector's robust performance and its potential to contribute significantly to Indonesia's overall economic development.  Given the vast culinary business opportunities in Indonesia, it is crucial for the government and industry stakeholders to prioritize the training and development of culinary businesses. By providing resources and support, the government can play a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of culinary MSMEs, ensuring that they not only meet local consumer demands but also compete effectively in the global market. Improved quality management can lead to increased productivity and innovation, enabling MSMEs to expand their market reach and improve their profitability.  Moreover, the culinary sector's growth has a broader impact on the national economy. It contributes to job creation, with culinary MSMEs absorbing a significant portion of the workforce. As these businesses thrive, they help uplift the livelihoods of countless individuals and families, particularly in rural and underserved communities. By fostering an environment conducive to culinary entrepreneurship, the government can also stimulate regional development and economic equity.  Another critical aspect of maintaining product quality is understanding the supply chain dynamics within the culinary industry. Ensuring the freshness and safety of ingredients is paramount for culinary MSMEs. This involves establishing strong relationships with local suppliers and farmers, emphasizing the importance of sourcing high-quality, sustainable ingredients. By promoting local produce, culinary businesses can enhance their offerings while supporting local economies.  INTERACTION: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa Vol.11, No.2: Oktober 2024 P-ISSN: 2406-9558; E-ISSN: 2406-9566     256 In addition, leveraging technology plays a significant role in improving product quality and operational efficiency. Culinary MSMEs can adopt digital tools for inventory management, customer engagement, and quality control. By embracing technology, these businesses can streamline processes, reduce waste, and ensure consistent quality across their product lines. Furthermore, online platforms provide opportunities for marketing and customer feedback, allowing businesses to adapt quickly to changing consumer preferences.  Consumer awareness and preferences are evolving rapidly, with an increasing demand for healthy, sustainable, and ethically produced food. Culinary MSMEs must stay attuned to these trends to remain competitive. By incorporating health-conscious ingredients, sustainable practices, and transparent sourcing, these businesses can cater to the growing segment of consumers seeking quality over quantity. The integration of culinary education and training programs is essential for developing skilled professionals in the food and beverage sector. Institutions offering culinary arts programs can collaborate with MSMEs to provide hands-on training, ensuring that future chefs and entrepreneurs possess the necessary skills to maintain high-quality standards. By investing in education, the industry can nurture a new generation of culinary talent capable of driving innovation and quality improvement.  Lastly, maintaining the quality of culinary MSMEs is not solely the responsibility of individual businesses. It requires a collaborative approach involving government agencies, industry associations, and educational institutions. By fostering partnerships and creating platforms for knowledge sharing, stakeholders can collectively address challenges and implement strategies that elevate the quality of culinary products across Indonesia. In conclusion, the strategies to maintain the quality of culinary Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are multi-faceted and require a holistic approach. By focusing on product quality, investing in training, leveraging technology, and understanding consumer preferences, the culinary sector can continue to thrive and contribute significantly to Indonesia's economic landscape. Through collaborative efforts, the government and industry stakeholders can ensure the sustainability and growth of culinary MSMEs, paving the way for a vibrant and prosperous food and beverage industry.  LITERATURE REVIEW  Previous Related Study  According to (Nasution, 1998), qualitative research is a research procedure that produces descriptive data in the form of written or spoken words, from people and observed behavior. In this research, an effort is made to collect as much descriptive data as possible which will be presented in the form of reports and descriptions.  Market globalization has implications for MSMEs who must compete in product marketing. The development of technology integrated with trade is moving so  INTERACTION: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa Vol.11, No.2: Oktober 2024 P-ISSN: 2406-9558; E-ISSN: 2406-9566     257 rapidly that it has given birth to the industrial revolution 4.0. The problem is that MSMEs still rely on conventional methods to run their businesses. (Ariescy, 2021).  According to (Kotler, Philip & Ketler, 2020), quality is the extent to which a product meets its specifications. A product is a collection of real physical attributes assembled in an identifiable form. While the quality parameter of a product is how satisfied customers are, not only that, the product can mean having a function of how producers can maintain customers' assessment views of their products.  MSME Products  The introduction of MSME products given at the end of each session made participants more enthusiastic in introducing their product brands. Here they also shared with the facilitator about how to make their presentations more interesting. Here participants also discussed how to make the creative content they created acceptable to the public so that they were interested in buying. Although the discussion was not part of the training material, it provided new ideas for the development of further community service (Agustina et al., 2021; Armiani et al., 2022; Putri, 2022).  Product quality is \\\"the ability of a product to perform its functions, it includes the product's overall durability, reliability, precision, ease of operation and repair, and other valued attributes\\\" or the ability of a product to function as it should to meet needs. Things that are measured or dimensions are reliability, accuracy, durability, ease of operation and repair of the product. Product quality is one of the things that marketers pay attention to in positioning. Product quality has an influence on customer satisfaction. (Kotler & Armstrong, 2012:283; Yafie et al. 2016).  Consumer satisfaction is the experience of satisfaction that customers get after consuming a product or service. Customers can compare the results or performance of a product with other products, whether it exceeds consumer expectations or hopes. If the product's ability to work exceeds consumer expectations, it can be interpreted that consumers are satisfied and vice versa if the product does not meet expectations, it can be said that consumers are less satisfied. (Kotler & Keller, 2012:46; Ogi et al. 2016). In the journal studied by Hawkins and Lonney; Tjiptono, 2004:101; Maimunah & Sardjono, 2019 there are three indicators of consumer satisfaction that must be considered by companies, including: 1. Conformity to consumer expectations. 2. Consumer interest in returning. 3. Consumer willingness to recommend to other consumers.  In order to contribute positively to all company activities in achieving its goals (D.Anggraini, 2020) In today's tight business competition, the most important thing that must be prioritized by the company is the quality of the products or services offered. If a company wants its company to grow, then every company must be able to provide good quality and provide a sense of security to its consumers, because that is one of the determining factors for the success of a company.

Qualitative research is research that uses a scientific background, with the intention of interpreting the phenomena that occur and is carried out by involving various existing methods. In qualitative research, the methods usually used are interviews, observations, and document utilization. The concept analyzed from this study is the Strategy for Maintaining the Quality of MSME Culinary Products.  Instrument and Procedure  The data collection method used by the author is an interview. An interview is a conversation with a specific purpose. The conversation is conducted by both parties, namely the interviewer, who asks questions and the interviewee who provides answers to the statements. (Moleong, 2013). \\\"Data analysis is a process of systematically searching for and compiling data obtained from interview results by organizing data into categories, describing them into units, conducting systems, arranging them into patterns, choosing which ones are important and which ones will be analyzed and making conclusions so that they are easy to understand by yourself and others\\\". According to (Santori & Komariah, 2012), the stages of data analysis required are: Data collection. Data collection is carried out by means of observation, interviews and document review on the research subjects to be studied by the author. Data reduction (reduction) The data that has been obtained is then written in the form of a report or detailed data. The report is compiled based on the data obtained, summarized, the main points are selected and focused on the important things. Data display The next step is to reduce data or present data. Data presentation techniques in qualitative research can be done in the form of tables, graphs, and data presentation can be done in the form of brief descriptions, charts, relationships between categories, flowcharts and the like. Data display to facilitate and understand what is happening and also to plan further work based on what has been understood. Conclusion and verification Next is the drawing of conclusions and verification of what has been reduced previously. Verification is carried out throughout the research in line with triangulation so as to guarantee the significance or meaningfulness of the research results.  Data Analysis   Triangulation is a data validity checking technique that utilizes something other than the data for checking purposes or as a comparison to existing data. (Moleong, 2013) distinguishes four types of triangulation, namely utilizing sources, methods, and theories. The following is an explanation of the three types of triangulation above. The triangulation test conducted by the author is to obtain data through interviews with the four informants who have been determined, then the results of the interviews will be tested for validity using the source triangulation technique.  INTERACTION: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa Vol.11, No.2: Oktober 2024 P-ISSN: 2406-9558; E-ISSN: 2406-9566     259 The answers of the five informants obtained from the interview results will be compared with each other to test the consistency of the interview results obtained.  RESULT AND DISCUSSION  The research aimed to identify effective strategies for maintaining product quality in culinary Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The findings revealed several key strategies that can be implemented to ensure quality remains consistent, thus enhancing customer satisfaction and business sustainability.  One of the primary strategies identified was the simplification of processes. Lengthy production processes often lead to increased chances of errors. By simplifying processes, such as implementing single packaging and pre-mixing basic spices, culinary MSMEs can significantly reduce the potential for manufacturing mistakes. Shorter production times not only minimize errors but also enhance overall efficiency, enabling businesses to respond swiftly to consumer demands.  The establishment of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Station Observation Checklists (SOCs) is critical for ensuring product quality. The research highlighted the importance of creating detailed written SOPs and SOCs, complemented by instructional videos. These resources serve as valuable training tools for staff, ensuring that every branch adheres to the same quality standards. The use of videos is particularly beneficial, as they provide a visual reference that enhances understanding and retention, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high-quality products.  Furthermore, regular training sessions and the implementation of a Learning Management System (LMS) were deemed essential for upholding quality standards. Ongoing training reinforces the importance of quality control and helps employees stay updated on best practices. The LMS offers a cost-effective means of delivering training materials, including SOPs and SOCs in video format, thereby facilitating consistent learning and quality assurance across all branches. Conducting audits and employing mystery shoppers were also highlighted as effective strategies for maintaining product quality. Regular audits at various stages of the production process, as well as during service delivery, allow for the identification of potential quality issues. Mystery shopping, whether conducted in-person or through delivery orders, provides an objective assessment of the customer experience, enabling businesses to identify areas for improvement without bias.  The research emphasized the importance of conducting regular consumer surveys to gather feedback on product quality. Engaging directly with customers, particularly loyal patrons, allows culinary MSMEs to understand their preferences and address any concerns promptly. By actively seeking consumer input and responding to complaints, businesses can foster trust and encourage repeat patronage, which is crucial for long-term success.   INTERACTION: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa Vol.11, No.2: Oktober 2024 P-ISSN: 2406-9558; E-ISSN: 2406-9566     260 Additionally, monitoring review sites and social media is vital for maintaining a positive brand image and responding to customer feedback. By keeping an eye on platforms like Google Reviews, Instagram, and TikTok, culinary MSMEs can swiftly address complaints and implement necessary improvements. Proactive engagement with consumers on these platforms not only enhances product quality but also builds a strong rapport with customers.  Another critical factor in ensuring product quality is the control of raw material receipt and storage. The research underscores the importance of establishing SOPs for the handling of raw materials, including guidelines for receipt and storage. Ensuring that vendors comply with quality standards is essential, as the quality of ingredients directly impacts the final product. Regular audits of raw material storage practices can help maintain high standards and prevent quality degradation.  The study also highlighted the necessity of setting raw material and vendor quality standards. By selecting high-quality ingredients that align with market demands, culinary MSMEs can enhance their product offerings. Establishing clear specifications for raw materials and diversifying vendor relationships mitigates risks associated with supply shortages and ensures a consistent supply of quality ingredients.  The role of supporting equipment and supplies in maintaining product quality cannot be overlooked. Standardizing equipment and supplies helps ensure that all culinary processes are performed consistently, which is particularly important in businesses where not all staff members are professional chefs. Detailed SOPs provide clear instructions, allowing staff to operate equipment effectively and maintain high standards.  Furthermore, instilling a culture of quality and adherence to established rules among employees is crucial. The research found that fostering a culture that values cleanliness and adherence to quality standards is essential for maintaining product quality. Employees should be educated on the importance of following SOPs and the consequences of deviating from established practices. Implementing a system of rewards and punishments based on quality performance can motivate staff to uphold high standards. Recognizing and rewarding employees for their contributions to maintaining product quality encourages continued dedication, while addressing quality issues through evaluations promotes accountability and improvement.  Lastly, the research highlighted the importance of a clear organizational structure within culinary MSMEs. A well-defined structure clarifies roles and responsibilities related to product quality, ensuring that directives are executed effectively. As businesses expand, it becomes essential to have competent personnel in place to manage operations efficiently, thereby contributing to sustained quality assurance.   INTERACTION: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa Vol.11, No.2: Oktober 2024 P-ISSN: 2406-9558; E-ISSN: 2406-9566     261 In conclusion, maintaining the quality of culinary Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) involves a multi-faceted approach that includes process simplification, detailed SOPs, regular training, audits, consumer engagement, and a strong organizational structure. By implementing these strategies, culinary MSMEs can enhance product quality, foster customer loyalty, and ensure long-term success in a competitive industry.  CONCLUSION  Based on the results and discussion, the conclusion of this study is that for the strategy to maintain the quality of culinary products of MSMEs, 12 strategies or stages are required,1. Process Simplification, 2. Detailed Written and Video SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) & SOCs (Station Observation Checklists), 3. Routine Training and LMS (Learning Management System), 4. Audits and Mystery Shoppers, 5. Routine Consumer Surveys, 6. Monitor Review Sites and Social Media, 7. Control of Receiving & Storage of Raw Materials, 8. Quality Standards of Raw Materials & Vendors, 9. Supporting Equipment and Supplies, 10. Rules and Culture at Outlets, 11. Rewards & Punishments, 12. Outlet Organizational StructureTo successfully launch a product must meet the 4 things above, so that the business can continue to be developed and recognized and accepted by consumers. So that the products produced continue to develop and become more widely known by the public. In order to win business competition, continuous innovation is needed to keep up with business developments, as well as the implementation of good management by professional employees.

Introduction The setting of this paper is the implementation of Mystery Shopper visits, carried out by an organization related to the hospitality business with a hotel chain in Portugal and abroad, having the purpose of testing the efficiency of this tool. The study was based on, two interviews, one to the General Manager of the hotel that was the subject of this research, and the other to the Head of the Training Department of the Hotel Chain. Also, two inspection audits were applied through a Mystery Shopper questionnaire, and in addition, information was collected through research in books, articles on Marketing, Management and Quality Management.  In this rapid growing experience economy, customers are seeking more variety and customization than they used to in the past (McColl-Kennedy et al., 2015). Some theories support a systematic feedback to employees on their performance. These theories also uphold that this factor contributes to a critical self-analysis of its output. (Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar, 2012). There is no measuring tool that assesses restaurants nor a standardized and official rating system in Portugal. It is suggested by Liu, Su, Ganc, & Chou, (2014), that the decision-making organizations, including government departments, create or adapt assessment models, and reveal the results with the    Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   488 objective of improving the quality of the food and beverage industry. Food is a very important source of revenue for tourism. (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). As part of the strategy, restaurants can be turned into a tourism topic through its assessment and promotion. For this, it is important to understand how to identify the restaurants with great quality service. This study brings some significant contributions to the extent that it is pioneer in Portugal, in the development of an assessment of the quality of service in restaurants, through the Mystery Shopper (M.S.) tool. Consequently, solutions are proposed so that all the departments of a hotel comply with the procedures, thus increasing the consistency of the service provided and the degree of customer satisfaction. This study makes it possible to see if this tool effectively produces an improvement in the compliance with standards in a practical context and functions as a pilot project, being prepared to replicate in other restaurants and hotels. The purpose of this study is to briefly explain the operation model regarding the implementation of Mystery Shopper visits. For this, a literature review was elaborated to analyze and relate concepts regarding the Mystery Shopper, a revised outline was proposed, and the results were analyzed and interpreted, which allowed the final conclusions.  2. Literature Review Quality, in the tourism service industry, is the main factor that serves to differentiate one hotel to another. The quality of service delivery is the most important element in this equation. (Madar, 2017). Hotel General Managers receive constant feedback from their consumers via customer satisfaction surveys, online reviews, letters, e-mails, and in-person complaints, among others. General Managers also receive information from experts who usually evaluate hotels. This information can come in the form of hotel rating systems and mystery shopping. Management also receives feedback from corporate executives, employees, and other internal stakeholders. However, a key question remains: what forms of feedback are most relevant, and how are they used? (Torres, Adler, & Behnke, 2014). There are several assessment systems for restaurants, as is the case with Zagat Restaurant Survey1, which assesses restaurants based on three criteria: food, decoration and service. The highest score is 30 points (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). Currently, the most prestigious rankings in Portugal for hotels and restaurants are Boa Cama Boa Mesa of Expresso, Trip Adviser, Booking and the Red Michelin Guide2. Studies point to the fact that the latter, influences restaurants in several aspects namely in the change of prices, income and social position of the chefs as well as its prestige. (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). Despite the great influence of the Red Michelin Guide in the restaurant and catering industry, the assessment criteria for obtaining the certificates in the different categories have never been disclosed. This represents a gap in academic research with regard to the creation of consistent criteria for assessing the service quality in restaurants. (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). According to Evans, Stonehouse, & Campbell, (2003) the following indicators should be considered when assessing service quality in restaurants: quality of the ingredients and their production; cooking skill and talent; characteristics of the meal; menu balance; experience of each visit. The waiter is a critical element that directly affects restaurant\\u00b4s revenue. (Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar, 2012). The main objective is to understand whether a Mystery Shopper\\u00b4s feedback can potentiate on job training, improve sales performance, and exceed customer expectations at the same time. There are several studies that focus on the relationship between quality of service and restaurant rating, since quality of service has already been recognized as an important standard in the selection of a restaurant. For Xie et. Al (2014), service quality in restaurants is directly related to the perceived value and experience of the meal. It is understood by perceived value the assessment of the food, service, environment and price. These factors actively contribute to the client's emotional behavior (Liu, Su, &                                                    1Most used guide in the United States for the Restaurant Industry <URL: https://www.zagat.com> 2Restaurant Guide used worldwide <URL:https://www.viamichelin.com>    Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   489 Chou, 2014). In today's dynamic hospitality industry, specialists have to make decisions on how to best allocate their efforts to improve or sustain service quality. Consequently, the practitioners' perceptions of the importance of consumer and expert feedback are particularly valuable. (Torres, Adler, & Behnke, 2014). Therefore, this study intends to fill the gaps of previous studies integrating the Mystery Shopper as a way of observation, with the aim of improving service delivery through continuous training taking into consideration the Mystery Shopper\\u00b4s feedback. Like any external audit, this project will bring additional costs. The Vice President of the study elaborated by Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar (2012) - which aims to implement Mystery Shopper visits in a Restaurant chain \\u2013 explains that $1 spent on the program had a return of $ 2 of profit due to increased sales. Another of the indirect benefits and more difficult to measure, is the improvement of the service provided which was only possible due to continuous training through constant feedback from the Mystery Shopper.  Service Quality Cited in Pinto & Soares (2011), Mikel J. Harry says that, \\u201cquality is a state in which there is value creation for the customer and the supplier in all aspects of the business relationship\\u201d. According to the definition in the standard NP EN ISO 9000:2005 quality is understood as a \\u201cdegree of satisfaction of requirements given by a set of intrinsic characteristics\\u201d. Pinto & Soares (2011) state that the success of any organization depends directly on its ability to mobilize and organize the means and resources needed to produce products and/or services that meet the requirements, needs and expectations of its customers. As such, quality is the engine of success for organizations and paves the way to the effectiveness and continuous improvement of methods and processes. Research on Michelin-starred restaurants claim that more expensive restaurants have more resources to maintain a quality service, food and environment (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). The service industry is the largest driver of the economy in developed countries (Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar, 2012). Since consumers will make decisions and take an action based on their perceptions, there is urgent need for the hotel industry to take an effort in comprehending and understanding consumer\\u00b4s expectation in order to provide good quality services. (\\u021a\\u00ee\\u021bu, R\\u0103ulea, & \\u021a\\u00ee\\u021bu, 2016) According to Gr\\u00f6nroos (1990) service is an activity or series of activities of a more or less tangible nature, which normally, but not necessarily, occurs during the interaction between customers, and service employees or physical resources or assets, which are provided as a solution to a problem or customer need.  The hotel service demands: constant innovation, increasing performance and quality. Quality is directly associated to the differentiation of the service. The more personalized the service, the closer it is to the customer's needs. Thus, differentiation puts the company in a privileged position in the conquest and maintenance of markets. The differentiation of a product or service from the competition is a factor that contributes to the success of the company and to the valuation by the customers. The result is the competitive advantage, generated by the differentiation, creating conditions to increase the profit of the Hotel. (Almeida, 2010). Sometimes there is a gap, between the quality that the company produces and the one that the customer needs, situations in which the company is making efforts and making investments that are not recognized or valued by the customer, thus wasting various resources. (Almeida, 2010). The norms NP EN ISO 9000, presented by the International Standard Organisation (ISO), explicit the concept of quality in the capacity of a set of characteristics inherent to the product, system and process to meet the requirements of customers as well as other stakeholders in the company, considering it as the degree of satisfaction of requirements given by a set of intrinsic characteristics. (IPQ, 2005). From a management point of view, quality is a fundamental concept that branches from the need of companies to meet, or even exceed, customer expectations. (Costa & Sousa, 2011). In order to be able to provide a quality service, it is necessary to know the requirements associated with the client\\u00b4s needs and to meet them or, if possible, to overcome them.     Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   490 Mystery Shopper Although the Mystery Shopper tool it is a technique known and used worldwide, in Portugal it is little applied. The mystery client is a technique that aims anonymous observations of the service provided from the consumer\\u00b4s point of view (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). According to Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar (2012), the mystery shoppers are usually hired by organizations in the service industry, and are also known as ghost, anonymous or secret customers. Through this technique, managers can specifically evaluate standards they would like to see measured. (Sykes, 2011). Several studies point to the contribution of this technique through better performance in a short period of time. After visiting the restaurant, the mystery shopper completes a series of reports, providing all relevant information such as: performance of service providers working at the front-office, product quality, compliance with procedures and other potential problems. (Liu, Su, & Chou, 2014). This gives the manager the opportunity to improve performance - sometimes in areas that seemed to be working properly (Sykes, 2011). One of the internationally known companies providing this service in the hotel sector is the Leading Hotels of the World (LHW)3 through their leading quality assurance program. This program promotes at the request of the hotel, solutions for the quality management, such as mystery shopper audits to the service and training for employees. Sykes (2011), tells us to think about each Mystery Shopper report as an instant picture of what is happening in a given period of time. Since business is not static \\u2013 its constantly changing - the more pictures we get together, the better we know what's happening.  Procedures and Audit The backbone of any quality management system (QMS)4 is it\\u00b4s documentation (Pinto & Soares, 2011). So that the system is not too bureaucratic, thus losing some efficiency, the documentation should be managed in a practical way ensuring that relevant information on quality is reached by all who need it, and it must also be of quality.  Pinto & Soares (2011), define procedures such as the documents that establish guidelines and methods to carry out and manage the necessary activities in order to ensure the Quality Management System. For Pinto & Soares (2011), audit can be defined as actions taken in accordance with a plan established to ensure that the relevant processes and activities relevant to quality are carried out and maintained at an appropriate level of effectiveness. Willborn (2006), states that audits have to be systematic and underline the importance of creating a cycle scheme. It is based on this assertion that, for this study, the scheme shown in figure 2 was created for a more effective control of the inspection. It is based on these concepts that a system was created for the implementation of the Mystery Shopper tool. In order to stimulate research in this area to help the hotel chain with the application and measurement of a quality service.  3. Methodology Following a study by Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar (2012), an on job training program was developed for waiters to improve performance, behavior, customer interaction, and customer satisfaction. These inputs were created by studying the mission, values and strategy of the company, thus ensuring that all employees involved were able to perform their duties and in accordance with the principles of the company.

Figure 1 - Timeline  What is proposed is to create a cycle of audits as shown in figure 2, which can later be used to create a historic of evaluations and corrective actions to prevent the recurrence of past mistakes.                                   Figure 2 \\u2013 Inspection Cycle  The first inspection was done without the employees' awareness in order to analyze the service without any influence. Sykes (2011) argues that once we share with employees the intention to start a M.S. program, we will change the working environment and influence the sequence of inspections.  Presentation of Mystery Shopper evaluations to organization management and operation In each assessment, the results were sent to the administration in the shape of a report where the most important information was condensed as procedures that were more, or less accomplished in the different sale points.

Following the suggestions of the Head of the Training Department, the presentation of the results was very dynamic. We assemble all employees involved in the study and together we filled out the questionnaire used in the inspection by M.S., as a self-assessment. After analyzing the self-assessment score, the real results of the first inspection were presented with the purpose of comparing with the self-assessment. At this point, it is very important to reflect and try to understand the employee\\u2019s opinion, analyzing what led them to make certain mistakes. Over a period of time, supervisors reinforced technical training, taking into account the most common mistakes dictated by the first inspection. The second inspection was then carried out. This time the presentation of the results was simpler, corresponding only to an informative presentation.  Questionnaire designing Based on other studies, the questionnaire was designed based on the following dimensions: (1) Reservation: Assesses the telephone service and the skill of the employee during the conversation; (2) Arrival: This dimension assesses the behavior of the employee in the first contact as well but also how the employee hosts the customer to the table; (3) Menu: evaluates the design of the menu, the language used, grammar, hygiene and if the product corresponds to what is mentioned in it; (4) Order: Evaluates how the employee lists the order by analyzing their speech and expertise as well their willingness to sell; (5) Beverage Service: Evaluates the employee's technical knowledge regarding the beverage service as well the ability to increase sales; (6) Service: Evaluates the interaction at the level of anticipation of the employee in relation to the needs of the client, technical knowledge and ability to increase sales; (7) Employee Behavior: Evaluates employee behavior, language used, how it behaves and relates to colleagues in front of the client; (8) Buffet: Evaluates the presentation, cleaning and functionality of the Buffet; (9) Food: evaluates the quality, presentation and variety of food; (10) Presentation of the table: evaluates the assembly of the tables, the set-up, presentation and cleanliness. Each dimension of this questionnaire consists of several questions with locked answer between \\\"meet\\\", \\\"below\\\" and \\\"Not Applicable\\\". This kind of response, was considered so that it could be extended to the maximum number of standards to be evaluated without making it too difficult to fill from M.S. point of view (Sykes, 2011). Each question was built taking into account the hotel's procedures manual and can thus effectively analyze whether each procedure was completed or not. Another concern in the design of the questionnaire was the order of the questions. These were sequenced according the natural sequence of the service. Thus, the inspector can fill out the questionnaire discreetly through an electronic device such as a tablet or smartphone as the service is being provided and can immediately send the evaluation to the supervisor to prepare the rectification of the inaccuracies for the next shift. The \\u201cprice\\\" was considered too subjective to be assessed in this study. The perception of the price is in some way related to the income of each one, as well as its social class, cultural context, among other factors. For all the reasons, the price was not considered in this study.  !\\u00ba\\t$%&\\t'&(!)(*)'(!\\u00ba\\t&,&(-\\t'&(!)(*)'\\t.\\t!\\u00ba\\t//1\\t'&(!)(*)') \\u00d7 \\t100     (1)  Equation (1) shows the formula of how the outlet score is calculated. The formula divides the number of met standards by the total number of standards excluding those not applicable. The formula was based on the LHW system, the study of Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar (2012), and the criteria created by Liu, Su, & Chou (2014) in their article on evaluation scales for restaurants.  Recruitment, profile and training of Mystery Shopper The choice of M.S. is a crucial factor for the effectiveness of the tool. Contrary to an auditor, M.S. does not necessarily have a specific qualification, nor should they be professionals in the industry. According to Sykes (2011), they may even be the customers themselves of the organization that they inspect. In their study, Latham, Ford, & Tzabbar (2012) developed a system in which the M.S. were the customers themselves and in return the restaurant chain refunded part of the meal money once M.S.    Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   493 completed the questionnaire. Sykes (2011) also says that M.S. has to have the ability to follow orders, have fundamental knowledge of arithmetic and be an excellent communicator and, very important, special attention to detail. Another concern was that the inspector represented the target of the hotel. Before the first evaluation, the questionnaire was tested in another hotel, and simultaneously this test worked as a training for the M.S. As the service elapsed, we filled out the questionnaire to clarify the doubts of the recruited.  4. Results Discussion 1.st Inspection The first inspection took place on March 21 and 22, 2016. Figure 3 shows the percentage score of each outlet. Instead of analyzing each outlet, the decision was to analyze which procedures were not met transversally, if they were not met at any of the outlets it is because the message is not passing properly from the supervisors to the restaurant staff, which means that is where the improvement has to begin.    Figure 3 \\u2013 Percentage score by outlet (1st Inspection)  \\u2022 One of the failed procedures was the attempt to increase sales by offering drinks and complementary foods such as snacks, coffees, desserts, among others. \\u2022 Both at breakfast and in the restaurant, the waiter has access to the client's name. Even so, in none of these points of sale the customer was hosted by his name. \\u2022 In any part of the service was offered reading material to the client, action required according to the standards of the hotel. \\u2022 Except for the restaurant, M.S. evaluated the service as not very intuitive, in example, the client's needs were not anticipated. \\u2022 The only menu that was considered clean and well written was the room service. All others were considered dirty, poorly written, or obsolete. \\u2022 There are no vegetarian options in the menus as set out in the standards. \\u2022 The interaction with the customer was also very weak. The customer did not feel that the service was customized.  There are punctual and simple mistakes that together had a lot of influence on the score, for 58%78%65% 63%0%20%40%60%80%100%Breakfast Restaurant DrinksServicesLight\\tMeals   Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   494 example: lack of the glass coaster at the bar; left elements to be removed from the tables at the end of the meal; the employees did not say goodbye to customers, among others. Also note the positive aspects. The restaurant had a high score. We believe that it is essentially due to the fact that the supervisor himself is present during the period of restaurant service.  \\u2022 In every outlet the food was considered to have good presentation, tasty, served at the right temperature and made with fresh products. \\u2022 In general, employees were considered to have alert postures, a high level of confidence, well arranged and spoken English well. \\u2022 The tables were considered clean, organized and in good shape. 2.nd Inspection The second inspection took place between 8 and 18 August 2016. Figure 4 shows the percentage score for each point of sale in the second inspection. The percentage corresponds to the number of procedures that have been completed, excluding those that are not applicable. It should be noted that the occupancy was much higher during the second inspection than in the first one, which could have been a risk factor for standard compliance \\u2013 more workflow, more difficult to meet the standards. This assumption did not occur. As can be seen, the average evaluation between the points of sale was 66% in the first inspection and 81% in the second inspection - which corresponds to an increase of 15 percentage points.   Figure 4 - Percentage score by outlet (2st Inspection)  \\u2022 Except for the restaurant and breakfast, M.S. continues to evaluate the service as unintuitive, in example customer needs were not anticipated. \\u2022 There is still no vegetarian option as set out in the standards. \\u2022 This time, only in the light meals service, the interaction was considered weak and not customized. Contrary to the 1st inspection, where this opinion had been verified in all outlets. \\u2022 In all outlets the food was considered to have good presentation, tasty, served at the 88% 88%72% 76%0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%Breakfast Restaurant Drinks\\tServices Light\\tMeals   Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   495 right temperature and made with fresh products. \\u2022 Regarding up selling, there is a big improvement but there are still points that need to be reinforced.  5. Conclusion With this improvement of compliance with the procedures of the hotel chain, this tool can be an added value if applied and monitored continuously through an external evaluation that is coordinated with the intermediate managers. At the prominence of a Mystery Shopper inspection, the employees are more aware, and thus, are more sensitive to the detail and the compliance of the procedures, being a very effective tool in assisting the training of teams and also in helping the decision making by the managers. Because at the first audit many of the employees were completely unaware of the standards, a 15 percentage point increase in the average evaluation were expected. In a potential next evaluation, the improvement would certainly be slower. It should be noted that the behavior of all employees regarding the acceptance of the implementation of the project was exemplary. All of them committed themselves to pay more attention to the standards. In the development of the project, there was also an extra motivation and healthy motivation in the performance of the functions, in the sense of trying to see if they were serving the Mystery Shopper. The dynamic of the present ever-changing market is a reality that influences the performance of companies. Although the positioning of a brand may possibly be associated with a type of status/advantage, this does not guarantee that this position does not require an analysis. This should be monitored whenever possible, seeking to assess and correct any anomalies. Managers need to create value not only for the company but also for their target audience, reducing costs, streamlining processes and standing out positively from the competitors. In this way, the tool presented in this study proved to be highly effective, and a good help for managers to overcome the challenges created by the present ever-changing market. It was considered that this tool should be part of the company's strategy and be seen in the long run, so managers can create a historic and simultaneously cultivating the creation of a ranking among hotels to try to perceive which hotels have the highest percentage of compliance with the standards, thus creating a healthy competition between hotels, but also, with the purpose of having an exchange of knowledge, with the responsibility of those who hold the top places in the ranking to train those with a low score. The fact that feedback is given by third parties (M.S.) allows the supervisor to perform his duties correctly, drawing attention and criticizing the work of his subordinates, without worry that the employee feels that the evaluation is personal and partial. We can consider M.S. as a neutral observer, who knows nothing about each employee, than his performance. Inspection reports were also considered, not be used as a disciplinary tool for punishment, but rather as an opportunity to improve and reward good performance. It is very important to publish the results in the internal corridors to remember, motivate and recognize the work of employees. Future studies and limitations Firstly, this study doesn\\u2019t focus anywhere on the quality of the infrastructure at the level of the atmosphere provided to the customers through the decoration and comfort. Future research may include criteria related to this point. Second, food processing consumes a lot of energy and resources, which leads to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, due to the phenomenon of global warming, it is recommended that future research include environmental impact as a criterion to be considered. Third, after testing the score system, it was perceived that the score of each dimension should be analyzed individually, and thus more easily detect the focus of the problem. Fourth, for a more efficient inspection, that is, to make better use of the tool, evaluations should be considered in all departments including: reservations, luggage, housekeeping, reception, concierge, common areas, gym and SPA. One should know that these inspections have a cost. Thus, this cost is    Proceedings Book - IX International Tourism Congress (ITC\\u201917), 29-30 November 2017, Peniche, Portugal   496 minimized is used in more outlets which leads to more reviews. Fifth, no part of this study refers to the costs associated with project implementation. Future studies should include cost forecasts for companies to be able to allocate costs in their annual budgets in a timely manner. 6. References Almeida, A. E. (2010).

Corresponding Author: Vivi Sylvia Purborini: Universitas Wisnuwardhana;  velioraps1@gmail.com  1. INTRODUCTION Indonesia is a democratic country that is secular, and the majority of its population is Muslim or Muslim. In Islamic shari'a the human lifestyle has been regulated as well as possible as a religion that is very concerned about the human body and soul, humans make eating and drinking a necessity that must be prioritized, it's just that Islam has imposed the concept of halal which we must practice, especially everything that is categorized as food must be halal, not the slightest contamination with dubious ingredients. on February 2, 2021, the President enacted Government Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    242 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 Regulation No. 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Sector which automatically replaces the previous PP, namely PP No. 31 of 2019. After the enactment of Government Regulation No. 39 of 2021, the government requires food products, beverages, medicines, cosmetics and other products to have clear halal status by having halal certification. MUI through the LPPOM Halal Examining Agency and the fatwa commission seeks to provide assurance of halal products through the halal certificate instrument. As a guarantee for religious believers in carrying out worship and practicing their religion, the state is obliged to provide protection and guarantees about the halalness of products consumed and used by Muslim consumers (Syafrida: 2016). Halal products are an important part of today's business world. This is because halal products are predicted to have a large potential value and are also promising, not only for Muslims but also for those who are not Muslims (Syafrida: 2016). The Tighe report (2022) released by Statista shows that the estimated potential value of the Muslim market in the world in 2024 is 2.4 trillion USD3 . Shahbandeh (2021) made a detailed report that the market share of the halal industry in the world is dominated by the Islamic finance sector by 53.42% and food by 31.46%4 . Therefore, halal products are not only the focus of Islamic countries, but also secular countries, even countries with Muslim minorities. In Indonesia, halal trends and lifestyles have begun to emerge. This is marked by more selective consumers paying attention to the halal labeling of a product before they make a purchase decision. This selective behavior will certainly encourage the creativity and motivation of business actors to make halal-certified products. In the world, halal food is growing rapidly because not only Muslims are tempted by halal food but also non-Muslims because halal food is guaranteed in terms of hygiene and health. The invasion of imported food is quite a challenge, especially since Indonesia is a country with a majority Muslim population, other countries will compete to reach consumers in order to gain company profits (Peristiwo, 2019). In accelerating the implementation of halal standards where one of the things needed is halal certification, a law was issued to support the implementation of halal standards. Based on Law Number 33 of 2014 concerning Halal Product Guarantee, Article 4 states that halal certification of products is mandatory. The mandatory provision of halal certification for business actors who produce food or enter food into Indonesia for trade should state that the food concerned is halal for Muslims. The Explanation of the Halal Product Guarantee Law states that halal information for a product is very important for the Indonesian people, the majority of whom adhere to Islam. The guarantee of the implementation of halal products also aims to provide comfort, security, safety and certainty of the availability of halal products for the community in consuming and using products (Kristiyanti, 2018). Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    243 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 The stipulation of Government Regulation No. 39 of 2021 dated February 2, 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Sector is a step to reform the implementation of Halal Product Guarantee in Indonesia. This regulation is a regulation that was born as a derivative of Law No. 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation which is expected to be a concrete step to simplify and harmonize business licensing, help create jobs for the community and empower MSMEs which are one of the backbones of the people's economy. However, this PP needs to be reviewed and criticized regarding several things. About the determination that the Halal Auditor is only limited to one Halal Examining Agency (LPH) considering that this profession is a rare profession that has certification, so that if the Halal Auditor is not limited to one LPH, the mechanism and process of licensing and obtaining halal certification can be easier and faster. In addition, this PP also still does not clearly provide information about the financing of conducting halal certification activities for micro entrepreneurs or giving its authority to the BPJPH Regulation. This is necessary so that there is legal certainty and consumer protection for micro and small business actors. 2. METHODS  The research method used is a qualitative approach, which is research conducted directly to the subject under study, descriptive in nature, to obtain data from the problem. Data sources for this research are obtained from Government Regulation No. 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Field, data collection is carried out through interviews, observation, and documentation, with data analysis techniques being data reduction, data presentation and conclusion drawing. The type of research that will be used is qualitative research, which is research that will then produce information in the form of notes and descriptive data contained in the text under study. By using descriptive qualitative research, the analysis method will provide clear, objective, systematic, analytical and critical information regarding the study of Halal Certification on Food and Beverage Products based on PP No. 39 of 2021. Research Method This type of research is socio-legal research. Sociological legal research, namely research that discusses: a. The application of positive law; b. The influence of the application of positive law on people's lives; c. The influence of non-legal factors on the formation of positive legal provisions; d. The influence of non-legal factors on the formation of positive legal provisions. Sociological legal research using a positive law implementation approach to Government Regulation PP No. 39 of 2021. The data sources used in this study are primary data, namely data obtained directly from the results of observations and interviews; secondary data, namely data obtained from scientific journals, legal literature, and laws and regulations; and Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    244 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 tertiary data, namely data that functions to support primary data and secondary data. The data collection techniques used in this study are observation, interviews, and literature studies. The data analysis technique used in this study is qualitative analysis, then concluded using the deductive method That in sociological legal research can be research that seeks to see the correlation between law and society. 3. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION Halal certification is a halal certification issued by the Institute for the Assessment of Food, Drugs and Cosmetics (LPPOM-MUI) which states that a product is in accordance with Islamic law. This halal certificate can be used to make halal labels. Law No. 33 of 2014 concerning Halal Product Guarantee attempts to resolve public concerns by providing clear rules regarding the issuance of halal certificates. Halal certificate itself is a form of recognition of the halalness of a product issued by BPJPH based on a written halal fatwa issued by MUI. Meanwhile, the halal label is a sign of the halalness of a product. Business actors who have obtained a halal certificate are required to include a halal label on their products according to the form of a halal label that applies nationally. Halal certification has many benefits for consumers, one of which is to provide peace of mind that the products consumed can be guaranteed and safe. This is certainly the goal of all consumers. Moreover, Muslim consumers who are ordered by Allah to consume halalan thoyiban products. For producers, halal certification has an impact on market winning in the global market because these products have added value as a way to compete with various existing competitors. Consumer trust will be easier to obtain if the product has halal certification, because of course halal-certified products are safe and guaranteed products. Here are some regulations governing halal products in Indonesia, among others (MUI, 2021): (Law) No. 33 of 2014 concerning Halal Product Guarantee. Government (PP) No. 31 of 2019 concerning Regulations for the Implementation of Law No. 33 of 2014 (JPH Law).

Halal certification involves 3 parties, namely BPJPH, LPPOM MUI as a halal inspection agency (LPH), and MUI. BPJPH carries out the implementation of halal product assurance. LPPOM MUI checks the adequacy of documents, schedules audits, conducts audits, conducts auditor meetings, issues audit memoranda, submits minutes of audit results at the MUI Fatwa Commission meeting. MUI through the Fatwa Commission determines the halalness of the product based on the audit results and issues the MUI Halal Decree (MUI, 2021). Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    245 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 he Government Regulation No. 39 of 2021, issued by the House of Representatives and the President of Indonesia, outlines the exemptions for Indonesia Halal certification.

The process for securing Indonesia Halal Certification for different business types. The Omnibus Law in Indonesia made Halal Certification mandatory for food, cosmetics, and medicinal products. According to this law, there are two types of certification processes depending on the size of the business; the general process (for large-scale businesses) and the self-declarative process (for MSMEs).  Indonesia\\u2019s Halal certification law, Government Regulation 39 of 2021 (GR 39/2021) which was issued in October 2021, will impact businesses in most industries.

The Halal certificate is valid for four years. Halal certification for imported products. Products originating from abroad and produced abroad must obtain a halal certificate through the Halal Inspection Institution in the country known as the Foreign Halal Certification Agency (LHLN) that have a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) with BPJPH.  Requirements: Company/business details, Product name and type, Product data and materials used, Product processing, Halal product assurance/guarantee system document. On Halal World 2023 event in Jakarta from 17 until 21 November, the Halal Product Assurance Organizing Agency (BPJPH) of the Religious Affairs Ministry signed a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) with 37 foreign halal institutions (LHLN). There were two types of MRA signed at the event. First, the MRA signing between BPJPH and nine LHLNs for mutual recognition and acceptance. The nine LHLNs that have signed an MRA with BPJPH for recognition and mutual acceptance of halal certificates are the Korea Muslim Federation (KMF), Korean Halal Authority, Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America (IFANCA), Taiwan Halal Integrity Development Association, The Central Islamic Council of Thailand, Halal Certification Center of Chile (Chilehalal), Halal Conformity Services, The Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (FIANZ), and New Zealand Islamic Development Trust Ltd. Meanwhile, the 28 LHLNs signed up for the second type of agreement, among others the American Halal Foundation (AHF), ISWA Halal Certification Department, Islamic Services of America ISA, Halal Transactions Inc./Halal Transaction of Omaha, Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of Canada, and Halal Montreal Certification Authority Inc, (Agroberichtenbuitenland; 2023). Government Regulation Number 39 of 2021 concerning the implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee sector, based on Article 127 of PP Number 39 of 2021, imported products obtain halal certificates from foreign halal institutions. If you refer to the contents of this article, imported products are also required to obtain a halal certificate if they want to sell and market their products in Indonesia. Head of the Center for Halal Cooperation and Standardization of BPJPH of the Ministry of Religion (Kemenag), Siti Anisah, said that imported products can circulate in Indonesia if they have obtained halal certification. However, the halal certification mechanism for imported products is not the same as the halal certification of domestic products. Regarding foreign halal registration based on Article 127 of PP No.39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Field, imported Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    247 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 products get halal certificates from foreign halal institutions. So overseas halal institutions will cooperate. halal products whose halal certificates are issued by overseas institutions that have cooperated with mutual recognition of halal certificates with BPJPH do not need to apply for a halal certificate. As for halal certification with the category of raw materials, additional ingredients, auxiliary materials and slaughter results whose certificates are issued by foreign halal institutions that have cooperated with mutual recognition of halal certificates with BPJPH must be registered before being circulated in Indonesia. Cooperation in recognizing foreign halal certificates, First of course you have to make an agreement between countries in the form of G to G or Bilateral Agreement. After that, the overseas halal institution (LHLN) registers with SIHALAL and uploads the required documents. Government Regulation Number 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Sector is an implementing regulation that was born as a follow-up to Law Number 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation. It should be noted that Article 48 of Law Number 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation is the result of an amendment to the previous law, namely Law Number 33 of 2014 concerning Halal Product Guarantee. So automatically, Government Regulation Number 31 of 2019 concerning the Implementation of Halal Product Guarantee is no longer in effect and is replaced by Government Regulation Number 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Field. Currently, the latest regulation regarding halal product guarantee is article 48 of Law Number 11 concerning Job Creation, issued to amend 24 articles of Law Number 33 of 2014 concerning Halal Product Guarantee. Thus, overall Government Regulation Number 39 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Sector, the content is not much different from the previous Government Regulation. One of the changes that occurred was regarding the field of cooperation between the Halal Product Guarantee Agency (BPJPH) and the Indonesian Ulema Council.

Thus, overall Government Regulation Number 39 of 2021 concerning the Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    248 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Sector, the content is not much different from the previous Government Regulation. One of the changes that occurred was regarding the field of cooperation between the Halal Product Guarantee Agency (BPJPH) and the Indonesian Ulema Council. A Muslim is obliged to consume halal and thayyib. The halalness of a product is an urgent matter, because this intersects with the faith or spiritual life of a Muslim. The halalness of the product consumed by a Muslim refers to the permissibility or impermissibility of the product being used based on the guidance of the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad SAW. While the concept of thayyib means good, good, and clean, prioritizing product quality, cleanliness, health, nutritional content and safety. Muslim consumers need halal-certified products as well as safe and quality products. The stipulation of Government Regulation No. 39 of 2021 dated February 2, 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Halal Product Guarantee Sector is a step to reform the implementation of Halal Product Guarantee in Indonesia. This regulation is a regulation that was born as a derivative of Law No. 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation which is expected to be a concrete step to simplify and harmonize business licensing, help create jobs for the community and empower MSMEs which are one of the backbones of the people's economy. However, this PP needs to be reviewed and criticized regarding several things. About the determination that the Halal Auditor is only limited to one Halal Examining Agency (LPH) considering that this profession is a rare profession that has certification, so that if the Halal Auditor is not limited to one LPH, the mechanism and process of licensing and obtaining halal certification can be easier and faster. In addition, this PP also still does not clearly provide information about the financing of conducting halal certification activities for micro entrepreneurs or giving its authority to the BPJPH Regulation. This is necessary so that there is legal certainty and consumer protection for micro and small business actors. The Indonesian Halal Product Assurance Law (PP No. 39 Tahun 2021) regulates the halal certification process for food and beverages in Indonesia. This law mandates that all food, beverages, and other consumer goods distributed in Indonesia must be certified halal, ensuring they meet Islamic dietary requirements. Key points of PP No. 39 Tahun 2021 include: 1. Definition and Scope: Defines what constitutes halal and outlines the scope of products that require halal certification, including food, beverages, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other goods. 2. Certification Process: Establishes the Halal Product Assurance Agency (BPJPH) as the authority responsible for halal certification. Businesses must obtain certification from BPJPH or from certified halal auditors. Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    249 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 3. Obligations for Businesses: Requires businesses to register with BPJPH and obtain halal certification for their products before distributing them in Indonesia. This includes ensuring that the entire production process, including sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution, complies with halal requirements. 4. Imported Products: Imports must also be certified halal by the country of origin's authorized halal certification body or undergo halal certification in Indonesia through BPJPH. 5. Penalties and Enforcement: Specifies penalties for non-compliance and outlines enforcement mechanisms to ensure adherence to halal standards. 6. Consumer Rights: Protects consumers' rights to halal products and provides mechanisms for reporting non-compliance or issues related to halal certification. PP No. 39 Tahun 2021 aims to strengthen Indonesia's halal industry, ensure consumer confidence in halal products, and streamline the certification process through centralized regulation. The UMKs as the main economic and financial actors in Indonesia have a high enthusiasm to follow the process of halal certification against his treatments. Such animoes usually come from big food and beverage companies. For example, they are interested in their products being certified halal as a form of commitment to maintain confidence for their consumers. This halal product warranty program by some small and micro enterprises is considered to be overwhelming, both in terms of cost, small enterprises and microenterprises will be faced with problems in meeting the elements of food safety and sometimes also related to the process and place of its manufacture, because halal certification also requires a good and safe way of processing or production of food. This means that halal certification cannot be met without good food production methods or good manufacturing practices. This is because the UMKM perpetrators will take the process of halal certification and huge resources, besides they have to improve the production process. Because halal certification is not only halal, but also must thayyib and meet the standards of food processing rules that have been established. In terms of financing, this halal certificate has two elements, namely administrative costs and halal inspection costs administrative charges according to some of them are relatively affordable although some other assume that the registration costs ranging around millions of rupees it also imposes the Charges for halal inspections which the perpetrators of UMKM judged is very imposing, because the charges will include the costs for halal auditors, accommodation, etc. Based on data obtained from the official website of Kemag as of November 5, 2021 data of the BPJPH Halal Information System mentions that there are about 31.529 Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    250 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 authorities following to certify the validity of its products. This data is dominated by micro-enterprises followed by small enterprises, if in total 76% are UMK offenders (usaha mikro dan kecil). They mostly offer snacks, bread and cakes, drinks and processed products. If detailed in the big five are spice products, spices, condiments and spices. This demonstrates the high level of awareness of law enforcement, especially of UMKM perpetrators, about the importance of halal certification. Specifically for products to be marketed in the UAE and to be claimed valid, the auditor will check compliance with the implementation of the Hazard Analysis CriticalControl Point (HACCP) during the audit.  The Ministry of Religion as one of the members of the Shariah National Economic and Financial Committee (KNEKS) and the organizer of the Halal Product Guarantee (JPH) welcomed the program. The Ministry of Religion has also continued its efforts to meet its supporting factors, such as infrastructure to support Indonesia's achievement as a World Halal Producer Centre by 2024, as planned by the Vice President who is also the Chairman of the Shariah National Economic and Financial Committee. (KNEKS). Other efforts are also to unify the system of economic halal certification services with Online Single Submission (OSS) online through the SIHALAL website, simplifying the series of halal Certification measures that have been addressed in the Law No. 11 Year 2020 on Creating Jobs. The Ministry of Religion is also cooperating with the Ministry or other institutions such as the Finance Ministry, regarding the service charges in the General Service Agency of BPJPH, as well as free service for UMKM halal certification, including also with KNEKS with a focus on facilitating the certification of UMK halal. International cooperation has also continued to be pursued by the Ministry of Religion with several countries. This cooperation covers several parts such as the development of halal quality assurance, halal resources, technology in the field of halal and recognition of halal certificates in accordance with Article 119 PP No. 39 of 2021. This cooperation is also beneficial to the halal investment of foreign countries which will further foster the affinity of bilateral relations, recognition of halal products will be more acceptable. BPJPH provides a wide range of facilities for the process of registering halal certifications, applications and consultation of halal certification through SIHALALAL application can be done from anywhere online. This application is directly connected to the OSS so that for UMK perpetrators it is recommended to take care of the Enterprise Master Number (NIB) before applying for a halal certification so that when submitting a HALAL certification becomes easier and simpler because of the data connected with OSS.  According to BPJHP (Halal Product Guarantee Organizing Agency) Ministry of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia in 2023. The government provides funding and subsidy support as a way to open up public involvement. UMK offenders who Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    251 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 apply for a halal certificate are not charged. In 2020 and 2021, a number of ministries provided certification financing through halal certification facilitation program, such as the Ministry of Religion through BPJPH providing facilities to 3,200 UMK perpetrators free of charge. It is a form of cooperation carried out by the Ministry of Cooperation and SMEs, the Bank of Indonesia, the Ministries of Industry, the Department of Commerce, and the related providers of this facility.  In 2021 BPJPH has launched a joint program called SEHATI or free halal certification, Halal Product Guarantee Organizing Agency (BPJHP; 2023). The existence of services electronically is a support for the service base to be connected to the bottom. Continuous monitoring is carried out to maintain consistency of product validity, and is also related to the actions of the entrepreneurs who keep the quality of the product with continuously. In this case, BPJPH cooperates with LPH or other associated agencies in implementing continuous construction in the management and guarantee system of halal products. But the fact is that the problem lies in the food and beverage production process that is sensitive to the critical point (medium andhighrisk) of the materials used and also the processing process. It's related to the process of halal products that become the evaluation point of halal certification. The availability of materials and the production of halal products makes it very easy for entrepreneurs to ensure that the product is halal. Included in it when implementing this PP on the filing of extension of halal certification. This PP does not require the inclusion of a Halal Supplier report confirming that there are no changes in the PPH (Process of Halal Products) and the layout of the ingredients in the product. In addition to the clarity of raw materials and processes, halal certification adheres to the principles of traceability and authentication. Traceabiliy aims to determine where and how the production process is. Authentication as a guarantee of certainty that there is no ambiguity between halal products and non-halal products, no merging with illegal products into halal products through laboratory analysis. At this level, the impetus of our stakeholders is very urgent to ensure that the supply runs well and is available from the base to the end of the user of the product. The commitment of large and medium-sized producers in ensuring the validity of their products is a way out to deal with the difficulty of halal raw materials, especially for small industries such as meat, fried oil and so on. To support it all, it is vital that there is a development of research carried out by research institutions, colleges in support of industry including research on nonhalal alternatives to cosmetic products or medicines. The parties involved in the process of halal certification are Ormas and Islamic religious institutions, colleges, local governments, associations and so on. Especially in the halal self-declaration scheme provides simplification of licensing efforts and business processes. It is a form of ensuring that halal certification services are optimally prepared, internal consolidation and coordination as well as cross-Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    252 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 agency communication, including international cooperation guaranteeing halal products. Interesting issues about the validity of imported products entering Indonesia. During this time, halal certification of foreign products is carried out by business to business cooperation (B to B). However, with the Act 33 of 2014 and the Creation Act 11 of 2020, as well as PP No. 39 of 2021, international cooperation is built on the basis of mutual recognition and acceptance of legal certificates. (Mutual Recognition and Agreement, MRA). The existence of a halal certification body plays an important role in ensuring that foreign products entered Indonesia in accordance with validity standards. On the contrary, with mutual consent, halal products exported from Indonesia can also be accepted outside the country because there is already a common standard of halal. In Islamic law, the issue of certification and halal labelling is a new topic that has never been explicitly described in the Nash or the classical fikih books. The mention and discussion of food is placed in a special chapter, chapter al-at\\u2019imah (makanan). On the other hand, the processed foods that are emerging and developing today are not detailed. On the other hand, the various challenges that arise from the existence of science, technology, and industry in this modern era, affecting all layers of social structures bring about social and cultural change and transformation in various forms and variations. In addressing this issue, the Islamic Shariah must also provide interpretation and legal certainty on various issues in the field of food. Indonesia, home to the world\\u2019s largest Muslim population, has emerged as a pivotal player in the global halal industry. Targeting to become the world\\u2019s global Halal hub, the Indonesian government strives to ensure the availability of Halal products in the market. In organizing JPH, BPJPH cooperates with related ministries and/or institutions, the Halal Inspection Agency (LPH), the Halal Product Process Assistance Agency (LP3H), the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), and the Halal Product Fatwa Committee. BPJPH also carries out international cooperation in Halal Product Assurance. While domestically, BPJPH has also carried out a number of collaborations to strengthen the implementation of JPH with collaboration between BPJPH and related stakeholders, starting from Ministries/Institutions, local governments, BUMN, BUMD, universities, business associations, communities, community organizations (Ormas), training institutes, halal centers/halal study centers, and so on. BPJPH also continues to expand its synergy with various stakeholders to strengthen the implementation of JPH. BPJPH has made various strategic efforts and breakthroughs to accelerate product halal certification, while strengthening the halal ecosystem in Indonesia. The goal is Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    253 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 to realize Indonesia's vision of becoming the number 1 center for producing halal products in the world. (BPJH; 2023) In a significant move, the Indonesian government introduced Government Regulation 39 of 2021 (\\u201cHalal Certification Regulation\\u201d) on the implementation of Halal Product Assurance, mandating Halal certification for a wide range of goods and services. In addition to the Food and Beverage industry, this regulatory framework also encompasses consumables sectors, such as cosmetics, drugs, medical supplies and devices, clothing, office supplies, and household appliances \\u2013 including their ancillary businesses. To comply with this regulation, each product classification must obtain Halal certification within the stipulated timeframe, spanning from October 2024 to October 2034. Failure to comply with Halal Certification Regulation, businesses may be subject to administrative sanctions in the form of a written warning, administrative fine, revocation of halal certificate, and withdrawal of goods or services from the market. 4. CONCLUSION  Halal certification in Indonesia has been developing as the awareness of halal in the community is increasing. To guarantee the existence of halal products, especially food, cosmetics, and medicines, the government has enacted a Halal Product Guarantee Act. The certification which was initially the work area of MUI through the LPPOM, was then transferred to the BPJPH, which is an official government agency under the umbrella of the Ministry of Religion. There needs to be synergy and co-operation between the government, entrepreneurs, and the public in overseeing the circulation of products so that it can realize the guarantee of halal products in Indonesia.International cooperation is built on the basis of mutual recognition and acceptance of legal certificates. (Mutual Recognition and Agreement, MRA). The existence of a halal certification body plays an important role in ensuring that foreign products entered Indonesia in accordance with validity standards. On the contrary, with mutual consent, halal products exported from Indonesia can also be accepted outside the country because there is already a common standard of halal. In accordance with the provisions of Law No. 33 of 2014 on the Guarantee of Halal Products (JPH), products that enter, circulate and trade in the territory of Indonesia must be certified halal. Registration of halal certification through the Sihalal application that can be accessed at any time and from anywhere online for 24 hours, thus making it easier for entrepreneurs to apply for halal Certification. The entrepreneur also no longer has to bring the files of document requirements to the Edu-Riligia: Jurnal Kajian Pendidikan Islam dan Keagamaan    254 Vivi Sylvia Purborini:Study of Halal Certification for Food and Beverage Products\\u2026 BPJPH office, or PTSP in any Kanwil Kemenag or Kankemenag city/district throughout Indonesia.  The Government needs to revise Government Regulation No. 39 of 2021 on the Guarantee of Halal Products which is an enforcement regulation born as a follow-up to the Act No. 11 of 2020 on the Creation of Works which is the amendment of the previous Act, namely the Law No. 33 of 2014 on the guarantee of halal products. For entrepreneurs who want to prove the validity of their products or register their products must pass a valid and clear halal certification. REFERENCES Afroniyati, L. 2017.

Launched in 2012, it aims to set measurable sustainability targets involving all parts of the supply chain from farmers and processors through to food service and retail. The programme needs to be understood in the context of the work of Bord Bia (the Irish Food Board). This organisation was established in 1994 from a merger of the Irish Meat and Livestock Board and the food promotional activities of the Irish Trade Board, and later incorporated the horticultural and seafood sectors. Bord Bia\\u2019s primary function is to promote, assist and develop the marketing of Irish food and beverage products.Bord Bia receives approximately \\u20ac70 million in funding, representing about 0.5% of the \\u20ac14.5 billion value of Irish agri-food exports. The only non-governmental funding is from a statutory farmer levy of \\u20ac5.9 million. Most of Bord Bia\\u2019s income is used for marketing and promotions and the remainder is spent on specific projects and operating expenditure. A total of \\u20ac6.5 million is allocated to the Origin Green quality assurance schemes.Beef Quality Assurance Schemes and the measurement of carbon footprint The foundation of the Origin Green certification was the Irish beef quality assurance and traceability schemes, which have a long history in the Irish beef industry. They were originally developed in response to pressure from large retailers, as well as the outbreaks of bovine IRELAND\\u2019S ORIGIN GREEN SUSTAINABILITY BRAND  RELEVANCE FOR NEW ZEALAND\\u2019S BEEF INDUSTRYNIC LEESThis article reports on a study by the author on Ireland\\u2019s Origin Green sustainability brand. It looks at what it is, how it is implemented in the Irish beef industry and its relevance to New Zealand. Compared to Ireland, the study found the New Zealand beef industry has been slow to implement important programmes such as the measurement of farm-level carbon footprints, traceability and consistent quality assurance standards.THE JOURNAL SEPTEMBER 202126spongiform encephalopathy (1984-2008) and foot and mouth disease (2007). They set standards for traceability, food safety, hygiene, health and safety and animal welfare. The significant change to these quality assurance schemes with the introduction of the Origin Green programme was the addition of a farm-level measure of carbon footprint (Figure 1). Other sustainability measures included are water use efficiency, biodiversity and energy efficiency. This report focuses on the on-farm measurement of carbon footprint.The addition of a carbon footprint measurement was in response to several published studies on the impact of the livestock sector on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that questioned the sustainability credentials of the Irish beef production system. This highlighted the need to develop verifiable industry data to measure GHG emissions and establish a basis for demonstrating progress. The measurement of a farm-level carbon footprint uses the Carbon Navigator \\u2013 a tool developed by Teagasc (Agriculture and Food Development Authority). The carbon footprint scheme is certified by the internationally recognised Carbon Trust and utilises methodology aligned to specific standards \\u2013 GHG Protocol Product Standard PAS 2050 and ISO 14067. These methodologies use a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach and are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Food and drink manufacturers are independently verified by international auditors Mabbett and Associates.Implementation of the Origin Green carbon footprint measurement To measure carbon footprint, data is collated from several different sources. This includes the Department of Agriculture\\u2019s Animal Identification and Movement System (AIMS), the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) database and slaughter weights from the beef processors. Additional data is also collected from Bord Bia\\u2019s Quality Assurance audit, which requires farmers to record information on all farm inputs and outputs. Following each audit, the farmer receives a sustainability report showing the results and feedback on the farm\\u2019s performance, with reassessments every 18 months. This report identifies areas that can improve the carbon footprint of their farms by evaluating key efficiency areas. These include extended grazing, calving rate, daily live weight gain, improved Economic Breeding Index (EBI), nitrogen efficiency, slurry management and energy efficiency.Figure 1: Reductions in on-farm CO2 emissions 2014-2018Source: Origin Green Progress Update ReportFollowing each audit, the farmer receives a sustainability report showing  the results and feedback on the farm's performance, with reassessments every 18 months.THE JOURNAL SEPTEMBER 202127Importance of Origin Green in the marketplaceOrigin Green aims to be an umbrella for all that the Irish food and beverage industry is doing in the sustainability space. Beef industry leaders have stated that the carbon footprint data is important because it enables the beef industry to measure and demonstrate its environmental credentials. Like New Zealand, Ireland has always traded on its \\u2018green\\u2019 island environment. However, the Irish beef industry found that this perception is no longer sufficient and they now need to demonstrate this is true. Origin Green is seen as a way of future-proofing the sector and ensuring Irish beef continues to be competitive in a changing environment. Farmer perceptions of Origin GreenFrom a market perspective, farmers have said it is difficult to evaluate the impact of the Origin Green brand, especially for returns at the farm gate. They are aware that the Irish industry is dependent on large retail customers such as Tesco and McDonalds and therefore they set the rules. As a result, farmers felt Origin Green has become a standard they require rather than something that provides a premium. Those who are closer to the market through involvement with branded products, such as Hereford or Angus, are more positive about the benefits. Some farmers are also concerned that all farmers are treated equally and there is no premium for those who have a lower carbon footprint.Most farmers commented on the significant additional information required for carbon footprint measurements. Many considered this to be time-consuming and not very relevant to their farm business. However, with increasing environmental regulations there is greater acceptance of the need to record and demonstrate environmental sustainability measures. Some highlighted the benefit of the report in identifying areas where they could be more efficient. This seemed to be a more important motivation than specific environmental concerns. Outcomes for the Irish beef industryAlthough Origin Green may not have achieved all of its primary goals, there are several positive outcomes for the Irish beef industry:\\u2022 The programme has taken a proactive approach to the environmental impacts of beef production and in particular carbon emissions. Origin Green introduced the farm-level carbon footprint measurement in 2012, which was well ahead of any other beef-producing Origin Green in-market promotionWith increasing environmental regulations there is greater acceptance of the need to record and demonstrate environmental sustainability measures.THE JOURNAL SEPTEMBER 202128country. This provided evidence that the industry was taking its environmental impacts seriously and was trying to address its sustainability issues \\u2022 It has been able to produce independently verifiable data with which to engage in the debate on the impact of beef production on the environment. Without this, the industry would be vulnerable to data produced from outside the beef industry and would not be able to question the validity of these studies\\u2022 It has identified some key areas where farmers can make changes to their production system that improve both environmental outcomes and farm efficiency\\u2022 It has helped the industry engage with stakeholders, especially the large retail customers such as Tesco and McDonalds, and supports them with their own sustainability agenda. This has helped keep Irish beef in a competitive position in markets where there is strong competition from local beef.Relevance to New ZealandDespite some of the challenges in implementing Origin Green, there are significant lessons relevant to New Zealand\\u2019s efforts to verify and communicate its sustainability credentials. Bord Bia and the Origin Green programme have enabled the Irish beef industry to be proactive about traceability, quality assurance, measuring GHG emissions and promoting its sustainability brand. It has also been able to extend this across all its food and beverage exports. In this respect, Ireland is well ahead of New Zealand. Carbon footprintNew Zealand does not have an equivalent food sustainability programme that includes a farm-level carbon footprint measurement. This is currently under development, but is still several years away from being fully implemented.For example. the Beef + Lamb New Zealand Environment Strategy and Implementation Plan aims to have a system for farm-level accounting and reporting of agricultural emissions in place at the farm level by 2025. Another document that outlines the commitment of primary sector industries to mitigate climate change is He Waka Eke Noa \\u2013 Our Future In Our Hands: Primary Sector Climate Change Commitment, which proposes that all farms will have an emissions reporting system in place by 2025. This highlights how New Zealand tends to respond to government regulation rather taking a proactive approach. TraceabilityIreland has had animal traceability systems and quality assurance schemes in place since the 1980s. In the Irish scheme any animal can be located through its ear tag. It is a legal requirement that every time an animal moves, farmers are required to enter the new location of the animal in the system.Irish grass-based  beef productionDespite some of the challenges in implementing Origin Green, there are significant lessons relevant to New Zealand's efforts to verify and communicate its sustainability credentials.THE JOURNAL SEPTEMBER 202129In contrast, the New Zealand National Animal Identification and Tracing (NAIT) scheme was introduced in 2012. There was considerable opposition from farmers and farmer organisations who saw it as an additional cost on their business for no tangible gain. They were also concerned about the privacy of data and how government agencies might use this. As a result, the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) introduced the scheme with no mandatory recording. It was not until the recent incursion of Mycoplasma bovis that serious deficiencies in the traceability system were identified. Since then, there has been a major review of NAIT with a number of the recommendations implemented to strengthen the system. Quality assuranceNew Zealand has also been behind Ireland with its quality assurance schemes for beef and lamb. The New Zealand Farm Assurance Programme (NZFAP) introduced in 2017 was the first comprehensive industry-standard farm assurance programme. Before this, farmers had to meet the requirements of multiple farm assurance schemes, depending on the specific processor or customer requirements. Many of these schemes were similar, but often required multiple audits on the one farm.New Zealand beef industry brandingIn contrast to the Irish industry the New Zealand red meat sector has struggled to develop a coordinated Beef + Lamb New Zealand Taste Pure Nature brandindustry strategy or national branding programme that provides verifiable sustainability measures or has the ability to communicate the unique characteristics of our natural production systems. Recent initiatives, such as the Beef + Lamb New Zealand Taste Pure Nature, aim to address this but with limited resources and only in select markets. Potential for a New Zealand national sustainability brandDespite the shortcomings of Origin Green, it highlights the opportunity for New Zealand to develop a similar sustainability brand. It also shows the potential to extend this beyond just the beef industry and bring together all New Zealand\\u2019s food exports. Furthermore, the Irish experience has highlighted the need for an agency or organisation to provide leadership across the food sector to implement change. Without this leadership it is likely that this country will continue to struggle to introduce a unified food strategy or respond to the repeated calls for a New Zealand food sustainability brand.AcknowledgementsThe project was partly funded by AGMARDT.
