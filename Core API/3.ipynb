One of the products of this program is a series of guidebooks that define a NASA concept of the assurance processes that are used in software development. The Software Assurance Guidebook, NASA-GB-A201, issued in September, 1989, provides an overall picture of the NASA concepts and practices in software assurance. Second level guidebooks focus on specific activities that fall within the software assurance discipline, and provide more detailed information for the manager and/or practitioner. This is the second level Software Quality Assurance Audits Guidebook that describes software quality assurance audits in a way that is compatible with practices at NASA Centers\n",

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m Internal and external food safety audits are conducted to assess the safety and quality of food including on-farm production, manufacturing practices, sanitation, and hygiene. Some auditors are direct stakeholders that are employed by food establishments to conduct internal audits, while other auditors may represent the interests of a second party purchaser or a third-party auditing agency. Some buyers conduct their own audits or additional testing, while some buyers trust the results of third-party audits or inspections. Third-party auditors, however, use various food safety audit standards and most do not have a vested interest in the products being sold. Audits are conducted under a proprietary standard, while food safety inspections are generally conducted within a legal framework. There have been many foodborne illness outbreaks linked to food processors that have passed third-party audits and inspections, raising questions about the utility of both. Supporters argue third-party audits are a way to ensure food safety in an era of dwindling economic resources. Critics contend that while external audits and inspections can be a valuable tool to help ensure safe food, such activities represent only a snapshot in time. This paper identifies limitations of food safety inspections and audits and provides recommendations for strengthening the system, based on developing a strong food safety culture, including risk-based verification steps, throughout the food safety system\n",

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m Food safety technology can increase a company’s capacity to prevent a foodborne contamination. A food safety audit—a quality control tool in which an auditor observes whether a plant’s processing practices and technologies are compatible with good food safety practices—can indicate how effectively food safety technology is being used. Fast food restaurants, grocery stores, and other major customers of meat and poultry processing plants conduct their own audits or hire auditors to assess the soundness of a plant’s processing operation. Meat and poultry plants can also audit themselves as a way to help maintain process control. In this report, we document the extent of food safety audits in meat and poultry processing plants. We also examine the associations between the use of audits and plant size, firm structure, and food safety technology use. Results show that larger plants, plants subject to food safety audits, and plants that are part of a multiplant firm use more food safety technology than other plants. Plants subject to both plant-hired and customer-hired audits had greater technology use than single (plant- or customer-hired) audit plants.Meat and poultry processing, safety standards, product recalls, food safety technology, food safety audits, Agribusiness, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Industrial Organization, Livestock Production/Industries,\n",

Quality audit is a review and evaluation of all or part of a quality system with the specific purpose of improving it. It is one of the means to examine pharmacy programs and ensures that the procedures and reimbursement mechanisms comply with the contractual and regulatory requirements. A quality audit is usually conducted by external or independent experts or by a team designated by management for this purpose. These audits can be extended to suppliers and contractors as well. An audit will assess the strengths and weaknesses of quality assurance and quality assurance processes, the results of which assists in improving processes and building a better system for company benefits.

Lack of consumer and producer quality awareness is determined as the main problem by SWOT and Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) studies. A Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) study was conducted by interviewing local stakeholders. Turkish producers' knowledge is limited and their quality perception focuses mainly on food safety. There are barriers in exports due to quality that reduce the Turkish share in world food markets.

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m European food industries are responsible for the safety of the food products brought on the market. Therefore, a legal demanded food safety management system (FSMS) or self-checking system (SCS) is implemented in companies, often based on commercial quality assurance standards as ISO22000, BRC or IFS. The Belgian government provides the possibility for food business operators to have their SCS approved by means of audits conducted by either the competent food safety authority, FASFC, or by a commercial certification body,  recognised by the government. The audits are based on specifically developed guides for self-checking per sector, approved by the Belgian government. In view of evaluating the effect of the self-checking system certification on the performance of an implemented FSMS and the companies’ microbiological food safety output, this paper presents the results of an independent self-assessment conducted by eighty-two food business operators in Belgium. The study was conducted in spring/summer of 2010. The outcome of this study is discussed against national inspection results by the FASFC of the year 2009, 2010 and 2011 in Belgian food companies. The enforcement of a SCS by the Belgian government on the performance of a FSMS, their food safety output and their inspection results is less clear for food processing companies compared to the positive effect for the distribution sector. The majority of food processing companies were already certified for a voluntary system next to the legal demanded SCS. No significant difference could be identified between SCS certified and non-certified companies; large, medium or small scale companies and the sector in which they are working for food processing companies. Five clusters could be identified in the performance of a FSMS and microbiological food safety output. In overall Belgian processing companies are having a good performing FSMS and microbiological food safety output\n",

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m The institutional environment for food quality and safety in Turkey is rapidly changing in the last decade but there are still some inconsistencies compared with the EU. High costs of establishing quality assurance systems (QAS), inefficient capacity of the institutional frame, unknown consumer attitudes, low level of production techniques and lack of awareness of producers and consumers are important weaknesses, when evaluating the current food quality and safety situation in Turkey. Whereas, rapid development of QAS, increase in consumer demands, harmonisation of legislation with the EU, increase in the research and incentives for quality production, and production potentials were determined as strong points. When analysing the socio-economic situation of farms, producers’ knowledge, perception and interest in quality with Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA), it is found that producers did not accumulate capital because of the low profits, a handicap for expanding and investing into production and product quality. Moreover, the producers' knowledge is limited and their quality perception mainly focuses on food safety. As a result, academic studies and research projects needs to be extended and the adaptation of the Turkish legislation with the EU should be completed accordingly.Food Quality Governance, SMEs Barrier for Food Quality, Food Quality Assurance, Agricultural and Food Policy, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,\n",
