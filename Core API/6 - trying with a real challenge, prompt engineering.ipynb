      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m The traditional retail environment, which is characterized by a clear division between brick-and-mortar and non-brick-and-mortar retail channels, has been recently disrupted by developments in e-commerce and mobile technologies. The result has been the emergence of omni-channel retailing. Within the reality of this new retail environment, it has been proposed that retailers should develop the necessary capabilities to fulfill consumer demand from anywhere – the store, the distribution center, or via drop-shipping from a supplier – which leads to the emergence of new operational complexities and challenges in the retail supply chain. In light of the growing popularity of these new fulfillment capabilities, it is important to not only consider the financial returns they provide to retailers, but also the potential impacts on the upstream supply chain. Moreover, omni-channel operations will allow retailers to offer new fulfillment services to consumers, such as cross-channel returns or in-store pick-ups, ultimately resulting in new supply chain service outputs in the consumer market. Thus, the aim of this dissertation is to investigate and obtain a holistic understanding of the importance and impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations for successful retail supply chain management. This will be done by considering three different echelons in the supply chain, (retailer, supplier, and consumer), and investigating how emerging strategies in omni-channel fulfillment impact all three.\n",
      "Using the theoretical underpinning of ambidexterity, Essay 1 investigates how retailers manage their investments and developments pertaining to existing and new fulfillment operations, and how that may lead to improvements in a retailer’s operational and financial performance. To address this research question a structured content analysis in combination with secondary financial data was conducted. To explore how retail omni-channel fulfillment operations impact upstream supply chain members a qualitative research approach was executed in Essay 2 using the case study methodology. Essay 3 employs a series of experimental studies to explore how retail omni-channel fulfillment operations can be used to recover from a stockout. Using equity theory, this essay investigates how, in the case of a stockout, different attributes of omni-channel service operations may impact consumer satisfaction and their evaluation of a retailer’s physical distribution service quality (PDSQ)\n",

Eng. in Logistics)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, 2003.Includes bibliographical references (p. 35).This thesis project explores the possibility to apply project management techniques, specifically critical path method, and PERT, to supply chain event management. The idea behind the project is to create a framework for putting supply chain events into a broader supply chain context and assessing their criticality. Such a framework can then be utilized as a starting point for supply chain event management software applications. The problem has been approached from a \"micro\" point of view, with the analysis and PERT modeling of a single order fulfillment process, and from a \"macro\" point of view, with the analysis and a very simple model of the inventory itself. Finally, there are important factors that can drive the development and adoption of such systems in the future, including a higher level of supply chain informatization, removal of inter-and intra-company communication barriers, and better software integration technologies to effectively link all the element of the supply chain network.by Esmè Fantozzi.M.Eng.in Logistic\n",

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m Inventory management is important in meeting customers’ requirements. Similarly, the effectiveness of supply chain management in the order fulfillment process is critical for the organization to stay in business. Inventory determines the service level of any organization as the adequate and timely flow of inventory across the supply chain and manufacturing processes is imperative for the success of the organization. This ensures high rating on order fulfillment and ensures profitability. In the supply chain, inventory management is a critical part of the process as inventory is an asset and any shortage of inventory impact performance negatively. To keep the right level of inventory is a challenge for all companies and the challenge is becoming more complex with the drastic and frequent changes in demand. This also makes the forecasting process more tedious and difficult. The constant changes in customer preferences with the increases in demand have affected order fulfillment as most manufacturing facilities do not have the additional capacity to cope with sudden increase in orders. They require huge investment and with the shortening of product life cycle, the period to apportion return on investment has to be relatively short compared to the past experience. This affects working capital and increasing working capital is not an easy task unless the organization is wealthy. As Malaysia embarks on the aerospace industry, the dilemma for the manufacturers are similar. The high cost of raw materials in inventory and inventory holding significantly affects order fulfillment. The findings of this study differs from the normal business inventory management practices, thus offering new knowledge and learning curve in the inventory management context of the high technology industry, in particular, the aerospace. The findings indicate that inventory management or the inventory conversion period has an inverse relationship with organization’s profitability\n",

Eng. in Logistics)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, 2010.Cataloged from PDF version of thesis.Includes bibliographical references (p. 83-84).Perishability presents a challenging problem in inventory management for the fresh produce industry since it can lead to higher inventory costs and lower service levels. If a supply chain has multiple echelons, that further complicates the issue since companies have an added risk of not having the right amount of product at the right location at the right time. We conduct our research on Chiquita's Fresh Express supply chain. We analyze the impact of perishability on total relevant costs. Our research focuses on determining the optimal inventory policy for the system considering inventory holding costs, shrinkage costs, lost sales costs, forecast accuracy and service levels. We test the sensitivity of the system with respect to forecast errors and the transportation lead time. We developed a discrete-event simulation model using Arena software to conduct the research. Our research demonstrates that by lowering the current target on-hand inventory levels at the distribution center and retail stores, inventory holding costs and shrinkage costs are reduced significantly. Under the optimal inventory policy, the system can save 31% in costs, improve the item fill rate at the distribution center, reduce the total shrinkage volume, and maintain high service levels of more than 95% at the retail stores. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the system is very sensitive to the forecast errors. Additionally, we recommend keeping the transportation lead time as low as possible to maximize the products' lifetime at the retail stores. Reducing the forecast errors or the transportation lead time would reduce the total relevant cost of the system while improving the item fill rates across the supply chain.by Yogeshwar D.

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m Green Supply Chain management (GSCM) has been the focus of many scholars and researchers in recent years, all with a common interest to determine how companies’ performances are being improved with the adoption of GSCM [1]. However, in most of the studies conducted by researchers, they are mainly concerned with the GSCM in manufacturing industry and less attention was given to the food retail industry. Therefore, this research is relevant and intend to explore GSCM further, especially in the context of Malaysian food retail industry so that the results from the findings will be applicable for food retail stores to contribute to improving the companies’ performances through GSCM. Although, this is the first stage exploratory research from relevant literature within this area, the paper presents the proposed conceptual framework and the research hypothesis to further expand upon in the future research studies.Keyword:Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM), Green Logistics, Food Retail, Waste Managemen\n",

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m Supply chain management coordinates the production and distribution of a product with the goal of increasing profitability and productivity. Advancements in technology and workflows in recent years have enabled distributors, suppliers, and retailers to operate more efficiently and effectively. Although significant technological advancements have been made in supply chain management, inventory management still causes a number of problems for retailers. The average out-of -stock rate nationally is approximately at an 8% level (Corsten & Gruen, 2003). Inadequate inventory management can reduce retail sales, drive up costs associated with transportation and storage, decrease customer loyalty, and ultimately lead to a significant loss in revenue for the retailer. RFID is an emerging technology that has recently begun to emerge as a tool to improve supply chain management and logistics in the consumer packaged goods industry. While the technology has met resistance in its implementation, its benefits still show promise in its ability to improve communication and workflows. The purpose of this study is to establish the need for increased information system technology in the purchasing, merchandising, and distribution practices which are currently being utilized by retailers and mass merchandisers. This study will analyze current distribution and supply chain frameworks and determine the most efficient and cost effective measures that organizations can implement to the supply chain and determine if technology such as RFID can be more efficient and produce an acceptable return on investment\n",

In the global economy, supply chain is part of everyday business across industries, and retailing is a leading example.

At the same time, former pure online-retailers are opening stores or physical pick-\\nup points to allow their customers physical interaction and product pick-up. \\nMulti-channel retailing got primary attention principally in the field of multi-channel \\nmarketing (e.g. Wirtz, 2008). Marketing literature and scholarly research address multi-\\nchannel marketing mainly focusing on customer behavior on the one side (e.g. Venkatesan et \\nal, 2007) and the conflicts between channels on the other side (e.g. Falk et al, 2007; Avery et \\nal, 2009). Several authors (e.g. Schr\\u00f6der, 2005; Schobesberger, 2007; Heinemann 2008, \\n2009) analyze different multi-channel strategies and implications on a retailers' marketing \\nmix.  \\nWhereas operational implications of online retailing have received attention since the end of \\nthe 1990s (e.g. Turban et al, 2009; Swaminathan & Tayur, 2003), specific analysis of \\noperational implications of multi-channel retailing remains scarce. Agatz et al (2008) \\nreviewed the specific supply chain management issues of internet fulfillment in a multi-\\nchannel environment. They identified an important number of topics relevant for e-\\nfulfillment, but recognized that there are only very few dedicated models on multi-channel \\nretailing.  \\nMulti-channel retailers with different business models are using different fulfillment systems \\nto deliver the products to their customers: The online shop of the French retailer Fnac \\n(cultural and electronics products), fnac.com, started its online activity completely separated \\nfrom its store activity, with different warehouse locations and fulfillment organizations. They \\ngradually integrated their logistics activities and are operating today a fully integrated \\nwarehouse, preparing deliveries for the stores as well as for the individual online customers. \\nTesco.com, the online shop of the major UK retailer Tesco, prepares the customer's orders \\nexclusively in the Tesco store next to the customer (Smith & Sparks, 2009). So does \\nmonoprix.fr, the online shop of the French city-center supermarket chain Monoprix. \\nThese observations suggest that a specific multi-channel business model may induce a \\nspecific, most suitable fulfillment system. \\nIf this is the case, it should then be possible to evaluate how a fulfillment system fits a given \\nbusiness model.  \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n3 \\n \\nFrom an operational point of view, fulfillment systems have to be mainly time- and cost-\\nefficient. From a strategic marketing point of view, the fulfillment system has to be able to \\nmeet the customers' expectations created by the chosen business model. \\nWe therefore propose to develop a qualitative framework to evaluate how a specific multi-\\nchannel fulfillment system matches the business model of multi-channel retailers both in \\nterms of the expectations of their customers on the one hand and the economic performances \\non the other hand. This framework should serve as basis for further empirical studies. \\nOur paper is organized in two parts: \\nIn the first part, we will highlight the main characteristics of multi-channel retailing and \\npresent the major elements of the retailers' strategy, the retail mix, which have to be adapted \\nto a multi-channel retailing strategy.\\n 1 \\nWe then will explore the specific operational challenges to be faced when operating a multi-\\nchannel activity.  \\nThis first part will be completed with the presentation of the five major multi-channel \\nfulfillment systems used to deliver products to the customers. \\nIn the second part, we will propose a qualitative analysis framework in order to evaluate the \\noverall performance of a given fulfillment system, combining the two dimensions 'customer \\nexpectations' and 'economic performance'. The parameters of the framework as well as its \\napplications will be based on the analysis of the strategic and operational challenges \\ndeveloped in the first part. \\nApplying the analysis framework to the five major fulfillment systems leads us to discuss how \\neach of the systems impacts the different parameters. \\nWe conclude our paper presenting managerial implications and suggested future research \\navenues to provide evidence if our framework is valid for our purpose. \\n \\nMethodology \\nOur analysis is based on the one hand on our longitudinal industry observation of retailers' \\npractices, completed with the analysis of company information and press articles. Moreover, \\n                                                 \\n1 In our paper, we will concentrate on multi-channel retailers operating at least several physical stores and an \\nonline sales channel under the same brand and with the same types of products. Moreover, we focus on the \\ndistribution of physical products, as dematerialized products do not need a physical distribution. We exclude as \\nwell specific configurations (which may nonetheless be dominant in particular sectors), like delivery from \\nmanufacturers or 'complex assortments' (de Koster, 2002) with bulky items and temperature sensitive goods. \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n4 \\n \\nwe conducted a series of interviews with French and UK senior operations managers and \\nconsultants in the retail sector. This observation allowed us to identify five major multi-\\nchannel fulfillment systems. \\nTo be able to evaluate these fulfillment systems regarding the two dimensions 'economic \\nperformance' and 'customer expectations', we have to identify the relevant parameters to \\nintegrate into our proposed framework. To do so, we analyzed Marketing and Operations \\ngeneral literature and scholarly research. Exploration of the main strategy elements and \\noperational challenges suggests number of parameters, indicating economic performance and \\ncustomer expectations. We completed the identified parameters for evaluating customer \\nexpectations with dimensions from the ServQual and NetQual scales, measuring service \\nquality perception from the customers. \\nThese parameters of our framework will be the dependent parameters, whereas the analyzed \\nfulfillment systems will be the independent parameters. The exploration of the strategy factors \\nand economic performances in the first part will allow us to apply the framework to the \\ndifferent fulfillment models by assessing the chosen performance parameters for each of the \\nfulfillment systems. This shall provide a global evaluation for the each of the analyzed \\nfulfillment systems. \\n \\nSTRATEGY FACTORS IN MULTI-CHANNEL RETAILING \\nThe objective of this chapter is to summarize the context of multi-channel retailing as well as \\nthe main drivers for customer expectations and economic performances, which will enable us \\nto identify the relevant parameters to use in our proposed framework. We will first present the \\nmain characteristics of multi-channel retailing. We then will investigate how the business \\nmodel of a multi-channel retailer, characterized by different elements of the retail mix, will \\nhave to be adapted to a multi-channel strategy. An exploration of the major operational \\nchallenges for a multi-channel retailer will conclude this chapter. \\n \\nMulti-Channel Retailing: Characteristics & Customer Behavior \\nWorldwide retailing is still dominated by the traditional store retailing, as 95% of food \\nretailing and 80% of non-food retailing is realized through physical store-based retailers \\n(Dioux & Dupuis, 2009), and online channels still represent only a small part of the total sales \\nof the retailers. Nevertheless, the motivation to open online sales-channels is strong due to the \\nfact that e-commerce is realizing important annual turnover growth rates of about 30% for the \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n5 \\n \\nlast few years, whilst most other retail forms stay stable or even decline. It is therefore \\ninteresting for a store retailer to invest in the creation of an additional online sales channel.  \\nTo implement a multi-channel strategy, retailers have to decide how to adapt their business \\nmodel by adjusting the elements of the retail mix. At the same time, they have to face and \\nresolve numerous operational challenges. \\nIn multi-channel retailing, customers expect at least the same level of service, counsel, and \\ninformation on every channel (cf. Heinemann, 2008). They expect to have identical customer \\nloyalty programs across all channels, to be able to pay and pick up in the shop a product \\nordered on the web site, or to be able to return and exchange a product bought on the web in a \\nstore (Berman & Thelen, 2004). This channel hopping, which is a legitimate desire from a \\ncustomer's point of view, may nevertheless prove to be very difficult to implement for the \\nretailer (Vanheems, 2009). \\nAt the same time, online shoppers transfer their perception and experiences from a physical \\nstore to the website of the same brand and vice versa. Customers tend to transpose a bad \\nexperience in one channel to the other channels of the same distributor (Heinemann, 2008). \\nAs soon as their expectations are not fulfilled, they may adapt their purchasing habits, in the \\nworst case stop buying with this retailer at all. It is therefore vital for a multi-channel retailer \\nto make sure that every channel always meets the same level of expectations of the customers. \\n \\nMulti-Channel Retail Mix  \\nThe Retail Mix consists of the mix of variables, including geographical location, \\nmerchandising, communication, price, services, product range and the personnel, which form \\nthe overall strategic marketing components of a retailing activity. It is the right mix of all \\nthese factors which determines if a retail concept is viable and successful. \\nCompared to a store retailer, the online sales channel is not only a new channel, but rather a \\nnew business model, where experiences from the traditional (brick and mortar) store channel \\nmay not be valid any more (Heinemann, 2008). Decisive success factors in a store like store \\nlocation, sales personnel and material management in the shop are not the same success \\nfactors in an online sales channel. \\nRetailers which decide to open an e-commerce activity beside their existing store sales \\nchannel have to make sure that the co-existence of the two sales channels is working well. \\nThey have to decide how to adapt the different elements of the retail mix to each channel, \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n6 \\n \\nwhich product strategy to chose, which prices to apply, how to maintain a consistent image \\nacross the channels or what role to assign to each channel, to name a few (cf. Berman & \\nEvans, 2009). \\nWe will briefly describe the major issues of some of the most important variables of the Retail \\nMix, assessing their relevance and importance in the store, the online channel and the multi-\\nchannel strategy. \\nProduct Mix \\nThe product mix is the major variable determining the activity of a retailer. It establishes if a \\nretailer is specialized in selected product categories or a generalist. \\nIf a store based retailer opens an additional online channel, he has to decide which product \\nmix he offers on this new channel. He can offer the identical product mix, a combination or \\npart of his existing product mix or a completely different additional product mix on the new \\nchannel. \\nLocation of the stores \\nA physical store's success is to a great extend influenced by its location. In order to determine \\nif the location can attract the store's target customers, a store based retailer has to analyze \\nsocioeconomic data, transport access, mix of competitors, costs and regulation issues. \\nThese parameters, decisive for a physical store, have generally no influence on a pure online \\nsales channel, as access to the websites is independent from a geographical location. \\nIn a multi-channel strategy, however, the store location remains important; the density of the \\nstore network can be an important factor for offering store pick-up, returns and after sales \\nservices in the stores for their online customers. \\nPricing \\nThe pricing policy applied in a store may take into consideration the environment of the store \\n(socioeconomic characteristics of the geographical catchment area) and the price levels of the \\nlocal competitors. Such a local pricing policy which can be applied in a store is incompatible \\nwith the global price transparency in an online channel and the exposure to price \\ncomparisons. \\nThe pricing policy of a multi-channel retailer encounters specific difficulties: the global price \\ntransparency on the internet, the specific cost structures of the store and the online channel, \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n7 \\n \\nthe existence of specific offers and the different means of payment render it difficult to apply \\na consistent pricing policy across all channels. \\nEspecially the price transparency makes it difficult for a retailer to offer different prices for \\nthe same product on different sales channels. \\nService, store pick-up and return \\nA multi-channel service offer can be composed of special delivery options (delivery speed, \\ndelivery timing, information on order status), the exchange policy, return policy, refunding, \\nafter sales service, payment options and consumer credits. \\nMulti-Channel retailers can offer either to deliver the order to the customer's home or to let \\nthe customer pick-up the order in one of the stores. This service allows the customer to pick \\nup the order whenever he likes, even sooner than with home delivery.\\n2 \\nAllowing customers in-store return or exchange can avoid the cost and time of returning via \\nmail. At the same time, this offers an important possibility for the retailer to create a personal \\ncontact between the client and the sales personnel to increase customer loyalty and to \\ngenerate additional sales. \\nPersonnel \\nThe sales personnel play a decisive role in stores. They welcome clients, provide counsel and \\nadvice and can influence sales. Their behavior and attitude contribute in an important way to \\nthe atmosphere and ambiance of the store and its concept.  \\nThis important parameter in a store is irrelevant in a pure online channel, except for telephone \\nhotline contacts or the delivery service personnel. \\nIn a multi-channel strategy, however, the store personnel have to be able to orient and counsel \\nthe client using different channels. It is very important for the client not to perceive any \\ndifferences or barriers between the channels. \\n \\nOperational Challenges of Multi-Channel Retailing \\nIn general, the operational organization of a retailer is mainly focused on efficient store \\nreplenishment, lowering costs and shortening the product turnover time. \\n                                                 \\n2 In case of unavailable items, the retailer can chose to send the missing items directly to the customer and only \\nreserve the available items in the store for pick-up. In this case, the customer experience will be negative, as the \\ncustomer's decision to pick up his order in the store can't be fulfilled.  \\n \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n8 \\n \\nTo offer an online channel to its customers, a retailer has to be able to manage its operations \\nin a very different way from its physical store activity. E-fulfillment may be considered as \\none of the most expensive and critical operations of Internet retailers (de Koster, 2002), \\nlogistics and stock management becoming core competencies (Benghozi, 2001). Keeping \\nstock of a high number of different references, making it available, picking and packing, \\nsending and delivering quickly at a low cost are the numerous constraints to respect. \\nIn the following, we will present and discuss the main operational issues, which are decisive \\nfor the overall performance of the multi-channel retailing. \\nProduct Availability \\nProduct availability is one of the most important parameters for customer satisfaction \\n(Browne, 2009). A store customer usually can compare the products present in the store. \\nAvailability is indicated through the simple presence of a product in the store shelve. A \\ncustomer can ask the sales personnel if there is any stock of the product or when it will be \\navailable again. \\nAn online client needs to have all this information indicated on the website together with the \\nproduct information. The online channel offers the possibility to display the remaining stock \\nof a chosen product, or even, in a multi-channel context, the remaining stock and the location \\nof the store where the product is available for testing, purchasing or withdrawal. \\nDisplaying the availability of products or the delay of their replacement is an important \\nmarketing tool impacting the sales and influencing customer satisfaction.  \\nStock keeping \\nStores usually receive deliveries either directly from the manufacturer or from one or several \\nlogistics platforms with either warehousing or cross-docking function. \\nAs online orders may consist of different products, composing the orders from different \\nwarehouse locations may prove to be difficult and inefficient in terms of cost and delivery \\ntime. A central warehouse and fulfillment center may therefore, at a first view, be more \\nadapted to the online channel. \\nHowever, multi-channel retailers may as well pick the items for an online order directly in the \\nstores. \\nFor an online order, the retailer has some flexibility where from he delivers the products to \\nhis customers, as he can use multiple stock locations and therefore offer a wider product \\nrange than the one contained in a single warehouse, as multiple channels may share their \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n9 \\n \\ninventories. In-store inventories can therefore be available for online customers' orders (Agatz \\net al, 2008). \\nCentralizing stock allows easier monitoring of the stock levels for different products. If a \\nretailer is serving its online clients (totally or partially) from stock in the stores, the overall \\nstock level on these different locations is difficult to monitor. This is the same problem for \\nmulti-channel retailers who offer the possibility to their customers to order online and \\nwithdraw the product in a nearby store. \\nAs information on product availability is a crucial parameter for the customers buying \\ndecision, the accuracy of the stock level information is very important. \\nOrder taking and fulfillment \\nIn an online channel, the customer enters the type and number of products he wants to acquire \\nand enters the payment information (usually done by credit cards), the online channel \\ntherefore becomes a self-service channel (Falk et al, 2007). All this information entered by \\nthe customer triggers the order preparation and fulfillment process. \\nRetailers once delivering their stores from centralized distribution centers (often with \\ncomplete boxes or pallets) have to re-think the way orders are prepared, as their organizations \\nare not designed for small individual customers' orders. They must therefore be reorganized to \\ntreat these orders (de Koster, 2002), implementing a process of single item picking and \\npacking. \\nAs mentioned above, another option for the retailer is to pick the items in the stores, where \\nthe products are available on the shelves, and to prepare the order in the shops. \\nFurthermore, orders may be consolidated from multiple stock locations (for example from a \\nwarehouse and a store), which needs a specific process. The more complex the fulfilment \\nprocess is organized, the more difficult it becomes to respect the quality and efficiency of this \\nprocess. \\nDelivery to the customer \\nBesides the availability of the product, the different delivery options for a product are an \\nimportant parameter for the online channel client. Different delivery service levels offered \\nlike delivery in 24 hours, delivery to a pick-up point, national post service etc. are becoming a \\nproduct differentiation factor of the retailer. \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n10 \\n \\nDelivery to the customers' homes, which is a distinctive element of an online channel, implies \\nto deal with cost and organizational issues. The usually small transactions have to be \\nmanaged and delivered in an efficient way, while respecting the promised delivery timing. \\nThe costs of the home delivery can be totally or partially paid by the customer. This becomes \\nan important parameter of choice for the client, as no direct delivery costs appear in the store \\nchannel. On the other hand, the costs of delivery can be used as a marketing tool for special \\noffers (\\\"your next order free of charge\\\") or minimum order amounts (\\\"delivery free of charge \\nfor every order above 100 Euros\\\"). \\nDelivery becomes therefore a service parameter, a price parameter and a promotional \\nparameter. \\nReverse logistic \\nStore customers can usually see, touch and try the goods before purchasing. Returns are \\nlimited and very often linked to an exchange of the product, where the returned product is put \\nback into the shelves. Defect products are reimbursed. \\nAs online customers cannot see, touch and try the products, online retailers usually offer good \\nconditions for the customer to return the products they don't like (due to legal and regulatory \\nobligations, but as well as part of their customer service offer).  \\nReturn handling must be quick in the eyes of the customers, either to get a product exchange \\nor to get reimbursed and the customer account re-credited. The process must as well be \\nefficient as it is a very manual process and impacts the stock management of the returned \\nproducts (Min et al, 2006). \\nA physical store channel can be an easy way in the customer's eyes to return the products. \\nMULTI-CHANNEL FULFILLMENT SYSTEMS \\n \\nTo operate the multi-channel strategy, retailers have to set up a fulfillment system to deliver \\nproducts to the customers. This fulfillment system, organizing the process from order intake \\nto delivery to the customer, has to match the business model and to reply to the operational \\nchallenges. Industry players are using different fulfillment systems, and several authors \\nsuggest typologies of fulfillment schemes, focusing on the locus of order preparation (de \\nKoster, 2002; Durand, 2008). \\nMulti-channel retailing per se intends to offer the clients the choice where and how to order \\nand where and how to get the products delivered. \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n11 \\n \\nThe major choice for the client is to shop in the store or shop online. If shopping online, the \\nclient can furthermore opt for delivery at home or pick up his products in one of the retailer's \\nstores.  \\nThe retailer has to set up a fulfillment system able to respect the client's choice of the delivery \\nmode, either by creating a new logistics infrastructure, or using the existing one, by adapting \\nthe existing processes. \\nIn order to be able to analyze the fulfillment systems from a customer expectation's \\nperspective, we decided to distinguish the fulfillment systems by the delivery option chosen \\nby the customer: \\nClients may either choose the direct home delivery for their purchases completed on the \\nonline channel or choose to pick up their purchased items in a physical store of the retailer. \\nThis in-store pick-up is a delivery option only multi-channel retailers can offer and which \\nmay be chosen to 30-40% of the customers at some multi-channel retailers (Berman & \\nThelen, 2004). \\nA client going into a store in order to buy a product, searches, compares, picks the product out \\nof the shelve and pays the product. Single-channel store shoppers may therefore not be \\naffected by the multi-channel fulfillment organization. \\n1. Direct Home Delivery \\nDirect home delivery can be completed either by the retailer's own delivery organization, a \\ndelivery logistics provider or via an external pick-up point network\\n3. Before entering in this \\n'delivery pipeline', products have to be picked, prepared, packed and expedited, which can be \\ndone either in a central warehouse or distribution center, in a store, or in multiple locations \\n(central warehouse and one or more stores). \\n \\n                                                 \\n3 We consider a delivery via an external pick-up-point network (usually neighborhood shops linked to a network \\nwhich offers the retreat of parcels for the clients of different retailers) like a home delivery, as the fulfillment \\nprocess is quite identical, with a delivery of (sometimes pre-sorted) parcels to the pick-up point network's \\ninjection hub. Although this is influencing the ease of access, this way of delivery cannot provide a contact with \\nthe retailer as in his own store. \\n \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n12 \\n \\n1.1 Direct Delivery from central warehouse \\n \\nPicking, preparation and packing of ordered \\nitems can be done from a central warehouse \\nstocking the products (Figure 1.1). This central \\nwarehouse can either be a purpose-built entity \\nto serve exclusively the online channel or the \\nexisting warehouse for the store operations (in \\nwhich case the processes in the warehouse \\nhave to be adapted). \\n \\n1.2 Direct Delivery from a store \\n \\nPicking, preparation and packing of the \\nordered items can be done inside a physical \\nstore out of the shelves.

We will conclude this part discussing the limitations of the framework, \\nsuggestions for further research and managerial implications.  \\nCustomer expectations and economic performance \\nHaving analyzed the main strategy factors and operational challenges, and identified the five \\nmajor fulfillment systems, we now have to determine the parameters to include into our \\nproposed framework in order to evaluate these fulfillment systems. \\nThe different fulfillment systems lead to different levels of complexity, of costs and of \\nproduct availability and therefore different levels of customer satisfaction and economic \\nperformance. \\nTo explore how a fulfillment system fits a given business model, we have to evaluate the \\noverall performance of the different multi-channel fulfillment systems, combining the two \\nangles of analysis:  On the one hand, we analyze to which extend a given fulfillment system is \\nable to meet the customer expectations. On the other hand, we analyze the economic \\nperformance of each model. \\nIn our proposed framework, we will confront the different fulfillment systems to several \\nparameters which are relevant for the customer expectations and the economic performance. \\nThe fulfillment systems may be considered as the independent variables of our analysis, \\nwhereas the different parameters of our framework represent the dependent variables. \\nThe identification of these parameters results from the exploration of the main strategy \\nelements and operational challenges. \\nConcerning the economic performances of fulfillment, we propose to assess different \\ndimensions of the overall fulfillment efficiency, combining widely used indicators to describe \\nlogistics and fulfillment performances (e.g. in Agatz et al, 2008): \\n\\u2010  Stock efficiency (indicating reliable sales forecasts and optimized product \\nreplenishment to reduce stock-risk, capability of monitoring stock levels across different \\nstock locations and the capability of balancing stock between different locations) \\n\\u2010  Picking efficiency (indicating efficient organization of stock and picking zones for \\npicking and order preparation) \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n15 \\n \\n\\u2010  Delivery cost efficiency (indicating the total cost of delivery from the stock(s) to the \\ncustomers' home or to the desired store for pick-up) \\n\\u2010  Channel organization efficiency (indicating the information exchange between sales \\nchannels and real time availability of data) \\n\\u2010  Fulfillment infrastructure costs (indicating the necessary investments, rents or \\noutsourcing costs for the fulfillment infrastructure) \\n\\u2010  Return handling efficiency (indicating the speed and quality of the return handling \\nprocess, from product reception to exchange or reimbursement for the client) \\n \\nAnalysis in the first part of this paper suggests three parameters indicating the customer \\nexpectations: \\n\\u2010  Product availability (indicating the availability of the desired products) \\n\\u2010  Speed of delivery (indicating the time between the order placement and the reception \\nof the products by the customers) \\n\\u2010  Ease of access and return of products (indicating the ease for a client either to get the \\nproducts delivered/to pick them up or to return/exchange the products received) \\nIn order to assess more precisely how a fulfillment system corresponds to the customer \\nexpectations, we completed these parameters with parameters from the ServQual framework, \\ndeveloped by Parasuraman et al (1988) to measure service quality. Nevertheless, this \\ntraditional service quality may not be applicable in an online environment (Parasuraman et al, \\n2005). Bressolles (2006) developed the NetQual framework to specifically assess electronic \\nservice quality.  \\nAs multi-channel retailing provides both 'traditional' and 'online' service experiences, we have \\nto combine these two approaches in order to identify all the relevant dimensions to customer \\nexpectations and retain only those which may be directly impacted by the fulfilment model.  \\nTherefore, we selected the following dimensions out of the ServQual and NetQual scales for \\nour analysis: \\n\\u2010  Quality and quantity of information ( NetQual) (indicating the availability and \\ncorrectness of the information provided in terms of product availability, stock level, delivery \\ntimes etc. either on the website or in the stores)  \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n16 \\n \\n\\u2010  Reliability and respect of commitments (ServQual & NetQual) (indicating the ability \\nto deliver the products in terms of quantity, price, description and timing) \\n\\u2010  Offer (NetQual) (indicating the lengths and the width of the product range available on \\nthe different channels) \\n\\u2010  Assurance (ServQual) (indicating the competence and friendliness of the personnel \\nusually in the store for buying, pick-up and exchange transactions of the client). \\n \\nWe did not retain those dimensions having only an indirect link with the fulfillment systems. \\nThese elements constitute the analysis framework we propose to analyze the overall \\nperformance of specific fulfillment systems. \\nApplication of the Analysis Framework \\n \\nWe are now able to apply this proposed framework to the five identified fulfillment systems \\naccording to our objective to evaluate the fit between a multi-channel retailer's business \\nmodel and a specific fulfillment system. \\nTo be able to analyze each of the abovementioned fulfillment systems, we will explore the \\nsensitivity of each of the parameters regarding the main characteristics of the different \\nfulfillment systems.\\n4 We apply numerical scores to each parameter, depending if the \\nefficiency of this parameter is high (2), medium (1) or low (0). This qualitative evaluation, \\nbased on the discussion of the different elements of the retail mix and the operational \\nchallenges, aims to compare the relative efficiency of one parameter in different fulfillment \\nsystems. We do not intend to provide an absolute performance test. \\nQuality and Quantity of Information \\nCustomers expect correct information, especially on pricing and delivery costs of the different \\nchannels, but as well on other parameters like product availability, speed of delivery and \\nproduct characteristics. The retailer's challenge is always to have the right information \\navailable on every channel. \\n                                                 \\n4 Each of the above identified parameters expressing customer expectations and economic performance of a \\nspecific fulfillment system has multiple implications on other parameters. It is to retain that these parameters \\nmay be interdependent (e.g. the width of the product offer impacts the product availability, the picking \\nefficiency and the fulfillment infrastructure costs). \\n \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n17 \\n \\nUsing a centralized stock provides the highest chance to have the right information available \\n(score: 2), whereas an order preparation from stores induces the problem of obtaining the \\nright information on the store stock level (score: 1). If the order preparation has to be \\ncompleted on several stock locations (central warehouse and stores), it is very difficult to \\nobtain correct information and the quality of information may be low (score: 0). \\nReliability and Respect of commitments \\nCustomers expect retailers to keep their promises, especially in terms of delivery time and \\ndelivery service. Central warehouse order preparation should facilitate this, as the quality of \\ninformation is high and the fulfillment process can be optimized (score: 2). Order preparation \\nin the stores suffers from difficulties in keeping a real-time stock level of all the products. \\nTherefore, store preparation may guarantee only a medium level of reliability and respect of \\ncommitments (score: 1), whereas multi-stock order preparation may only provide a low level \\n(score: 0).  \\nOffer \\nCustomers expect to find the offer they expect on every channel, a large or narrow product \\nrange with the appropriate depth of assortment. The retailer has to make sure to be able to \\noffer the products customers expect on every channel. \\nOrder fulfillment at a central warehouse or from multiple stocks should be capable to provide \\nthe entire range of the products (both score: 2), order preparation at the store is limited to the \\nonly product assortment in stock at the store (score: 0). \\nProduct availability \\nThe customer expects that the products he intends to buy are available in the channel he \\ndesires to use. \\nA central warehouse order preparation may provide only a medium level of product \\navailability (score: 1) compared to the other options, as the availability depends on the stock \\nkeeping and forecasting precision of this single warehouse. Stores can only guarantee a low \\nlevel of product availability because of the small number of stock for every referenced \\nproduct and the continuous buying from customers in the store (score: 0).  \\nMulti-stock order preparation may use the stock of different entities (stores and central \\nwarehouse) and therefore guarantee a very high level of product availability (score: 2), \\nespecially in case of a high number of articles per customer order. \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n18 \\n \\nSpeed of delivery \\nCustomers usually expect a rapid delivery of the products they bought and to be informed \\nabout the delivery timing. Retailers therefore have to implement a fast and reliable delivery \\nprocess, which may imply an external delivery service provider. \\nA central warehouse usually needs to bridge the distance to the final customer, which may be \\nlong and therefore time-consuming. A medium level of speed of delivery may therefore be \\nguaranteed (score: 1). As stores are closer to the final customer, the speed of delivery can be \\nhigh when orders are prepared in the store (score: 2). Orders prepared from multiple stock \\nlocations need a long time to be consolidated and can therefore only provide a low relative \\ndelivery speed (score: 0). \\nEase of access and return of products \\nCustomers expect easy access to the retailer to either pick up the products ordered or to return \\nor exchange a product in case of dissatisfaction. \\nHome delivery from a central warehouse may make returns and exchange difficult for \\ncustomers (score: 0), who have to use a postal service for returning the products (except in the \\ncase the retailer owns a quite dense network of stores and the store channel is fully integrated \\nto handle returns and exchange from the online channel). Order preparation in the store is \\nusually done in the store closest to the customer. This store is therefore easy to access for the \\ncustomer (score: 2). Multi-stock preparation can only provide a medium level of ease of \\naccess and return (score: 1). Although the customer can return a product to the closest store, \\nexchange can be impossible if the products to be exchanged are only available at another \\nstock location. \\nAssurance \\nThe customers expect competent and friendly personnel in the store for buying, picking up \\ntheir orders, return or exchange. The same expectation may apply for the personnel on \\ntelephone customer hotlines or the delivery personnel. These functions being very often \\noutsourced (especially the latter), retailers have to focus on their own sales personnel and \\nmake sure they provide the level of assurance the customer is expecting by providing the \\nsame information to all channels. The assurance of the personnel can only be provided in the \\ncase of order pick-up of the customer in the stores (score: 2; other option scores: 0). \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n19 \\n \\nStock efficiency \\nFor the retailer, the efficiency of stock management is crucial for numerous reasons. Stock \\nkeeping and monitoring of stock levels, balancing between different stock locations and the \\nforecasting of sales and product reorders influence the availability of the products and \\ntherefore the sales. Efficient stock handling is as well an important cost element. \\nCentral stock management can provide a high level of efficiency (score: 2), whereas a store \\ncan only provide a medium efficiency (score: 1) because of the low number of products per \\narticle and the continuous stock movement due to customers purchases out of the shelves. The \\nhandling of multiple stocks in the fulfillment process is the least efficient (score: 0). \\nPicking efficiency \\nThe picking of products out of stock to prepare the customer's order is the key process of the \\noverall fulfillment process, representing a very important part of the warehouse operating \\ncosts. This process is nevertheless transparent to the customer. \\nA central warehouse can be organized in a way to optimize the picking process by planning \\nand reducing the way picking operators have to go during the process (score: 2). Depending \\non the volumes and the type of articles, it is possible to split the stock for whole cartons or \\nopen cartons picking or separate zones for stocking and picking. This optimization cannot be \\nprovided in a store or in multiple stock sites (scores: 0). Stores' layouts and product locations \\nare planned to make the customer spend the maximum time in the store and not to optimize \\nthe picking (de Koster, 2002). \\nDelivery cost efficiency \\nCustomers expect to pay the lowest extra cost possible for the delivery of their online orders \\nand the retailer has to reduce the overall cost of the delivery. \\nDelivery of orders prepared in a central warehouse has always to include the transport to the \\ncustomer's home and therefore only achieve a medium efficiency (score: 1) compared to the \\ndelivery from a store (score: 2), where the distance to the final customer is short. Pick-up by \\nthe customer from the store where the order was prepared is the less costly way of delivery \\nfor the retailer. Any delivery from an order prepared in multiple stock locations (for home \\ndelivery or to a store for pick-up) is least efficient (score: 0), as the consolidation process of \\nthe order implies multiple costs of handling and transportation. \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n20 \\n \\nChannel organization efficiency \\nAs stated above, customers want to be able to use different channels simultaneously. A \\nretailer has therefore to manage all the channels in an integrated manner.  \\nPreparing orders for home delivery from a central warehouse is the simplest and most \\nefficient organization (score: 2). Order preparation in the store involves the online and the \\nstore channel in the fulfillment process, therefore adding a level of complexity (score: 1). \\nMulti-stock preparation adds further complexity, being therefore the most difficult solution to \\nachieve an efficient channel organization (score: 0). \\nFulfillment infrastructure costs \\nThe fulfillment process may generate important investment costs, when a specific site is built \\nas the stock and the distribution center, or if the design and the organization of an existing \\nfacility have to be modified. Renting or outsourcing this infrastructure generates additional \\ncosts as well. \\nA central warehouse order preparation generates a high infrastructure cost (score: 0), whereas \\nthe store preparation generates the lowest additional infrastructure costs (score: 2). Order \\npreparation from multiple stocks may generate medium additional infrastructure costs (score: \\n1) to organize the consolidation of the orders. \\nReturn handling efficiency \\nCustomers expect their returns to be processed quickly, to receive an exchange product or to \\nget reimbursed the purchasing price. The retailer must therefore provide a quick and efficient \\nreturn handling process. \\nA central warehouse enables creation of optimized return processing (score: 2) to check the \\nreturns, repack and restock them and send the exchange items to the customers. Multi-stock \\nfulfillment can only provide a lower rate of return efficiency (score: 1), as the returned items \\narrive in different locations and the exchange items may only be available on different stock \\nlocations. For a store it is very difficult to offer an optimized return process (score: 0), \\nespecially when returned products are not part of the store's product offer. \\n \\nWe can therefore summarize the impacts of the different fulfillment systems on the different \\nparameters as follows (Figure 3): \\n \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n21 \\n \\nFigure 3: The Analysis Framework \\n  Home Delivery  Customer Store \\nPick-up \\nFulfillment  system  1.1 1.2 1.3 2.1 2.2 \\n Prepared  in \\ncentral \\nwarehouse \\nPrepared in \\nstore \\nPrepared in \\nmultiple \\nstocks \\nPrepared in \\nstore \\nPrepared in \\nmultiple \\nstocks \\nCustomer Expectations       \\nQuality and quantity of information  High (2)  Medium (1)  Low (0)  Medium (1)  Low (0) \\nReliability and respect of commitments  High (2)  Medium (1)  Low (0)  Medium (1)  Low (0) \\nOffer  Medium (1)  Low (0)  High (2)  Low (0)  High (2) \\nProduct availability  Medium (1)  Low (0)  High (2)  Low (0)  High (2) \\nSpeed of delivery  Medium (1)  High (2)  Low (0)  High (2)  Low (0) \\nEase of access and return of products  Low (0)  High (2)  Medium (1)  High (2)  Medium (1) \\nAssurance  Low (0)  Low (0)  Low (0)  High (2)  High (2) \\n       \\nEconomic performance       \\nStock efficiency  High (2)  Medium (1)  Low (0)  Medium (1)  Low (0) \\nPicking efficiency   High (2)  Low (0)  Low (0)  Low (0)  Low (0) \\nDelivery cost efficiency  Medium (1)  High (2)  Low (0)  High (2)  Low (0) \\nChannel organization efficiency  High (2)  Medium (1)  Low (0)  Medium (1)  Low (0) \\nFulfillment infrastructure costs \\nefficiency \\nLow (0)  High (2)  Medium (1)  High (2)  Medium (1) \\nReturn handling efficiency  High (2)  Low (0)  Medium (1)  Low (0)  Medium (1) \\n       \\nTotal Score Customer expectations 7 6 5 8 7 \\nTotal Score Economic performance 9 6 2 6 2 \\nTotal 16 12  7  14  9 \\n \\n \\nThis indicates several results: \\n- Home delivery from a central warehouse (System 1.1) is the fulfillment system best meeting \\nthe combination of the two dimensions customer expectations and economic performance, \\nproviding a total score of 16.

In terms of economic \\nperformance, these two systems provide the lowest score (2). \\n- Economic performances of order preparation in the store or from multiple stocks are \\nidentical for both home delivery or in-store pick up by the customer. The difference in \\ncustomer expectations (difference of 2) results from the possibility to have a personal contact \\nwith the customer, therefore responding to the customer expectation of 'Assurance', which can \\nonly be provided in a store. \\nDISCUSSION, MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS AND RESEARCH AVENUES \\n \\nThe qualitative analysis of the different fulfillment systems and their impact on customer \\nexpectations and economic performance reveals that different fulfillment systems can provide \\nhigh overall performance levels in terms of customer expectations and economic \\nperformance. \\nThe framework shows that orders for home delivery prepared in a central warehouse present \\nonly a slightly higher overall performance than an order prepared in a store for customer \\nstore-pick-up. \\nA retailer has to assess the importance of each of the analyzed parameters for his specific \\nretail mix and to optimize the trade-offs between channel fulfillment synergies and specific \\nneeds on different channels. Depending on the product mix between food and non-food \\nproducts, the width of product assortment and the characteristics of the existing store \\nnetwork, specific solutions may be more appropriate than others to fit with a specific business \\nmodel. \\nWhereas proximity to customers is best achieved through a store network, stores add \\ncomplexity on different levels in the fulfillment process which affect timing, costs and \\nreliability. \\nMulti-stock consolidation seems to be always by far the less efficient model, regarding the \\ncustomer expectations and the economic performance. This corresponds to the three initially \\nmentioned multi-channel retailers: Fnac abandoned the multi-stock preparation and \\ncompletely integrated their fulfillment for the different channels, and neither Tesco nor \\nMonoprix apply a multi-stock solution, whilst optimizing the in-store order preparation. \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n23 \\n \\nOur proposed framework could prove useful for multi-channel retailers in various ways: It \\nprovides a tool to evaluate the chosen fulfillment system and therefore identifying \\nimprovement potentials on specific parameters. \\nIt could also provide helpful to measure customer satisfaction. Moreover, it should clearly be \\nuseful in anticipating the needs for fulfillment systems when planning to implement a multi-\\nchannel strategy. \\nThe proposed qualitative framework should be further validated by conducting supplementary \\nempirical analysis, although it may be difficult to compare economic performances and \\ncustomer expectations of different fulfillment systems in a same company. Another difficulty \\nmay be to isolate the impacts of the supply chain from other impacts (marketing, pricing, \\nproduct policy etc.). \\nA limitation of our framework is the fact that it does not assess the interdependencies between \\nthe different dependent parameters, but only focuses on one major impact at a time. \\nA first step to further back this framework could be to conduct a dynamic analysis through a \\nsimulation, testing values for the different parameters of the analysis framework. \\nResearch could aim to find evidence if there is an 'optimum' fulfillment system for every \\nmulti-channel retailer. Such an optimal model could be defined depending on different \\nindependent variables like product assortment, average number of items per shopping basket, \\nvalue of products, product characteristics, degree of channel integration etc. This would also \\ninclude an analysis of the trade-off between cost- and customer service level optimization. \\nSuch a research could as well reveal that there is no optimum model, but just a set of \\nindependent and non stabilized models evolving quickly as the retailers' strategy mix evolves. \\n \\n \\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \\n \\nThe work on this paper was partially supported by the Innovation and Regulation Chair of \\nOrange, Ecole Polytechnique, Telecom Paris. \\nh\\na\\nl\\n-\\n0\\n0\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n9\\n5\\n6\\n,\\n \\nv\\ne\\nr\\ns\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n \\n-\\n \\n3\\n1\\n \\nJ\\na\\nn\\n \\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010 \\n \\n24 \\n \\nREFERENCES \\n \\nAgatz N., Fleischmann M., van Nunen J.

Appendix ............................................................................................................................. 164   1  I. Introduction  The traditional retail environment, characterized by a clear division between brick-and-mortar and non-brick-and-mortar retailers, experienced a recent shift by the emergence of e-commerce and mobile technologies (Brynjolfsson, Hu, and Rahman 2013; Rigby 2011). In this new retail environment, the clear division between physical and digital retail channels has been slowly diminishing. Now, a new integrated omni-channel retail environment (Brynjolfsson et al. 2013) with multiple touch-points (Wallace et al. 2004) and innovative services, such as in-store pick up (Vishwanath and Mulvin 2001) and the ability to return online purchases at a physical store is emerging (Bendoly et al. 2005). However, retailers offering consumers with these innovative fulfillment services spanning multiple channels are likely to also face difficulties and challenges in managing and executing their retail supply chain operations in an efficient and effective manner. While some retailers, such as Nordstrom, Apple, or Walmart for instance, excel with their omni-channel fulfillment operations, the reality is that the majority of retailers struggle with the realization and management of their omni-channel fulfillment operations (Forrester Research, Inc. 2014). Omni-channel fulfillment operations are those activities that span from consumers placing orders from multiple touch points (i.e. store, website, mobile device) to retailers fulfilling those orders from multiple touch points (i.e. store, DC, or manufacturer), ultimately resulting in customer satisfaction (Pyke et al. 2001; Strang 2013). Research suggests that retailers with effective omni-channel retail service operations management are able to gain a competitive advantage (Burke 2002; Weinberg et al. 2007). However, the majority of the research on retail operations focuses on investigating operations within a single channel, neglecting the emerging operational complexity of omni-channel retailing (Agatz et al. 2008). 2  Thus, important and interesting research questions pertaining to omni-channel fulfillment operations are still unanswered and warrant further exploration.   Apple, for example, became a leading omni-channel retailer by taking advantage of its already established fulfillment operations of its brick-and-mortar and online channel through integrating the respective channel operations to develop and establish new fulfillment operations opportunities. This anecdotal evidence of Apple advocates the importance of adopting new fulfillment operations for retailers to be successful within the new reality of omni-channel retailing. It is proposed that retailers developing the necessary capabilities to fulfill consumer demand from anywhere \\u2013 the store, the distribution center, or via drop-shipping from a supplier (Strang 2013) \\u2013 is leading to the emergence of new operational complexities and challenges in the retail supply chain.  While these new fulfillment operations enable retailers to offer new services to consumers, such as cross-channel returns or in-store pick-ups (Vishwanath and Mulvin 2001), they might also have significant impacts on the upstream supply chain as well. However, current research falls short in terms of considering the potential impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations on different echelons in the supply chain. Thus, the aim of this dissertation is to investigate and obtain a more holistic understanding of the importance and impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations for successful retail supply chain management by considering three different echelons in the supply chain. Three individual studies implementing various methodological approaches were conducted that considered the potential impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations at the supplier, the retailer, and the consumer level. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the three essays. The following research questions are addressed in this dissertation: 3  (1) How do retail omni-channel fulfillment operations impact retail firm performance? (2) How do retail omni-channel fulfillment operations impact the upstream supply chain? (3) How do retail omni-channel fulfillment operations impact consumer service perceptions?  Figure 1: Dissertation Overview Foundational Literature Review Retail Supply Chain Management Retail supply chain management research spans across a wide range of specific research areas, but predominantly focuses on investigating the potential impacts of operational improvements on retail supply chain performance (Mentzer et al. 2000). Over the last decade more retail research emerged focusing on the strategic importance of the retailer (Randall et al. 2011) and even consumers in retail supply chain management (e.g. Rao et al. 2014; Rao et al. 4  2011). Extant literature can be broadly categorized into three areas that address: forecasting, inventory management and the bullwhip effect, and retail operations. Forecasting Literature exploring forecasting in supply chain management can be segmented into three literature streams. The first stream focuses on how forecasting accuracy can be improved (e.g. Williams and Waller 2010; Williams and Waller 2011). For example, research in this stream suggests that suppliers may be able to improve their forecast accuracy by using Point-of-Sale data rather than using a retailer\\u2019s order history to develop forecasts (Williams and Waller 2010; Williams and Waller 2011). The second stream explores how forecasting impacts operational performance (e.g. Aviv 2007). For instance, it is suggested that suppliers and buyers can achieve significant supply chain performance improvements when implementing a collaborative forecasting approach in comparison to each echelon developing an individual forecast (e.g. Aviv 2001; Cachon and Lariviere 2001). The third stream of research integrates the importance of managerial decision making into forecasting accuracy (Carbone and Gorr 1985; Kremer et al. 2011). This body of work suggests that human judgment is an important factor that should be considered when developing forecasts. For example, Kremer et al. (2011) showed that managers are likely to overreact to forecast errors in stable environments leading to poorer forecasting performance.  Inventory Management and Bullwhip Effect Another body of literature within the area of retail supply chain management considers inventory management and the bullwhip effect. The bullwhip effect is the amplified variability in demand as one moves upstream in the supply chain (Lee et al. 1997). Within that literature, 5  research primarily focuses on exploring the impact of inaccurate inventory records (e.g. DeHoratius and Raman 2008; Kull et al. 2013) and the operational and behavioral causes of the bullwhip effect (e.g. Lee et al. 1997; Croson and Donohue 2006). In general, research has shown that inventory record inaccuracy leads to poor retail performance. Specifically, within a multi-channel retail setting, daily inventory record inaccuracy has been shown to increase inventory levels, while simultaneously decreasing service levels (Kull et al. 2013). Similarly, Nachtmann et al. (2010) found evidence for lower service levels stemming from inaccurate inventory records. Pertaining to the bullwhip effect, early research was specifically interested in exploring the operational causes that lead to the bullwhip effect (e.g. Sterman 1989; Lee et al. 1997). In addition to operational causes, behavioral causes, such as decision biases, have been of interest to retail supply chain management research. For example, Croson and Donohue (2006) found that managers constantly underweight the supply line (i.e. failure to account for past orders) inducing the bullwhip effect even after controlling for operational causes. However, some researchers failed to find evidence that the bullwhip effect  exists in retail supply chains (Cachon et al. 2007).  Retail Operations A last major topic in retail supply chain management considers retail operations and specifically focuses on on-shelf availability (OSA) (e.g. DeHoratius and Raman 2008; Waller et al. 2010; Ehrenthal and St\\u00f6lzle 2013). Within this research domain two streams can be identified. The first stream emphasizes the causes of poor OSA (e.g. Ehrenthal and St\\u00f6lzle 2013; Ettouzani et al. 2012) whereas the second stream focuses on consumer responses to out-of-stocks (Zinn and Liu 2001; Zinn and Liu 2008; Peinkofer et al. 2015). This research 6  suggests that poor OSA is primarily the result of operational inefficiencies within the supply chain (Corsten and Gruen 2003). Furthermore, while poor OSA leads to significant financial losses for retailers and suppliers, it also impacts consumers. The literature suggests that stockouts lead to consumer dissatisfaction and lowers repurchase intentions (Pizzi and Scarpi 2013; Kim and Lennon 2011). Fulfillment Operations Research pertaining to omni-channel fulfillment operations is still in its infancy and the majority of the available papers are either analytical in nature or adopt simulation techniques. This body of literature primarily focuses on investigating the linkages between fulfillment operations and the potential cost trade-offs firms may face when implementing omni-channel fulfillment operations (e.g. Bretthauer et al. 2010; Alptekino\\u011flu and Tang 2005).  While these important contributions should not be overlooked, the current focus of the extant research effectively ignores the impact that omni-channel fulfillment operations may have on supply chain members. Thus, it might be necessary to gain a holistic understanding of the potential impacts, changes, and challenges by considering different echelons of the supply chain. Within the realm of omni-channel retailing, operating and integrating multiple channels adds to a supply chain\\u2019s complexity but also provides members of a supply chain with new service opportunities and synergies (Verhoef et al. 2012). This is particularly relevant within the context of fulfillment operations. For example, some companies now offer consumers the ability to order products online and pick them up in the store, or request they be delivered to their home or place of employment. Given this change in the consumer environment, retailers will need to develop the capabilities required to fulfill consumer orders that are received and 7  satisfied simply from anywhere - whether it is from the store, the warehouse, or directly the supplier (Strang 2013).   One common theme found across the fulfillment literature pertains to the different strategies that multi-channel retailers use. Typically, retailers adding an additional  retail channel can either select to establish a separate fulfillment network or they can leverage their already existing  network (Bendoly 2004). In the latter case, retailers could use their stores to also fulfill online demand. However, research shows that retailers should carefully evaluate based on various factors, such as that the percentage of online sales (Bretthauer et al. 2010) for example, which stores to dedicate for simultaneous in store and online demand fulfillment since not all stores may be appropriate for online fulfillment operations (e.g. Bretthauer et al. 2010; Bendoly 2004; Mahar et al. 2014). Another possible option for retailers is to fulfill online demand using a distribution center. Insofar as distribution cost might differ for each of these options, Alptekino\\u011flu and Tang (2005) develop a model and demonstrate that it is typically more beneficial to fulfill online demand from the store when the distribution costs for both options similar. A second stream of research pertaining to fulfillment operations focuses on the impact of drop-shipping in online retailing. Drop-shipping is a fulfillment strategy where online orders are directly fulfilled by suppliers rather than drawing inventory from a retailer\\u2019s physical store or a distribution center (Cheong et al. 2015). One major challenge associated with this fulfillment option has to do with the potential discrepancies in inventory information between retailers and drop-shippers. Inventory record inaccuracies are a major driver of retail operation inefficiencies (Kull et al. 2013; DeHoratius and Raman 2008). However, research shows that 8  these challenges can be mitigated by commitment-penalty contracts (Gan et al. 2010) or by accounting for potential inventory errors (Cheong et al. 2015). Theoretical Background Essays one and two focus on the firm level; hence, an organizational theory is a suitable lens to inform these essays. Insofar as it is important for suppliers and retailers to refine their current fulfillment operations while simultaneously developing new fulfillment operations to adapt to the changing environment, the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity is deemed appropriate for these two studies. Essay three focuses on consumers more specifically and thus warrants a consumer level theory. Since equity theory has been widely used to study consumer behavior and perceptions in the context of service recovery (e.g. Roggeveen et al. 2012), equity theory is suitable to explore how omni-channel fulfillment operations impact consumer service perceptions.  Ambidexterity Rothaermel and Alexandre (2009, 759) define ambidexterity as \\u201can individual\\u2019s ability to use both hands with equal ease\\u201d. Applied to organizational management research, the ambidexterity concept has received interest from management scholars over the last decade (O\\u2019Reilly and Tushman 2013) and have given rise to a new research paradigm in the organizational theory literature (Raisch and Birkinshaw 2008). Research suggests that specifically within dynamic environments successful firms are understood to be ambidextrous (Junni et al. 2013) when they are capable of meeting current demand while at the same time being able to adapt to environmental (and subsequent demand) changes (Duncan 1976; Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004; Tushman and O\\u2019Reilly 1996).  9  The concept of ambidexterity has been examined across various disciplines and contexts, such as organizational learning (e.g. March 1991; Katila and Ahuja 2002), innovation (e.g. Tushman and O\\u2019Reilly 1996; He and Wong 2004), and most recently, operations management (e.g. Blome et al. 2013; Kristal et al. 2010). Ambidexterity originated in the organizational learning literature (March 1991) and implies that in order to be successful, firms should meet current business demands (exploitation) while simultaneously adapting to environmental changes (exploration) (Duncan 1976; Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004; Tushman and O\\u2019Reilly 1996). According to March (1991, 71) exploitation is defined as a firm\\u2019s activities that are characterized by, for example, refinement, efficiency, implementation, and execution, whereas exploitation is understood as a firm\\u2019s activities that include risk taking, experimentation, flexibility, discovery, and innovation to name a few.  While earlier research proposes that it is impossible for firms to achieve a simultaneous balance between exploitation and exploration (Hannan and Freeman 1977), March (1991) argues the contrary. March claims that it is of explicit necessity to a company\\u2019s survival that a balance between exploitation and exploration is maintained. Focusing on only one activity, either exploitation or exploration, may actually be to a company\\u2019s disadvantage. Literature suggests that companies solely focusing on exploitation may find themselves in a competency trap since these companies are unlikely to have the necessary capabilities in place to respond to environmental changes (Levitt and March 1988). Similarly, companies solely focusing on exploration may find themselves in a reiterative circle of search without any long-lasting outcomes (Levinthal and March 1993). Therefore the organizational research focus shifted from considering trade-offs between competing organizational activities, to adopting the 10  paradoxical view of aligning competing organizational activities simultaneously, thus giving rise to the concept of ambidexterity in management research (O\\u2019Reilly and Tushman 2013). Operations and supply chain scholars recognize ambidexterity as a potential solution to overcome the trade-offs between operational efficiency and adaptability (e.g. Kristal et al. 2010; Patel et al. 2012). Within the limited number of research manuscripts addressing ambidexterity three themes can be distinguished. First, some scholars use ambidexterity within the broader context of supply chain management (Kristal et al. 2010; Chandrasekaran et al. 2012). For example, Kristal et al. (2010) showed that firms having an ambidextrous supply chain strategy is helpful in developing supply chain capabilities and competencies leading to increased firm performance. A second theme considers ambidexterity at an operational level. Research suggest that operational ambidexterity is specifically important for companies operating under high uncertainty (Patel et al. 2012). While the first two themes consider ambidexterity within an individual firm, the third theme investigates the potential impact of ambidexterity when spanning firm boundaries. Research especially focused on how ambidextrous governance relates to firm performance (Blome et al.  2013; Chiu 2014). Findings suggest that within supply chain management, contractual and relational partnerships should be viewed as complementary rather than trade-offs (Blome et al. 2013).  Equity Theory Equity theory (Adams 1965) is an appropriate theoretical lens to study retail phenomena involving retailers and consumers. Equity theory states that in an exchange relationship, one party will experience a feeling of injustice if their ratio of outcomes to inputs is perceivably lower than their exchange partner\\u2019s ratio of outcomes to inputs. For example, if a retailer and its consumers are in an exchange relationship and the retailer is unable to provide 11  the consumers with the products they desire, consumers are likely to experience inequity and dissatisfaction (Oliver 1980) since they expected to be able to buy the product. However, equity can be restored by altering either the consumer\\u2019s inputs or outputs. For example, a retailer may offer customers a similar product (to the one they are out of), which in turn may increase the consumer\\u2019s output, thereby mitigating the feeling of injustice leading to consumer satisfaction (Roggeveen et al. 2012) and a positive attitude (Oliver 1980).   While equity theory originally only considered the dimension of distributive justice, more recently it has been conceptualized by three dimensions: distributive, procedural, and interactional justice. Distributive justice refers to an individual\\u2019s perception that the outcome of a process was fair (Adams 1965; Tax et al. 1998). Procedural justice refers to an individual\\u2019s perception of whether the process and policies that led to the outcome of process are were fair (Lind and Tyler 1988; Blodgett et al. 1997), and interactional justice refers to an individual\\u2019s perception of whether the interpersonal treatment during the process was fair (Tax et al. 1998).  Service recovery literature specifically draws on equity theory and conceptualizes equity as consisting of the three aforementioned dimensions. Extant research has shown that all three justice dimensions are important when attempting to restore consumer satisfaction after a service failure has occurred (e.g. Roggeveen et al. 2012). Additionally, supply chain management researchers have used equity theory to investigate supply chain failures (Rao et al. 2011; Griffis et al. 2012). Therefore, the use of equity theory to study how omni-channel fulfillment operations impact consumer service perceptions is appropriate.    12  Structure of the Dissertation Three individual essays with different methodological approaches were conducted to address the research questions outlined in the introduction. Essay one addresses the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations at the retailer level using secondary data. Essay two investigates the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations on upstream supply chain members. For this study a qualitative approach is used. Lastly, essay three focuses on the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations at the consumer level by implementing a series of experimental studies. Essay One Using the theoretical underpinning of ambidexterity, this essay explores how retailers manage and prioritize their investments and developments pertaining to exploratory and exploitative fulfillment operations and how those may lead to improvements in a retailer\\u2019s operational and financial performance. To address how omni-channel fulfillment operations are related to retail firm performance, a combination of secondary data of the retail industry are used. Using secondary data overcomes several shortcomings of other methods, for example survey methods, which are associated with common method and key informant bias (Roth 2007; Gattiker and Parente 2007). Data was collected from various secondary data sources. First, Compustat data was used to collect firm-level financial measures for publicly traded retailers. Second, press releases from the Lexis-Nexis database were used to collect data pertaining to a retailer\\u2019s announcement of fulfillment operations. This approach is in line with prior research 13  implementing a similar research approach (e.g. Hofer et al.  2012; Uotila et al. 2009; Tate et al. 2010).  The search within Lexis-Nexis is limited to the archives of the Business Wire and PR Newswire and all press releases referring to a retailer\\u2019s omni-channel fulfillment operations will be included in our analysis. Once all press releases were collected, the archival texts were analyzed using ATLAS.Ti to extract data to create our independent variables. Structural content analysis is an appropriate tool for quantitative content analysis (Tangpong 2011) and has been used in prior supply chain and operations research (e.g. Hofer et al. 2012). This approach is in line with previous research using press releases and structural content analyses to construct the independent variables of interest (Uotila et al. 2009).  Essay Two  A qualitative approach is suitable for exploration and theory building (Charmaz 2006). To explore how a retailer\\u2019s omni-channel fulfillment operations impact upstream supply chain members a qualitative research approach is employed using a case study design (Yin 2009). By starting the research process with examining the potential impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations on upstream supply chain members in depth, a solid understanding of the underlying assumptions and processes is achieved. Two case studies consisting of in-depth interviews and on-site visits were conducted. The emerging findings were triangulated with data from online news articles. This study explores the new role of suppliers within omni-channel retailing and how suppliers achieve operational ambidexterity. Interviews were professionally transcribed and analyzed using initial and focused coding procedures following Charmaz (2006). Adopting a qualitative research approach resulted in a solid theoretical model deeply grounded in the data (Charmaz 2006). 14  Essay Three The aim of this essay is to explore how omni-channel fulfillment operations can be used to recover from a stockout. This essay investigates how, in the case of a stockout, different attributes (e.g. convenience and speed) of omni-channel fulfillment operations may impact consumer satisfaction and their evaluation of a retailer\\u2019s physical distribution service quality (PDSQ). Using equity theory, a conceptual framework was developed and a series of experimental studies conducted to address the aforementioned research question. Experimental methods are used to isolate the causal effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable(s) of interest (Tokar 2010) and to test for potential mediators and moderators (Knemeyer and Naylor 2011). To ensure that only the variables of interest are manipulated and to rule out potential confounds, this method involves the careful development of experimental manipulations through extensive pretesting (Perdue and Summers 1986; Knemeyer and Naylor 2011). The first study manipulated two attributes related to omni-channel fulfillment: convenience, which refers to where a product is shipped to (i.e. the store or the consumer\\u2019s home) and speed, which accounts for when a product will be delivered (i.e. next day or in 9 days). Building on the first study, the second study specifically investigated the underlying theoretical mechanism, which may led to restoration of positive consumer perceptions after a stockout occurred. Study 3 introduced purchase criticality as an important contextual factor to investigate whether the relationships found in study 1 and study 2 holds in different consumer\\u2019s shopping context. Research on consumer responses to out-of-stocks has shown that it is important to consider whether a consumer feels he or she truly \\u201cneeds\\u201d a product or not, since this contextual factor might alternate the expected relationships (Zinn and Liu 2001).  15  Following prior experimental work in the supply chain management field (e.g. Esper et al. 2003), the series of experiments is based on a hypothetical shopping scenario where only the variables of interest vary between treatment groups. Careful development of the experimental shopping scenario, following the guidelines of Rungtusanatham et al. (2011), ensured the validity of the shopping scenario. Similarly, extensive pretesting ensured the validity of the experimental manipulations (Perdue and Summers 1986). The hypothetical shopping scenario asked participants to imagine themselves in a particular shopping situation and asked them to answer a short survey, wherein the responses served as the dependent variables of interest. For the pretest, a student sample was used. Students are an acceptable sample for experimental research in supply chain management research (Thomas 2011), insofar as students are also consumers (Kardes 1996). The final data wwre collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a national online consumer panel. MTurk has been deemed an acceptable source to recruit participants for experimental research (Knemeyer and Naylor 2011; Goodman et al. 2013).  Contributions and Implications  The current fulfillment operations literature primarily employs analytical models to investigate the impact of various fulfillment strategies on cost trade-offs. Consequently, the extant literature provides only limited insights into the impact of fulfillment operations and neglects the potential effects on other important retail supply chain performance measures. This dissertation overcomes these limitations by exploring the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations on three different echelons in the supply chain. Thus, this dissertation provides a holistic view of how omni-channel fulfillment operations affect retail operations and supply chain management, more generally. 16  Contributions and Implications of Essay One Essay one of this dissertation highlights the strategic importance of omni-channel fulfillment operations for retailers\\u2019 performance outcomes. Specifically, this research shows that retailers in the general merchandise and apparel segment achieve significant financial performance improvements due to operational ambidexterity. By focusing on the importance of developing ambidexterity in terms of fulfillment operations to achieve superior operational and financial performance outcomes, this dissertation explicates the impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations, beyond just a retailer\\u2019s cost structure. This is of particular interest, insofar as some companies fail to report any performance enhancements despite conducting omni-channel fulfillment operations (PwC 2015). Consequently, this research is able to explain why some companies experience superior performance outcomes due to omni-channel fulfillment operations and why others do not. Such insights might enable mangers to evaluate their own companies and equip them with better understanding as to why their companies might not reach expected performance outcomes. It also highlights the importance for managers to develop ambidextrous fulfillment operations to succeed in the changing and volatile retail environment. Moreover, by considering the impact of additional factors on the ambidexterity-performance relationship, this research explores boundary conditions and thus, also contributes to the theoretical understandings of ambidexterity. Considering resource endowment as a potential moderator, this research shows that large as well as small retailers might benefit from developing ambidextrous fulfillment operations. Managerially, the results inform mangers on whether, operational ambidexterity would be is a viable strategy to implement in order to achieve improved performance outcomes. 17  This research also contributes to the limited body of work on operational ambidexterity. Ambidexterity is an important concept, which overcomes trade-offs that managers might experience in the operations management field. Thus, this research provides further evidence of the positive relationship between operational ambidexterity and a firm\\u2019s operational and financial performance. In particular, this research uses longitudinal data providing further insights into the impact of operational ambidexterity over time to overcome the limitations of the current research, which relies heavily on cross-sectional data (e.g. Patel et al. 2012). Furthermore, by constructing an innovative data set and using a structured content analysis, this research specifically follows recent calls for more innovate research approaches (Boyer and Swink 2008) and the usage of content analyses for operations management research in particular (Tangpong 2011). Accordingly, essay one contributes to the general operations management literature by illustrating the suitability of this methodological approach for this discipline.  Contributions and Implications of Essay Two Essay two of this dissertation explores how suppliers become operationally ambidextrous. Specifically, considering drop-shipping as a new fulfillment option, suppliers might experience a disruption in their already established fulfillment operations, insofar as they now might also fulfill individual end-consumer orders. This research focuses on suppliers\\u2019 operational ambidexterity by providing a detailed description of how suppliers actually achieve operational ambidexterity within the context of drop-shipping. It is suggested that within the context of drop-shipping, there is a cyclical nature of exploitation and exploration. This is especially important considering that the literature lacks a clear understanding on how companies can achieve ambidexterity (e.g Adler et al. 1999; Siggelkow and Levinthal 2003). 18  Thus, this research advances the theoretical understandings of operational ambidexterity. This research also provides managers with insights on how to become operationally ambidextrous. Supply chain managers can use the findings of this study to benchmark them against their own company to investigate the factors needing adjustment in order to improve their operational ambidexterity. In addition, this research shifts the focus of drop-shipping research from a strategic perspective (the retailer) to a more tactical perspective (the supplier). In response, this research provides insight into the operational challenges (customizing, complying, and coordinating) and drivers (reacting, accepting, and penetrating) suppliers are facing within the current context of omni-channel retailing. Contributions and Implications of Essay Three Essay three spans the research areas of operations and marketing by investigating how omni-channel fulfillment operations can impact consumer perceptions. This research specifically contributes to the growing literature stream associated with consumer issues in supply chain management, which advocates the importance of operations management to create end-consumer value (Flint and Mentzer 2006). Specifically, this research highlights the importance of fulfillment operations for service recovery within an omni-channel retail environment. This research is important considering that in in an omni-channel retail environment fulfilment operations may play a new and important role in recovering from out-of-stocks and could help retailers \\u201csave the sale.\\u201d Additionally, this research contributes to the literature that investigates how consumers respond to out-of-stocks. Historically, this body of work has exclusively focused on exploring 19  consumer responses to out-of-stocks in a single channel setting (e.g. Zinn and Liu 2008; Pizzi and Scarpi 2013). However, with the emergence of omni-channel retailing, consumers have new options, in terms of their behavioral responses, when a stockout occurs. This research extends the current understandings of consumer responses to out-of-stocks by considering an omni-channel retail context. Furthermore, given the shift towards an omni-channel retail environment, wherein consumers have increased expectations and immediate switching capabilities (Brynjolfsson et al. 2013), it is essential for retail managers to understand consumer behavior and how consumers evaluate different fulfillment operations. This research highlights that a fast stockout recovery is essential for positive consumer perceptions. However, it is important to understand that not all recovery efforts will be evaluated by consumers equally. This research shows that the shopping context (purchase criticality) as an important effect on how consumers perceive different recovery attributes. Managers may wish to gain an understanding of the recovery attributes that are most valued by consumers to increase consumer satisfaction and repurchase intentions. This research considers the attributes of convenience and speed. These attributes are evaluated considering the situational involvement of the consumer in the shopping process and thus provide further insights for managers. This research shows that consumers evaluate the attributes differently based on their situational involvement. Thus, managers should adjust their recovery strategies according to consumer\\u2019s situational involvement to provide the most value and satisfaction to consumers. Dissertation Outline Following the introduction in chapter one, chapter two focuses on how omni-channel fulfillment operations are related to a retailer\\u2019s performance. Next, chapter three constitutes the 20  qualitative study, which explores operational ambidexterity within the drop-shipping context. Chapter four consists of a series of experiments that investigate how omni-channel fulfillment operations impact service recovery after a stockout has occurred. Lastly, chapter five will conclude this dissertation by summarizing the grand findings of this dissertation.  21  References  Adams, J.S. 1965. \\u201cInequity in Social Exchange.\\u201d Advances in Experimental Social Psychology 2: 267\\u201399.

Essay 1  The Impact of Operational Fulfillment Ambidexterity on Retail Firm Performance                        30  Introduction  In early 2013, Macy\\u2019s announced that it would be dedicating an additional 200 stores by the end of the year for the purpose of fulfilling online orders (Ryan 2014). Now, Macy\\u2019s is one of the leading retailers competing in the current retail landscape. By integrating their physical and electronic fulfillment operations (referred to as an omni-channel) (Brynjolfsson et al. 2013), Macy\\u2019s was able to gain more flexibility to efficiently and effectively fulfill consumer demand and address increasing consumer expectations. However, anecdotal evidence with regards to the effectiveness of omni-channels is mixed. While some retailers have reported performance improvements due to the implementation of omni-channel fulfillment operations (Forrester Research, Inc. 2014), others failed to report any performance enhancements whatsoever (PwC 2015). Because technological advancements are thought to disrupt and alter the traditional retail landscape (Brynjolfsson et al. 2013; Rigby 2011), it is pivotal to understand why some retailers might be able to succeed within this new omni-channel reality while others might not be able to thrive.  Macy\\u2019s standing as one of the leading retailers in the U.S. is largely due to its emphasis on improving existing fulfillment operations while simultaneously developing new fulfillment services, such as online ordering and in-store pickup options (Vishwanath and Mulvin 2001). In particular, when retailers fulfill online customer orders from physical stores, it allows the retailer to leverage pre-established fulfillment operations (Metters and Walton 2007), while simultaneously employing new fulfillment services for consumers. This anecdotal evidence suggests that retailers may need to develop \\u201cambidextrous\\u201d fulfillment operations to compete and survive within this new reality of omni-channel. Using the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity (e.g. Tushman and O\\u2019Reilly 1996; Raisch and Birkinshaw 2008), this study 31  investigates how retailers manage and prioritize their investments and developments with regards to their fulfillment operations and how that may lead to improvements in a retailer\\u2019s operational and financial performance.  Rothaermel and Alexandre (2009, 759) define ambidexterity as an \\u201cindividual\\u2019s ability to use both hands with equal ease\\u201d. In the organizational management literature, ambidexterity is used to describe the concept of balancing existing activities (exploitation) and new activities (exploration) (March 1991). Thus, the main premise of ambidexterity is that firms can achieve higher performance outcomes if they are able to balance activities pertaining to exploration and exploitation (March 1991). It is widely accepted within the management literature that firms will achieve higher performance outcomes if they are able to become \\u201cambidextrous\\u201d (Lubatkin 2006; He and Wong 2004; Junni et al. 2013). Similarly, the operations management literature suggests that firms that are able to exhibit ambidexterity in their operational activities might be able to achieve superior performance outcomes (Patel et al. 2012). Alternatively, those companies which fail to establish a balance between their exploration and exploitation activities, might not achieve optimal performance outcomes. A company that focuses exclusively on exploitation may lack the necessary capabilities to respond appropriately to changes in the environment (Levitt and March 1988). Correspondingly, a company that focuses exclusively on exploration may find itself in an reiterative circle of search leading to no performance enhancements (Levinthal and March 1993).  The majority of extant research exploring fulfillment operations uses analytical modeling to analyze the link between single and multi-channel fulfillment operations and estimate potential cost trade-offs (e.g. Bretthauer et al. 2010; Alptekino\\u011flu and Tang 2005). This body of research is limited insofar as it lacks an in-depth exploration of this linkage 32  between fulfillment operation and firm performance. Furthermore, a limited number of studies have developed empirical models to study the impact of fulfillment operations on operational (Randall, Netessine, and Rudi 2006) and financial performance (Xia and Zhang 2010). However, research exploring the link between a retailer\\u2019s fulfillment operations and its operational and financial performance within an omni-channel retail context is still lacking.  This research will make several contributions to the operations and supply chain management literature. First, it empirically explores the potential benefits of ambidextrous fulfillment operations within the U.S. retail industry. Prior research suggests that ambidexterity may be advantageous for firms to achieve higher performance outcomes, specifically within service industries (Junni et al. 2013). Furthermore, while the majority of operational ambidexterity research relies solely on survey data, this study uses a combination of data extracted from content analyses and financial information from Compustat to overcome the limitations of using survey data, such as common method and key informant bias (Roth 2007; Gattiker and Parente 2007). Research implementing quantitative content analyses is limited in the operations management discipline (Montabon et al. 2007), but remains an interesting and innovative approach to analysis, particularly in this field (Tangpong 2011). Thus, this research follows Boyer and Swink's (2008) call to employ diversified data sources in operations management research and specifically addresses Tangpong's (2011) suggestion to use content analysis tools for operations management research. The remainder of this manuscript will first provide an overview of the fulfillment operations literature. Next, the theoretical underpinnings and hypotheses will be presented following by an overview of the methodological approach and the results. The paper concludes with a discussion of the research findings and implications. 33  Literature Review   Consolidating physical and electronic retail channels in order to achieve a seamless retail environment carries some operational challenges, specifically in terms of order fulfillment, insofar as this act essentially necessitates a redesign of the retail supply chain. The physical retail environment is characterized by central warehouses and distribution centers that deliver products by the truck-load to respective retail stores, where end-consumer demand is fulfilled (Metters and Walton 2007). In the electronic retail environment, retailers take a different approach and end-consumer demand is directly fulfilled from a central warehouse location (Metters and Walton 2007). With the advancement of omni-channel retailing, however, online orders may be fulfilled either by a central warehouse or a dedicated store(s), hence combining the benefits of both approaches and fostering synergy effects across channels (Agatz et al. 2008). This is particularly advantageous for retailers, as their aim is ultimately to fulfill demand as efficiently as possible, be it by a store, distribution center, or manufacturer (Strang 2013). Nonetheless, this introduces new complexities to the retail supply chain and also impacts operations.  The more recent online fulfillment literature can be distinguished into two streams of research. The first stream focuses exclusively on online fulfillment operations (e.g. Rabinovich 2005; Netessine and Rudi 2006; Acimovic and Graves 2015). Internet retailers can fulfill end-consumer demand via their own inventory stocking locations, through an external supplier that directly fulfills end-consumer demand upon the retailer\\u2019s request (also known as drop-shipping), or by using a hybrid of these two strategies. The optimal fulfillment strategy for retailers depends on various external factors, such as drop-shipping mark-up, transportation costs (Netessine and Rudi 2006), market value, product popularity (Bailey and Rabinovich 34  2005), product variety, demand uncertainty, and firm age (Randall et al. 2006), to name a few. For example, retailers using drop-shipping may optimize their profits by dividing incoming orders based on high and low priority (Ayanso et al. 2006) and may achieve higher fulfillment performance due to emergency transshipments (Rabinovich 2005) or inventory consolidation (Rabinovich and Evers 2003). The second stream considers fulfillment operations within a multi-channel context (i.e. retailers that operate physical stores and have an online presence). Integrating physical and electronic channels allows retailers to offer new and different fulfillment services to end-consumers, such as online ordering and in-store pick up or return (Vishwanath and Mulvin 2001). Accordingly, these new services also require retailers to rework their fulfillment strategies. For example, retailers may need to evaluate whether online demand should be fulfilled from a distribution center or from retail stores. Research shows that a retailer can determine the optimal number of stores which handle online order fulfillment based on the percentage of online sales (Bretthauer et al. 2010). Thus, retailers can potentially decrease their costs by selecting only dedicated stores to offer new fulfillment services, such as online ordering and in-store pick up or return (Mahar et al. 2014). Still issues may occur; for example, fulfilling online demand from in-store inventory could lead to a lack of inventory availability in stores (Bendoly 2004) and hence retailers could potentially face a loss in sales.  As was previously mentioned, the majority of the literature investigating fulfillment operations employs analytical research methods and focuses on optimizing cost trade-offs for various fulfillment options. Research exploring the potential operational and financial benefits for retailers employing omni-channel fulfillment operations is still lacking. Xia and Zhang (2010) are among one of the first to empirically investigate the potential advantages of multi-35  channel retailers in comparison to traditional retailers. Their findings show that retailers operating multiple channels achieve superior operational and financial performance outcomes in comparison to single-channel retailers. However, their research focuses exclusively on comparing different types of retailers and does not consider the impact of different fulfillment operations, per se. In addition, their study only considers retailers operating up until 2008, which was before the majority of retailers developed omni-channel fulfillment operations. Further research has corroborated their findings (Forrester Research, Inc. 2014), while others have contradicted it, failing to report any performance improvements due to the implementation of omni-channel fulfillment operations (PwC 2015).  Given such limited, yet diversified and seemingly conflicting findings, a study that further investigates the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations on the performance of retail firms is undoubtedly warranted. In this way, this research contributes to the relevant literature stream by empirically examining the operational and financial effects retailers from three different retail segments (general merchandise, drug and food, and apparel) might experience when implementing omni-channel fulfillment operations.  Conceptual Framework and Hypotheses   Ambidexterity is a relatively recent theoretical view which has primarily been addressed by organizational research (Raisch and Birkinshaw 2008) but has, of late, also been used in the operations management discipline (e.g. Patel et al. 2012; Kristal et al. 2010). Ambidexterity originated in the organizational learning literature (March 1991) and implies that in order to be successful, firms should meet current business demands (exploitation) while simultaneously adapting to environmental changes (exploration) (Duncan 1976; Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004; Tushman and O\\u2019Reilly 1996).  36  According to March (1991, 71) exploitation is defined as a firm\\u2019s activities that are characterized by, for example, refinement, efficiency, implementation, and execution, whereas exploitation is understood as a firm\\u2019s activities that include risk taking, experimentation, flexibility, discovery, and innovation to name a few. Contrary to earlier research, which argued that firms cannot achieve alignment between their exploration and exploitation activities (Hannan and Freeman 1977), March (1991) suggests that firms that are able to create and foster such a balance and in so doing, will achieve greater performance outputs. Considered individually, exploitation is likely to lead to more short-term performance enhancements, whereas exploration is believed to impact long-term performance (March 1991). However, taken together a firm balancing exploratory and exploitative firm activities is likely to achieve short-term, as well as long-term performance outcomes, and hence, better performance outcomes over all. Based on the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity, I developed a model proposing that a retailer\\u2019s operational and financial performance is dependent on the balance it maintains between its exploratory and exploitative fulfillment operations. Furthermore, external factors, such as firm-specific characteristics (e.g. resource endowment) is believed to further amplify the relationship between ambidexterity and firm performance, which are thus accounted for in the theoretical model outlined in Figure 1. 37   Figure 2: Theoretical Model For this study, I build upon the exploration and exploitation constructs and define them within the context of retail fulfillment operations, where exploratory fulfillment operations are denoted by activities which aim to develop and establish new and innovative fulfillment options and exploitative fulfillment operations are denoted by activities that help to improve and refine pre-established fulfillment operations. Following Uotila et al. (2009), the balance between exploration and exploitation is readily apparent when looking specifically at a firm\\u2019s relative exploration activities. A low relative exploration indicates that retailers primarily focus on exploitative fulfillment operations whereas a high relative exploration is an indicator for retailers focusing primarily on exploratory fulfillment operations.  Successful omni-channel fulfillment operations are dependent on inventory management and inventory allocation in the supply chain (e.g. Bretthauer et al. 2010; Alptekino\\u011flu and Tang 2005). Following prior research, operational performance is defined as the extent to which a retailer is able to effectively manage its inventory (Alan et al. 2014; Gaur et al. 2005). Thus, for the purpose of this study operational performance refers to a firm\\u2019s inventory turnover, gross margin return on investment, and cash conversion cycle. Financial performance, as it is defined in the extant literature, is understood in terms of return based metrics, such as Return on Assets and Return on Investment (e.g. Carr 1999; Vickery et al. 38  2003), or market value based metrics, like Tobin\\u2019s Q (Jacobs et al. 2010; Uotila et al. 2009). In line with the previous research then, exploring the impact of ambidexterity on financial performance, i.e. market value, seems appropriate (Uotila et al. 2009), especially since market value has the advantage of capturing long-term and short-term performance effects (Lubatkin and Shrieves 1986; Allen 1993). Thus, for the purposes of this research, financial performance is defined as market value.  Exploratory and exploitative activities are fundamentally different in terms of their underlying structures, processes, and resources; this causes tension between exploratory and exploitative activities within a firm (He and Wong 2004). For example, firms face significant risks in terms of not achieving optimal performance outcomes when they exclusively emphasize one activity (e.g. exploration or exploitation) over the other. Firms focusing on exploitation might experience short-term performance benefits, however, they might fail to report positive long-term performance outputs, since these firms are not able to adapt to environmental changes (Uotila et al. 2009). As a result, these companies are likely to experience a competency trap since they lack the necessary capabilities to adjust and address changes in their environment (Levitt and March 1988). For example, Radio Shack announced bankruptcy in early 2015 after failing to adapt to changes in the retail sector due to the emergence of the Internet (Ruiz and De La Merced 2015). Radio Shack is thus an example of a retailer that focused on exploiting its pre-existing fulfillment operations in its physical stores, without taking into account changes in the online retail environment. As a result, they were not able to sustain future activities and were forced to declare bankruptcy.  Alternatively, retailers focusing exclusively on exploratory activities might find themselves exposed to the risk of  a reiterative circle of searching for and developing new 39  fulfillment operations (Levinthal and March 1993) with highly variable and often volatile long-term benefits (Uotila et al. 2009). Since these retailers\\u2019 pre-existing competencies and capabilities are not continuously refined or improved in a timely manner, they miss out on realizing many short-term benefits (March 1991). For instance Amazon, a retailer known for its innovativeness always exploring new fulfillment activities, reported positive profits for the very first time eight years after the company was founded (Stone 2013). In sum, based on the premises of ambidexterity, firms concentrating on either exploitative or exploratory activities, but not both, will experience less than optimal performance outcomes (March 1991). Consequently, rather than focusing on trade-offs between exploration and exploitation, research shows that companies should become ambidextrous to achieve superior firm performance. The tenets of ambidexterity calls for retailers to establish a balance between refining their pre-existing fulfillment operations and discovering new fulfillment operations (e.g. offering online orders and in-store pick up) in order to achieve superior operational and financial performance outcomes. Prior research has demonstrated that firms can achieve higher performance outcomes if they are able to balance their exploitative and exploratory activities (He and Wong 2004; Junni et al. 2013; Cao et al. 2009). The literature situated in the operations management realm has corroborated this claim, evidencing the importance of ambidextrous operations in order to achieve better performance outcomes (Patel et al. 2012). Thus, an inverted U-shape relationship is hypothesized: H1: A retailer\\u2019s relative exploration exhibits a curvilinear relationship on the retailer\\u2019s financial performance such that retailers focusing predominantly on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities will exhibit lower Tobin\\u2019s Q than retailers balancing exploitative and exploratory (medium relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. H2: A retailer\\u2019s relative exploration exhibits a curvilinear relationship on the retailer\\u2019s operational performance such that: 40  H2a: Retailers focusing predominantly on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities will exhibit lower Inventory Turns than retailers balancing exploitative and exploratory (medium relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. H2b: Retailers focusing predominantly on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities will exhibit lower GMROI than retailers balancing exploitative and exploratory (medium relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. H2c: Retailers focusing predominantly on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities will exhibit higher Cash Conversion Cycles than retailers balancing exploitative and exploratory (medium relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities.  Based on our discussion above, retailers concentrating on exploitative or exploratory activities face the risk of either achieving only short-term benefits or only long-term benefits leading to less than optimal performance outcomes overall (March 1991). Literature suggests that the ambidexterity-performance relationship might also depend on firm-specific factors, such as resource endowment, which refers to a firm\\u2019s availability of resources (Raisch and Birkinshaw 2008). According to the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity, exploratory and exploitative activities stand in competition for a firm\\u2019s available resources (March 1991), as firms face the challenge of deciding which activities to allocate their available resource to.  The management and allocation of available resources within a firm depends on the firm\\u2019s organizational structure (Moch 1976). Thus, the success of balancing exploratory and exploitative fulfillment operations will depend to the extent that a retailer is able to manage and allocate its resources accordingly. In general, large firms can be characterized by having a complex hierarchical structure impeding the resource allocation within the organization (Blau 1968). Contrary, small firms lacking a complex structural hierarchy are able to allocate resources fairly easy across the organization to various business activities (Moch 1976). Thus, specifically large firms might experience difficulty in managing and attaining their resource 41  allocating in a balance of exploratory and exploitative business activities. However, for small firms lacking a complex organizational structure it can be easier to cope with the management and allocation of resources making the achievement and attainment of a balance between exploitation and exploration more beneficial. Prior research has shown that smaller firms with limited resource availability benefit most by focusing on achieving a balance between exploitation and exploration (Cao et al. 2009). Therefore, I hypothesize: H3: Resource endowment moderates the relationship between a retailer\\u2019s relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its financial performance such that the relationship between a retailer\\u2019s relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its Tobin\\u2019s Q is negatively moderated by resource endowment. H4: Resource endowment moderates the relationship between a retailer\\u2019s relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its operational performance such that: H4a: Resource endowment negatively moderates the relationship between a retailer\\u2019s relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its Inventory Turn. H4b: Resource endowment negatively moderates the relationship between a retailer\\u2019s relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its GMROI. H4c: Resource endowment positively moderates the relationship between a retailer\\u2019s relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its Cash Conversion Cycle.  Methodology  Data The data for this study are compiled from two different data sources. Firm-level financial data were collected from Compustat and firm-level data pertaining to a retailer\\u2019s omni-channel fulfillment operations were collected from electronic press releases from the Lexis-Nexis database. This approach is in line with other research using secondary data to investigate the ambidexterity-performance relationship (e.g. Uotila et al. 2009). Furthermore, 42  scholars have called for more research employing longitudinal data sets to explore the impact of ambidexterity on firm performance as a way to gain a better understanding of the effects over time (Kristal et al. 2010; Patel et al. 2012).  While most retailers introduced omni-channel fulfillment operations after 2010, leading omni-channel retailers, such as Macy\\u2019s and Walmart, began as early as 2007/2008. To ensure these earlier press releases are taken into account, the longitudinal data were collected starting from 2004 until 2014, spanning a ten year period. This time period has been selected to ensure that sufficient data are available pertaining to retailer omni-channel fulfillment operations, insofar as it is a fairly recent phenomenon.  Sample Following prior research (Alan et al. 2014; Gaur et al. 2005), the selection of retail firms was based on the four-digit Standard Industry Classification (SIC) codes that the U.S. Bureau of Commerce assigns to each company within industry segments. The sample includes 164 publicly traded retailers from 12 different retail industry segments, which is in line with previous research focusing on the context of the retail industry (Gaur, Fisher, and Raman 2005). Based on the SIC codes and similarity in terms of products sold by the retailers, we created three SIC groups. SIC group 1 consolidates general merchandise stores, SIC group 2 food and drug stores, and SIC group 3 apparel retailers. Table 1 summarizes the retail industry segments and their respective SIC codes. A total of 25 retailers was removed from the sample due to not having at least four consecutive yearly observations between 2004 and 2014 or being international retailers. The final sample consists of 39 U.S. retailers in SIC group 1, 44 U.S. retailers in SIC group 2, and 56 U.S. retailers in SIC group 3. The overall sample has a total of 1289 firm level observations.   43  Firms operating in highly dynamic and competitive environments are more prone to become ambidextrous than firms operating in less dynamic and competitive environments (Raisch and Birkinshaw 2008). SIC groups 1 through 3 represent different subgroups of retailers facing unique environmental conditions within their respective retail segments. For example, SIC group 2 (food and drug stores) is associated with a less dynamic and competitive retail environment in comparison to SIC group 1 (general merchandise stores) and 3 (apparel) (Mazzone & Associates, Inc. 2015). Hence, one would expect that the predicted relationships might depend on the retail segment that retailers are operating in and thus, I subsequently test the hypotheses for each individual SIC group to control for the unique environmental settings each retail segment is facing and to gain more nuanced insights. Table 1: Retail Industry Segments with SIC Codes SIC group SIC codes Industry segment Retail Example 1 5311 Department Stores Macy's 5331 Variety Stores Walmart 5731 Radio, TV, Consumer Electronics Stores Best Buy 5945 Hobby, Toy, and Game Shops Toys R Us 5700 Home furniture and Equipment Stores Bed Bath and Beyond 2 5400; 5411 Food Stores Kroger 5912 Drug and Proprietary Stores Walgreens 3 5600-5699 Apparel and Accessory Stores Gap Inc.  Content analysis  This research employed a structured content analysis of press releases concerning U.S. retailers as a way to capture activities pertaining to omni-channel fulfillment operations. The extant operations and supply chain management research that employs structured content 44  analyses is limited, but such a method may prove particularly useful in extracting and analyzing data from archival documents, such as press releases or company reports (Tangpong 2011). For example, this method has been used by operation and supply chain scholars to explore firms\\u2019 social responsibility (Tate et al. 2010) and environmental management activities (Montabon et al. 2007; Hofer et al. 2012). Thus, this research approach is in line with other studies implementing structured content analysis. The press releases were collected from the Lexis-Nexis database and I limited the search within the database to the archives of Business Wire and PR Newswire. Only those press releases that contained the name of the retailer in the headline and discussed a retailer\\u2019s fulfillment operations were inlcuded. Once all press releases were collected, duplicates were removed and the word frequency for exploratory and exploitative words using Atlas.Ti was extracted. With the availability of content analysis software, manual coding has been widely replaced by automated computer coding. Research shows that there is no significant difference in the accuracy between automated and human coding (King and Lowe 2003), thus automated coding is a feasible alternative to human coding procedures (Neuendorfer 2002) and is used for the purpose of this research.  This methodological approach is in line with Uotila et al. (2009) who developed a methodology to assess a firm\\u2019s ambidexterity based on secondary data and frequency word counts. I extended Uotila et al.\\u2019s (2009) methodological approach by tailoring the operational definition of exploration and exploitation to a supply chain and operations management context. Uotila et al. (2009) used the rather general definition for exploration and exploration following March (1991). March (1991) refers to exploration as terms such as \\u201csearch, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, innovation\\u201d and 45  exploitation as terms such as \\u201crefinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, execution.\\u201d  To extend and adjust the operational definition of exploitation and exploration to a supply chain and operations management context, I developed a list containing synonyms of the proposed terms by March (1991) from three different online dictionaries (Theasaurus.com, oxforddictionaires.com, and Merriam-webster.com). Any word duplicates were removed leaving a list of 384 potential synonyms. Two independent coders were selected to evaluate each of the word, determining whether they should be included as a synonym within the context of supply chain and operations management or not. The coders were provided a detailed description for the coding process. The percent agreement between the two independent coders was 80.7%. Any discrepancies between the two coders were resolved by the primary researcher. A total of 40 additional synonyms representing the supply chain and operations management context were included to operationalize exploration and exploitation. Table 2 summarizes the word roots which were used in this research.

(2009), the main variable of interest is a retailer\\u2019s relative amount of exploratory versus exploitative omni-channel fulfillment activities that can be observed at the firm-level. The relative amount of exploration versus exploitation was calculated for each retailer (by year) by dividing the number of word occurrences that relate to exploratory activities by the sum of exploratory and exploitative words. This approach was used previously by Uotila et al. (2009) to measure companies\\u2019 ambidexterity based on data  from a structured content analysis;  Resource Endowment  Following prior literature, firm size is an effective proxy from which to measure a firm\\u2019s resource availability (Cao et al. 2009; Lin et al. 2007), since large firms often have higher resource availability than small firms (Chen and Hambrick 1995; Boyer et al. 1996). Firm size has been operationalized in various ways, but is most commonly done so in terms of the number of employees a firm has, i.e. its human resources (e.g. Cao et al. 2009; Koufteros et al. 2007) or with regards to a firm\\u2019s sales in dollars (e.g. Hofer et al. 2012) or assets (e.g. Lin et al. 2007; Eroglu and Hofer 2011) which refers to its physical resource availability. In the context of this research, a firm\\u2019s physical resources are most appropriate to study the ambidexterity-performance relationship. Since this research focuses on omni-channel fulfillment operations, resources for day-to-day operations (current assets) as well as fixed physical resources (fixed assets) are expected to play an important role for retailers developing ambidextrous fulfillment operations. Thus, in line with previous operations management 47  research, firm size will be measured in terms of a retailer\\u2019s total assets (e.g. Eroglu and Hofer 2011).  Dependent Variables Operational and Financial Performance  For retailers, inventory management is one of the key operational activities. Retailers strive to reduce their optimal inventory levels to enhance their overall competitiveness and performance. Since omni-channel fulfillment operations are directly related to a restructuring of inventory allocation and management in the retail supply chain, inventory effectiveness is an appropriate operational outcome to explore. Prior research has primarily focused on inventory productivity (e.g. Chen et al. 2007; Huson 1995; Gaur et al. 2005; Alan et al. 2014) and several different measures have been proposed, such as inventory turnover or gross margin return on inventory (GMROI) (Alan et al. 2014). Following Alan et al. (2014), I will focus on inventory turnover and GMROI as our inventory productivity measures. In addition, I focus on the cash conversion cycle as an additional important operational outcome variable (e.g. Hendricks et al. 2009) since it reflects how fast a company can turn its resource investments into cash. The three measures were calculated as follows: (i) Inventory Turnover (IT) \\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc47\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 =\\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc3a\\ud835\\udc46\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 \\u2212 \\ud835\\udc3f\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc39\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 + \\ud835\\udc3f\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc39\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc56,\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc49\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 + \\ud835\\udc3f\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc39\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 (ii) GMROI \\ud835\\udc3a\\ud835\\udc40\\ud835\\udc45\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 =\\ud835\\udc46\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 \\u2212 \\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc3a\\ud835\\udc46\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 + \\ud835\\udc3f\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc39\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc56,\\ud835\\udc61 \\u2212 \\ud835\\udc3f\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc39\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc56,\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc49\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 + \\ud835\\udc3f\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc39\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 48  (iii) Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) \\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 = \\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc60 \\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc63\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc66 \\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc54\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 +  \\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc60 \\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc60 \\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc54\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61\\u2212 \\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc60 \\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc4f\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc52 \\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc54\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 Prior research has highlighted the important linkage between a firm\\u2019s operational and financial performance (e.g. Hendricks and Singhal 2005; Hendricks and Singhal 2009; Alan, et al. 2014). Accordingly, this study also pays particular attention to a retailer\\u2019s financial performance. In line with previous research, market value serves as an appropriate outcome variable (Uotila et al. 2009). Market value has been operationalized in the operations management literature as Tobin\\u2019s Q (e.g. Setia and Patel 2013; Modi and Mishra 2011) and has the advantage of capturing long-term and short-term performance results (Lubatkin and Shrieves 1986; Allen 1993). Tobin\\u2019s Q (TQ) is calculated as follows: (\\ud835\\udc56) \\ud835\\udc47\\ud835\\udc44\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 =\\ud835\\udc40\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc58\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc61 \\ud835\\udc63\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc52 \\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc53 \\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc35\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc58 \\ud835\\udc63\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc52 \\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc53 \\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc60 Since the data set spans a time period of 10 years, a dummy variable to account for the economic recession occurring in late 2008 was included. Year 2004 through 2008 are coded as 0 and years 2009 through 2014 are coded as 1. Hence, the year dummy is capturing the potential impact the economic recession of 2008 might have had on retailers\\u2019 financial and operational performance.

Based on the characteristics of the data set, a two-step dynamic GMM estimator was applied using xtabond2 in STATA (Roodman 2009). The data set is unbalanced and has missing values. The GMM estimator accounts for missing values by using orthogonality conditions and hence, exploits all the information that is potentially available in the data set using internal instrument (Roodman 2009). Since the number of instruments is quartic in the time period, I controlled for the number of instruments used in the model by employing the collapse demand in STATA. The dynamic GMM model is an appropriate estimator for a dynamic model with a large number of cross-section units (N=131 retailers) and a small time period (T=11 years). Furthermore, the explanatory variables cannot be assumed to be strictly exogenous and hence, one must account for potential endogeneity. The difference GMM estimator allows to estimate models with predetermined and/or endogenous explanatory variables.  50  The year dummy and log transformed total assets were treated as strictly exogenous variables. The lag of the dependent variables entered the model as endogenous variables, and following Uotila et al. (2009) relative exploration was treated as a predetermined variable. For each of the four dependent variables I estimated three models: Model 1 is the base model including the control variables, model 2 includes the main effect variables and tests Hypotheses 1 and 2, and model 3 includes the interaction terms to test Hypothesis 3 and 4.  For SIC group 1 (general merchandise stores) there is a significant curvilinear relationship between relative exploration and Tobin\\u2019s Q. The result indicates that retailers in this segment who are able to balance exploitative and exploratory fulfillment operational activities (medium relative exploration) exhibit higher Tobin\\u2019s Q than retailers who focus predominately on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. Hence, H1 is supported for SIC group 1. However, resource endowment does not function as a moderator of the relationship between relative exploration and retailers\\u2019 financial performance, leading to rejecting H3 for SIC group 1. Furthermore, for the remaining dependent variables (IT, GMROI, and CCC) no significant effect of a retailer\\u2019s relative exploration was detected suggesting that retailers in SIC group 1 do not gain operational efficiencies due to becoming more ambidextrous in terms of their fulfillment operations. We reject H2a, H2b, and H2c for SIC group 1. Moreover, resource endowment does not moderate the relationship between a retailer\\u2019s relative exploration and its operational performance. Therefore, H4a, H4b, and H4c are rejected. Error!

When the interaction terms are added to the model the results indicate that there is a significant curvilinear relationship between relative exploration and Tobin\\u2019s Q depending on resource endowment. Based on theory a relationship resembling an inverted U-shape was predicted, however, the results indicate that for Tobin\\u2019s Q the relationship follows the pattern of a U-shape. Hence, the results suggest that retailers in the SIC group 2 achieve higher financial performance outcomes in terms of Tobin\\u2019s Q if they either focus on exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities rather than balancing exploitative and exploratory fulfillment operational activities (medium relative exploration) and this effect is even stronger for retailers with smaller resource endowment than for retailers with lower resource endowment. Thus, H3 is also rejected. For operational performance there is no effect of relative exploration on inventory turnover and also the interaction is not significant leading to the rejection of H2a and H4a for SIC group 1. While I do not observe a significant direct effect of a retailer\\u2019s relative exploration on GMROI, I do observe a significant interaction term. For GMROI, the signs of the coefficients are in line with the predictions indicating an inverted U-shape which depends on resource endowment. The sign of the interaction terms suggest that the inverted U-shape is even more prone for retailers with small resource endowment than retailers with large resource endowment which is in line with the predictions. Thus, H2b is rejected but H4b for SIC group 2 is accepted.  For the cash conversion cycle the results indicate that retailers who are able to balance exploitative and exploratory fulfillment operational activities (medium relative exploration) 54  achieve lower cash conversion cycles than retailers who focus predominately on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. Thus, there is support for H2b for SIC group 2.  Also, the interaction term is significant and the sign of the coefficient is in line with the predictions indicating that retailers with smaller resource endowment achieve better cash conversion cycles than retailers with high resource endowment. Therefore, H4c for SIC group 2 is accepted.

Hence, in the apparel retail segment retailers who are able to balance exploitative and exploratory fulfillment operational activities (medium relative exploration) achieve higher financial performance than retailers who focus predominately on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. However, the interaction term was not significant and hence H3is rejected for SIC group 3.  For operational performance there is no direct effect of relative exploration on Inventory Turnover. Thus, H2a for SIC group 3 is rejected. However, the interaction term for Inventory Turnover is significant and, in line with the predictions, negative. This result suggests that retailers who are able to balance exploitative and exploratory fulfillment operational activities (medium relative exploration) achieve higher inventory turnover rates than retailers who focus predominately on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities especially for retailers who have small resource endowment. Thus, H4a is accepted for SIC group 3. Also, there is no significant direct or interaction term for the Cash Conversion Cycle leading to the rejection of H2c and H4c for SIC group 3. For GMROI I observe a significant curvilinear relationship between a retailer\\u2019s relative exploration and its GMROI in line with the predictions and hence, supporting H2b for SIC group 3. The results indicate that retailers who are able to balance exploitative and exploratory fulfillment operational activities (medium relative exploration) achieve higher GMROI than retailers who focus predominately on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. Resource endowment does not moderate the relationship and thus, H4b is rejected for SIC 58  group 3.

This is specifically the case for general merchandise (SIC group 1) and apparel (SIC group 3) retailers operating in highly dynamic and competitive retail segments. It is suggested that retailers who are becoming ambidextrous in terms of their fulfillment operations are able to harvest short-term as well as potential long-term financial benefits. Hence, these retailers are likely to gain a financial advantage over other retailers focusing on either exploitation or exploration despite increasing fulfillment costs. Based on the empirical evidence, food and drug stores (SIC group 1) do not seem to benefit financially from being ambidextrous in terms of their fulfillment operations. The food 61  and drug retail segment can be characterized as being  relatively mature and stable (Mazzone & Associates, Inc. 2015). Since the reason for a firm to pursue explorative activities is to adapt to changes in the environment, firms operating in stable environments might not need to invest in explorative activities and achieve a balance between exploitative and exploratory activities. Prior research suggests that achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation is specifically important for firms operating in highly dynamic environments and does not have a significant performance impact for firms operating in stable environments (Zahra and George 2002).  In addition to exploring the linkage of operational ambidexterity and financial performance, I also examined the potential impacts on a retailer\\u2019s operational performance. While the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity and its impact on a firm\\u2019s financial performance have received support in prior research (e.g. He and Wong 2004; Uotila et al. 2009), extending it to a firm\\u2019s operational performance is rather new. A retailer\\u2019s ambidexterity in terms of omni-channel fulfillment operations did not lead to enhancement in terms of inventory turns. This was a consistent finding across all three SIC groups and anecdotal evidence might explain the lack of support. Retailers investing into omni-channel fulfillment operations frequently report operational inefficiencies due to exploring new fulfillment opportunities while exploiting already established ones (Aptos, Inc. 2016). For example, until recently American Eagle operated separate distribution centers for its in-store and online fulfillment services which increased its operational expenses (Guillot 2016). Since the emergence of the omni-channel retail environment is a rather recent phenomenon and retailers are still struggling to adjust to the operational challenges, the data might have captured a time period which is characterized by operational inefficiencies.  62  However, I do observe that apparel retailers (SIC group 3) who are becoming operationally ambidextrous in terms of their fulfillment activities achieve a higher GMROI than apparel retailers focusing on either exploitation or exploration. Thus, operationally ambidextrous apparel retailers have a greater ability to turn their respective inventory into cash which might also be due to generally higher margins (Mazzone & Associates, Inc. 2015) and the notion that 18% of each sale has been shown to come from satisfying consumers\\u2019 omni-channel expectations (Aptos, Inc. 2016). Moreover, the insights from the results pertaining to the potential moderating effect of firm size are more nuanced. Based on the theoretical underpinnings we expected small retailers to be better at managing and allocating their available resources due to the lack of a complex organizational structure (Moch 1976) and hence, to be better attain the balance between exploratory and exploitative fulfillment operations. In line with the predictions, the results illustrate that resource endowment plays an important role in the context of omni-channel retailing specifically when focusing on operational performance outcomes. For example, while there is lack of evidence of operational ambidexterity impacting performance outcomes for SIC group 2 overall, the results show that the effect is contingent on retailer size. Hence, although larger retailers might have more resources available, in line with prior research (Cao et al. 2009) I found evidence that smaller retailers benefit more from achieving and attaining a balance between exploitative and exploratory activities which might be due to their ability to easier cope with their resource allocation and management.   63  Theoretical Contributions  By employing a relatively novel data collection and generation approach I was able to provide more nuanced insights into the phenomenon under study. Ambidexterity has only recently been addressed in the operations management literature. The limited number of studies use survey data providing only subjective insights from key informants at one specific point in time. To overcome these limitations, I followed the call for research implementing content analysis (Tangpong 2011) and using a variety of different data sources (K. Boyer and Swink 2008) for operations management studies. By combining the ambidexterity data extracted from press releases and actual financial and operational measures from Compustat, I provided objective measures for the ambidexterity-performance relationship. This approach led to a longitudinal data set which allowed me to investigate the phenomenon over time overcoming the limitations of using survey data (Kristal et al. 2010; Patel et al. 2012). In addition, I am building on the methodological approach of Uotila et al. (2009) who defined exploitation and exploration in a broad business context following the original definitions from March (1991). I recognized this as a limitation and systematically adjusted the definitions for exploitation and exploration to a supply chain and operations management context. Hence, I extended the vague and rather broadly held theoretically definitions of exploitation and exploration to the operations management context.  Furthermore, by considering three sub segments of retailers in this study, I was able to provide more nuanced insights for the importance of the environmental context when examining the impact of operational ambidexterity on performance. The environmental circumstances seem to play an important role for our understanding of why some retailers are able to achieve performance enhancements due to balancing exploratory and exploitative 64  fulfillment operations while others may not. Hence, this study highlights the environmental context as an important boundary condition for the ambidexterity-performance relationship. Lastly, the premises of ambidexterity might provide a theoretical explanation for the reporting of mixed performance outcomes of retailers operating in an omni-channel retail environment (PwC 2015). Based on this research, retailers failing to report any performance enhancements due to developing omni-channel fulfillment operations might solely focus on exploring new fulfillment operations rather than striving for a balance between exploiting their already established fulfillment operations while simultaneously developing new fulfillment operations. Hence, this research furthers our understanding of the ambidexterity-performance relationship for retail supply chain management research.  Managerial Implications  While the development of omni-channel fulfillment operations is still growing, it is slowly becoming the norm. Based on a recent survey, for 80% of retailers omni-channel fulfillment operations are either not profitable or they are not aware of it (Aptos, Inc. 2016). I provide evidence to managers that specifically within the general merchandise and apparel retail segment the investment in omni-channel fulfillment operations improves a retailer\\u2019s profitability. Hence, specifically retailers operating in highly dynamic and competitive retail segments might benefit financially from establishing omni-channel fulfillment operations.   However, managers should also be aware of the potential operational inefficiencies they might face especially at the beginning of investing in omni-channel fulfillment operations. As the results indicate, retailers in the apparel segment who have invested in developing omni-channel fulfillment operations for probably the longest period of time are just seeing now at 65  least some positive impacts on their operational performance. Thus, while retailers developing omni-channel fulfillment operations might achieve financial improvements rather in a short-term, the potential operational improvements might only be achieved after a longer period of time.  Furthermore, it is suggested that large retailers as well as small retailers seem to benefit from investing into omni-channel fulfillment operations. While small retailers might not have as many resources available as large retailers do, the former might benefit most from achieving a balance between exploiting already established and exploring new fulfillment operations rather than focusing on either exploration or exploitation. Larger retailers, however, have the advantage of being able to draw upon their available pool of slack resources (Chen and Hambrick 1995) and maintain periods of focusing on either exploration or exploitation. Thus, specifically managers of smaller retailers that currently focus on either exploitation or exploration should allocate their limited resources accordingly and try to achieve a balance between these both activities.  Future Research The contextual setting selected for this research is quite unique. The data set represents a time period (2004-2014) where omni-channel retailing just started to emerge and grow over the last couple of years. The selected time period is characterized by retailers suffering from operational inefficiencies due to developing omni-channel fulfillment operations (Aptos, Inc. 2016). Once omni-channel becomes more mature, retailers might actually be able to gain operational efficiencies. Therefore, future research should extend this study to a later point in time when omni-channel retailing will be more mature. A replication of the current study 66  would provide further insights on the linkage between operational ambidexterity and financial and operational performance at different life cycle stages of omni-channel retailing. Furthermore, the sample is constrained to publicly traded retailers in the U.S. and hence, the predictions are limited in terms of generalizability. Thus, future research endeavors could extend this research to other geographical regions. Each country has a unique retail landscape, and being able to contrast the operational ambidexterity performance relationship across different countries might provide more nuanced insights. Also, future research might consider exploring online retailers and the extent to which these retailers develop ambidextrous fulfillment operations within an omni-channel retail environment. This kind of research might provide us with a better understanding of the operational ambidexterity-performance relationship within another unique retail context. However, the linkage between operational ambidexterity and performance does not have to be solely investigated within the retail industry. Extending this research to other industries might provide further interesting insights.  Lastly, future research might also want to explore additional boundary conditions. The rapid developments in technology (Brynjolfsson et al. 2013; Rigby 2011) provide retailers with new and innovative technological options, which have the potential to enhance the performance of their omni-channel fulfillment operations (Anderson and Lee 2000). Operations and supply chain managers suggest that enabling inventory visibility across retail channels is important in facilitating successful omni-channel fulfillment operations (Strang 2013). 48% of retail managers perceive inventory visibility as a major inhibitor for successful omni-channel fulfillment operation (Aptos, Inc. 2016). Thus, exploring the potential moderating effect of inventory visibility might be an important consideration for future research.  67  References  Acimovic, J., and Graves, S.C. 2015. \\u201cMaking Better Fulfillment Decisions on the Fly in an Online Retail Environment.\\u201d Manufacturing & Service Operations Management 17 (1): 34\\u201351.

Essay 2  Assessing the Impact of Retail Omni-Channel Fulfillment Operations on the Upstream Supply Chain                        75  Introduction  The development of omni-channel fulfillment operations has led to the emergence of new operational complexities in the retail supply chain. Managers are now faced with the challenge of developing new ways to efficiently and effectively manage omni-channel operations to meet consumer expectations and achieve a competitive advantage (Brynjolfsson et al. 2013; Strang 2013). It has been suggested that in order for retailers to be successful, they should develop the necessary capabilities to fulfill consumer demand from anywhere \\u2013 the store, the distribution center, and/or directly from suppliers (Strang 2013). While the role of retailers, as it pertains to fulfillment operations, has received a lot of attention in the literature (e.g. Randall et al. 2006), research investigating suppliers and their operational capabilities for successful demand fulfillment within this new reality is lacking. Specifically, considering the recent emergence of drop-shipping as a viable fulfillment option in the omni-channel retail environment suggest that suppliers will experience significant changes to their fulfillment operations which warrants further research. Drop-shipping, also known as consumer direct fulfillment, refers to a fulfillment strategy where end-consumer orders are fulfilled directly from suppliers upon a retailer\\u2019s request (Cheong et al. 2015). While this fulfillment strategy has been predominantly used in online retailing (e.g. Randall et al. 2006; Netessine and Rudi 2006), it can also be successfully implement in an omni-channel retail environment. Contrary to traditional retail supply chain management, suppliers may now engage  directly with end-consumers, directly fulfilling end-consumer demand in the name of a retailer (Agatz et al. 2008).  As a result, suppliers are likely to experience a disruption in their current fulfillment operations and might develop new fulfillment capabilities while refining pre-established ones 76  in order to succeed within the new reality of omni-channel retailing. This suggests that suppliers may need to become \\u201cambidextrous\\u201d in terms of their fulfillment operations in order to adapt to the changes in the retail environment. This is particularly important when considering the fact that suppliers might not only fulfill pallet size retail orders but simultaneously may also develop the necessary capabilities to fulfill individual consumer orders (Agatz et al. 2008).  Ambidexterity is simply defined as an \\u201cindividual\\u2019s ability to use both hands with equal ease\\u201d (Rothaermel and Alexandre 2009, 759). Within a business context, prior research defines ambidexterity as a balance of activities pertaining to exploitation and exploration (March 1991). Thus, ambidexterity refers to firms being able to be aligned and efficient in meeting current business demands (exploitation) while simultaneously adapting to environmental changes (exploration) (Duncan 1976; Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004; Tushman and O\\u2019Reilly 1996). Building on this, the concept of operational ambidexterity, which refers to \\u201can operational unit\\u2019s simultaneous pursuit of exploration and exploitation [activities]\\u201d (Patel et al. 2012), has recently been introduced to the operations management literature. Relevant research shows that firms which are able to exhibit ambidexterity in their operational activities tend to achieve superior performance outcomes (Patel et al. 2012).  Operations and supply chain management research falls short when it comes to exploring how companies actually achieve operational ambidexterity. Even in the management literature, research considering the antecedents of ambidexterity is lacking (Adler et al. 1999; Siggelkow and Levinthal 2003). However, it is pivotal to gain a thorough understanding of the drivers, barriers, and complexities that lead firms to achieve operational ambidexterity, specifically within the new reality of omni-channel retailing, where operational ambidexterity 77  might be the key factor to a supplier\\u2019s success. In response, the proposed study addresses the following research questions: (1) To what extent do suppliers exhibit ambidextrous fulfillment operations within the omni-channel retail environment? (2) What are the enablers and barriers for suppliers to develop ambidextrous fulfillment operations?  Since the concept of operational ambidexterity is still relatively new and this research is exploratory in nature, a qualitative research approach will be used to address the aforementioned research questions. This is in line with the operations management literature calling for more qualitative research to address operational phenomena (Barratt et al. 2011; McCutcheon and Meredith 1993). In addition, the majority of the literature investigates drop-shipping from the perspective of retailers (e.g. Rabinovich 2004, Randall et al. 2002), developing mainly analytical models (e.g. Yao et al. 2008). Hence, by employing a qualitative research approach we address the methodological shortcomings associated with quantitative research methods and aim to provide a more thorough and realistic understanding of drop-shipping operations (Flynn 1990). The remainder of the paper will provide a brief overview of the relevant fulfillment operations literature and discuss the theoretical foundations. Subsequently, the methodological approach as well as the data collection and analysis processes will be discussed. Literature Review  The emergence of the Internet led to a disruption in how supply chain activities are managed and executed (Anderson and Lee 2000). Traditionally, suppliers fulfilled retailers\\u2019 pallet-sized orders, but given the changing retail environment, suppliers are increasingly expected to also fulfill individual orders from end-consumers in the name of the retailer (Agatz et al. 2008). While this latter fulfillment option, also referred to as drop-shipping, is a 78  fulfillment strategy that has been predominately used in online retailing (Rabinovich et al. 2008; Bailey and Rabinovich 2005), it may prove a viable fulfillment option across other retailer environments as well (Randall et al. 2002).  Drop-shipping has been exclusively explored within the context of online retailing (e.g., Rabinovich et al. 2008; Ayanso et al. 2006; Acimovic and Graves 2015) and three streams of research can be distinguished. The first stream of research concentrates on the impact of drop-shipping on fulfillment performance (e.g., Rabinovich 2005). More specifically, this body of work investigates how drop-shipping performance can be enhanced through emergency transshipment (Rabinovich 2005), inventory consolidation (Rabinovich and Evers 2003), and coordinating order-to-ship times and delivery times (Rabinovich 2004). Furthermore, in the case of drop-shipping, retailers are now primarily concerned with attracting end-consumers, while suppliers are concerned with fulfillment operations. This functional separation is likely to lead to difficulties in the management of the fulfillment processes (Gan et al. 2010; Yao et al. 2008). However, if suppliers provide poor fulfillment performance, end-consumers are likely to hold the retailer accountable (Bulger 2012; Rabinovich 2005). Prior research highlights the importance of the relationship between high fulfillment performance and end-consumer satisfaction and future purchase behavior (e.g. Esper et al. 2003; Rao et al. 2011). Taken together, this stream of literature suggests that drop-shipping is likely to improve an online retailer\\u2019s fulfillment performance considering different members of the supply chain. While the first stream of research focuses on the potential performance outcomes, the second stream investigates the conditions under which drop-shipping might be superior to other fulfillment options for online retailers. This body of work provides evidence that online retailers should consider product (Randall et al. 2002) and environmental characteristics 79  (Netessine and Rudi 2006) when deciding to engage in drop-shipping operations. For example, Randall et al. (2002) found that it is more desirable for online retailers to have heavy and bulky products fulfilled via drop-shipping. Moreover, with the option of employing different fulfillment operations retailers are challenged by deciding which fulfillment option, or mix therefore, is most desirable. The majority of the research supports that a mixed approach in terms of fulfillment operations is most profitable (e.g., Bailey and Rabinovich 2005; Netessine and Rudi 2006). For instance, Bailey and Rabinovich (2005) show that online retailers are better of using drop-shipping in combination with owning inventory. Overall, this body of work suggest that drop-shipping operations constitutes as one option of their overall fulfillment portfolio and should be employed based on evaluating more nuanced product and environmental characteristics. The third stream of research focuses on exploring how retailers best manage the relationship with their drop-shipping partners. Retailers give up a fair amount of control when implementing drop-shipping (Rabinovich et al. 2008); this suggests the difficulty retailers face in holding their suppliers accountable for high fulfillment performance standards. To address this issue, different management strategies, pertaining to the retailer-supplier relationship in a drop-shipping context, have been investigated. For example, research shows that revenue sharing incentives tend to improve the reliability of a drop-shipper (Yao et al. 2008). The elimination of information asymmetry in the retailer-supplier relationship has also proved beneficial, insofar as discrepancies of demand and inventory information might lead to either excessive inventory or inventory unavailability (Gan et al. 2010; Cheong et al. 2015). In addition, retailers and suppliers may experience cost reductions and performance improvements if information accuracy can be mitigated via contracts or through information 80  transparency (i.e. sharing demand and inventory information), for example (Gan et al. 2010; Cheong et al. 2015). These findings are in line with other research that considers the importance of visibility for successful supply chain management (Williams et al. 2013). Nevertheless, the current literature falls short in addressing other important research endeavors pertaining to drop-shipping. As most intriguing appears to be the fact that within the new omni-channel retail environment suppliers are expected to develop drop-shipping fulfillment operations to meet individual end-consumer demand (orders), while simultaneously fulfilling pallet size retail orders. These different fulfillment operations are likely to rely on different operational processes and capabilities leading to tensions in suppliers\\u2019 overall fulfillment processes. Furthermore, the use of drop-shipping operations is likely to dramatically increase over the next three years (Ames 2016) leading to significant changes in a supplier\\u2019s fulfillment operations and hence, inducing more complexity to the retail supply chain. Thus, considering that suppliers play an even more critical role in achieving high fulfillment performance outcomes, an investigation of how suppliers develop drop-shipping operations and integrate these with already established fulfillment operations provides a much needed extension to the extant literature. Next, the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity are offered as a way to provide further insight into this topic. Theory  Over the last decade, ambidexterity has emerged as a new theoretical paradigm in the organizational management literature (O\\u2019Reilly and Tushman 2013; Raisch and Birkinshaw 2008). The main tenet of ambidexterity, as it is understood in this context, is that in order for firms to achieve superior performance outcomes, they must strike a balance between their exploration and exploitation activities (Tushman and O\\u2019Reilly 1996).  81  According to March (1991, 71) exploitation refers to a firm\\u2019s activities, which are characterized by \\u201crefinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, and execution,\\u201d whereas exploitation activities are characterized by \\u201csearch, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, and innovation\\u201d. Firms that focus exclusively on one activity or the other will likely experience less than optimal performance outcomes. Firms emphasizing exploitation activities might not be able to adequately respond to environmental changes, due to a lack of the necessary capabilities to do so (Levitt and March 1988), and firms emphasizing exploration activities might get trapped in an reiterative circle of searching for new alternatives, without achieving satisfactory performance outcomes (Levinthal and March 1993).  Ambidexterity has recently been applied to study operations and supply chain management phenomena (e.g. Patel et al. 2012; Kristal et al. 2010; Blome et al. 2013). Aligning the two competing organizational activities (exploitation and exploration) is recognized by operations and supply chain management scholars as a potential option for companies wanting to overcome the trade-offs between operational efficiency and adaptability (e.g. Kristal et al. 2010; Patel et al. 2012). The extant operations and supply chain management literature pertaining to ambidexterity is very limited. The few studies that do investigate ambidexterity within operations and supply chain management do so providing empirical evidence for the ambidexterity-performance relationship. For example, Kristal et al. (2010) conceptualized supply chain ambidexterity and showed that implementing an ambidextrous supply chain strategy is helpful in developing supply chain capabilities and competencies, which leads to increased firm performance outcomes. Thus, future research is warranted to gain a better understanding of how companies become operationally ambidextrous.  82  Prior research has shown that especially companies operating in highly dynamic environments are likely to showcase ambidexterity (Junni et al. 2013). Due to the emergence of omni-channel retailing, the retail supply chain management can be described as rapidly changing and hence, highly dynamic. In order to succeed within this highly dynamic retail environment, suppliers must both sustain and improve current fulfillment operations while simultaneously developing new ones. In this way, the context of drop-shipping serves as a suitable domain to inform this study on operational ambidexterity. Methodology  Insofar as the proposed research questions are rather exploratory in nature, a qualitative research approach has been deemed most appropriate for this study (Ellram 1996). Adopting a qualitative approach allows to study the underlying structures, processes, and interrelationships of suppliers\\u2019 ambidextrous fulfillment operations in great detail and depth (Gephart 2004). Furthermore, such a method will allow to investigate the phenomenon in an actual contextual setting (Meredith 1998). Thus, I employ an inductive research paradigm (Warren and Karner 2005), specifically implementing a case study approach (Yin 2009).  I developed a multi-case study design following the logic of literal replication with the aim of identifying cases that would provide similar results (Yin 2009). Through careful case consideration I ensured that the selected cases would be representative of the phenomenon of interest. Thus, the initial population consisted of retail suppliers with freight and drop-shipping operations. Since fulfillment operations likely depend on product characteristics (Randall, Netessine, and Rudi 2006) and suppliers generally manage a broad variety of different products and brands, I selected the business unit as our unit of analysis.  83  The focal company for this research is a large U.S. based appliance manufacturer consisting of several business units managing a broad variety of products and brands. Due to the broad variety of product and brands, the focal company is overseeing different fulfillment operations to meet the specific brand and product requirements. For the first case I selected a fairly new business unit (ALPHA) that just recently started to establish drop-shipping operations. The second business unit (BETA) is a well-established business unit with its own fulfillment operations and has been engaged in drop-shipping operations for a longer period of time. ALPHA and BETA operate as separate business units and their main offices are located in different cities in the U.S. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the selected cases. Table 1: Overview of Case Characteristics   Case characteristics Number of informants Number of Interviews Informants' Functional areas  ALPHA ALPHA is a recently established business unit within the focal company. The current goal of ALPHA is to gain more brand recognition among end-customers. ALPHA manages different fulfillment processes for a large appliance. 8 7 Logistics and operations management, marketing, information systems, and finance BETA BETA is a well-established business unit within the focal company and manages its own separate operations. BETA offers and manages different fulfillment options for small appliances. 5 4 Logistics and operations management,  Data collection Multiple data collection methods were employed to gather rich descriptive data for the qualitative study. In-depth interviews enable researchers to perceive the world through the eyes of their research participants, which might not otherwise be possible with quantitative methods 84  (Charmaz 2014). Thus, the primary data collection method were in-depth interviews via case method which was triangulated with secondary qualitative data retrieved from news articles.  The primary researcher spent four days on site to conduct the interviews with several informants for each case study. While higher level managers are able to provide more strategic insights on the phenomenon of interest (Joshi et al. 2003), lower level managers are able to provide more tactical insights on the phenomenon of interest. Thus, I interviewed informants from different organizational levels. In addition, the primary researcher had the opportunity to visit and tour two of the focal company\\u2019s distribution centers to observe the operational activities. Throughout the four day visit, the primary researcher also had a chance to closely shadow the key informant. I carefully developed a semi-structured interview guide with open-ended questions to guide the conversation, and probes to ask for additional description and details. Appendix A provides an overview of the actual interview guide. The interviews lasted between 20 to 100 minutes, and all interviews were audio-recorded with the permission of the informants and professionally transcribed leading to a total of 160 pages of qualitative text. I conducted seven interviews at ALPHA and five interviews at BETA. Out of the total of 12 participants, nine held higher managerial positions and three lower level managerial positions. Four participants held positions outside the operations/logistics area providing cross-functional insights about the phenomenon of interest.   To gain even more in-depth insights and knowledge on the phenomenon of interest I collected secondary qualitative data in the form of online news articles discussing drop-shipping operations. Using news articles discussing the topic of interest allows us to triangulate our data (Patton 1990). The online news articles were collected from the top online supply 85  chain management publications for industry professionals by Friddell (2015). Out of the originally listed 12 top supply chain management publications we selected the ones most relevant to retail supply chain management and with an open search option for articles on the website. I conducted an initial search on each of the online publications\\u2019 websites with the search terms \\u201cdrop-shipping\\u201d and \\u201cdrop-ship\\u201d. Table 2 summarizes the top supply chain management publications used for this research and the number of initial articles from each publication. The initial search resulted in 98 articles. Next, I removed any duplicates and articles published before the year 2010 since omni-channel retailing especially gained traction after 2010. The final sample constitutes 43 articles for further content analysis. Table 2: Selected Online Supply Chain Publications and Number of Initial Articles Online Source Number of Initial Articles CSCMP'S Supply Chain Quarterly 3 DC Velocity 15 Inbound Logistics 21 Logistics Management 1 Material Handling & Logistics 22 Supply Chain Brain 20 Supply Chain Management Review 0 Supply and Demand Executives 11 Total         93  Data Analysis The basis for the within-case analysis (Yin 2009) constitutes an initial coding and focused coding phase of all interviews resulting in a detailed, descriptive memo for each case (Ellram 1996; Barratt et al. 2011). Coding allows the researcher to connect contextual rich descriptions with more abstract theoretical categories, which served as the \\u201cbones of the analysis\\u201d (Charmaz 2014, p.113).  86  The initial coding phase allowed for the emergence of a wide array of theoretical concepts and ideas stemming from the data (Charmaz 2014). In the initial coding phase, I assigned a code to a smaller segment of data (i.e. sentence). After the initial coding phase, I moved on to the focused coding phase, during which I sorted, synthesized, and organized large amounts of data into more parsimonious codes.  After going through several iterations between the data and codes and organizing the focused codes in a structured manner, I conducted a cross-case analysis. This analysis allowed me to compare and identify commonalities and differences across the two cases, which allowed for a more complete and holistic understanding of the phenomenon of interest (Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 2009). Lastly, I triangulated the findings from the two cases studies by using a content analysis of the news articles I collected. The news articles were coded using the focused codes emerging from the interview data to substantiate the findings.  To assess the thoroughness of the case study approach, I carefully addressed the proposed evaluation criteria for case study research (Yin 2009; Eisenhardt 1989; Voss, Tsikriktsis, and Frohlich 2002; Stuart et al. 2002): construct validity, internal validity, external validity, and reliability in the case study design and execution. Table 3 summarizes the evaluation criteria and how they were implemented.   87  Table 3: Case research validity and reliability based on Yin 2009, Eisenhardt 1989, Voss, Tsikriktsis, and Frohlich 2002, and Stuart et al. 2002 Evaluation Criteria Tactic Used Construct Validity (define the appropriate operational measures for the concepts under study) Defining concepts a priori (drop-shipping, operational ambidexterity, exploitation, and exploration).

Emerging Themes and Concepts   The following section describes in detail the themes and concepts that emerged from the analysis of the cases and secondary qualitative data. From the data, two frameworks emerged. The first framework is associated with drop-shipping operations and focuses on the drivers and operational challenges thereof. The second framework is grounded in the theoretical underpinning of ambidexterity and captures the underlying mechanisms of 88  operational ambidexterity. Figure 1 illustrates the general framework pertaining to establishing drop-shipping operations that emerged from the data and Table 4 provides descriptions and examples of the emerging themes. From the analysis of the cases and news articles three main themes emerged, which are denoted as drivers, operational challenges, and outcomes. Figure 1: Drop-shipping operations: Drivers and operational challenges       89  Table 4: Description and examples for emerging codes Category Code Description Example  Drivers Reacting refers to the supplier developing drop-shipping operations to address the changing retail environment \\\"The market for supply chain design is growing as more companies realize they have to reexamine their networks, and make sure their network of distribution centers and plants are in line with changing market conditions.\\\"   Accepting refers to the supplier developing drop-shipping operations as a necessity \\\"So it came out of necessity really, where retailer A and retailer B were not going to hold inventory, they wanted us to just ship direct to their consumers.\\\"    Penetrating refers to the supplier developing drop-shipping operations to gain access to more end-customers \\\"I think when XYZ was originally launched the perspective was to let's get in as many doors as we can\\\"  Operational challenges Customization refers to the supplier's problems with customizing the drop-shipping processes \\\"Now since the consumer\\u2019s ordering them, instead of a two-pack of blenders, they want a single blender.\\\"   Complying refers to the individual supply chain members problems with adhering to requirements \\\"Really as we were onboarding them, trying to get that information on them on the front end.\\\"    Coordinating refers to supplier's problems with managing the drop-shipping operations \\\"We\\u2019re expected to get the D to C orders out the door within 24 hours of receiving them here.  So that\\u2019s how the people on the floor are supposed to prioritize the work.\\\"         90  Drivers of drop-shipping operations  The analysis demonstrates that there are three predominant reasons why suppliers business units/companies decide to establish drop-shipping operations. The first driver of establishing drop-shipping is that suppliers are reacting to the changes in the retail environment. Consumer expectations in this new omni-channel retail environment are steadily increasing especially due to the \\u201cAmazon effect\\u201d (Ames 2016). As a theme the \\u201cAmazon effect\\u201d emerged from the secondary qualitative data. The \\u201cAmazon effect\\u201d refers to Amazon\\u2019s offering of free and fast shipping which consequently leads to consumers expecting an equivalent high service offerings to be the norm across other retailers (Shiphawk 2015). Within this new retail environment constituting of high consumer expectations and a fierce competition from other businesses, ALPHA considers it as a necessity for businesses to rethink and restructure fulfillment operations. A marketing manager at ALPHA notes: \\u201cIf people are going online and order their stuff themselves it affects how much brick-and-mortar do you need anymore? How many real buildings? You know, everyone had to redefine.\\u201d Hence, suppliers seem to develop and establish drop-shipping operations to \\u201credefine\\u201d themselves and to adequately react to the changes occurring in the retail environment.  A second theme that emerged for the drivers for drop-shipping operations is accepting drop-shipping operations as a requirement from the retailer. The case observations indicate that the retailer plays an important role for suppliers to establishing drop-shipping observations for two reasons. Specifically, the observations for ALPHA substantiate that retailers \\u201crule the show\\u201d almost forcing the business unit to engage in drop-shipping. Hence, suppliers might not have another choice than to follow the retailer\\u2019s requirement and establish drop-shipping operations. One of the logistics/operations managers stated: \\u201cWell, their role was really to 91  force our hand to develop that because they weren\\u2019t going to sell with us if we weren\\u2019t going to ship direct to consumer.\\u201d  Another reason why suppliers simply accept the fact that they have to establish drop-shipping operations might be due to product characteristics. ALPHA, managing a large and heavy appliance, experienced reluctance from retailers to further stock the product due to the weight and length dimensions of the product. A logistics/operations manager from ALPHA noted: \\u201cAgain, it\\u2019d be something they don\\u2019t handle very well with the size and that.  So they said, \\u201cIf you want to do business here, you\\u2019re going to do it direct to consumer.\\u201d   Lastly, suppliers establish drop-shipping operations as a way of directly penetrating the consumer market. In the drop-shipping model the retailer as \\u201cmiddleman\\u201d is removed, providing suppliers with direct access to end-customers. In addition, suppliers are also able to offer a larger product variety to end-customers to subsequently increase their market share. Thus, the overarching theme of directly penetrating the consumer market consists of accessing end-customers and of servicing end-customers better with a larger product variety. In the case of BETA, a logistics/operations manager extensively discussed that drop-shipping operations were established to have access to a larger end-customer base to gain a competitive advantage. The manager noted: \\u201cWe want to expand drop ship because we think we\\u2019ll be able to sell a bigger assortment of products for our retailers and they don\\u2019t have to hold the inventory.  There is a belief that we are missing out on sales and so we need to expand it to more retailers and more footprints.\\u201d    92  Operational challenges of drop-shipping operations  Operational challenges associated with establishing and managing drop-shipping operations emerged as another major theme from the data. While suppliers are used to the processes of fulfilling freight orders for their retailers, the requirement of directly fulfilling end-customer orders involves new processes for the supplier. Hence, suppliers adding drop-shipping operations to their fulfillment capabilities are likely to experience operational tensions and challenges The first operational challenge emerging from the cases was customizing the drop-shipping fulfillment process. For example, end-customers might wish to have the product wrapped in gift-wrapping paper or attach a personal note to their order leading to highly customized orders. One factor contributing to the high customization of the drop-shipping process are any value-added services the supplier is executing. Hence, each end-customer order is not only different in terms of the products that need to be picked but also in terms of what additional services the end-customers request. A logistics/operations manager from APLPHA referred to value-added services as \\u201ca nightmare\\u201d since it adds additional complexity to the fulfillment process. A manager from BETA further elaborated: \\u201cLike with Product X, Product X is kind of a huge nightmare because the CO2 tanks in them make them hazmat so we have to ship them out specially so they have to be in the VAS station to be specially processed so that they go out hazmat.  So there\\u2019s a lot of stuff that happens in the VAS station.\\u201d  A second factor contributing to customizing the drop-shipping process is the volume. The cases indicate that especially when only a low volume is fulfilled via drop-shipping, the fulfillment process is prone to be highly manual in nature. In the case of ALPHA, handling a small volume for drop-shipping, every step in the drop-shipping process was manually in the 93  beginning. A marketing manager noted: \\u201cI mean a lot of the stuff we did was manual. I mean we actually have been drop manual, we manually dropped documents and manually send trucks and manually fix problems. So it was a nightmare from our perspective and trying to start business.\\u201d  A second operational challenge that emerged from the data was complying with retailer requirements. The secondary qualitative data specifically highlighted the importance of vendor compliance for successful drop-shipping operations. Our secondary qualitative data indicate that \\u201cThe urgency around attaining the perfect order through compliance programs is amplified, thanks to a number of factors\\u201d (Terry 2013), one of these factors being the \\u201cincreasing use of direct shipping from vendors.\\u201d However, the observations from the cases indicate that achieving compliance might not be an easy endeavor for suppliers. Suppliers work with a great number of retailers and hence, have to adhere to a lot of different requirements dictated by the retailers. A specific problem ALPHA experienced was that the requirements were only communicated after the sales agreement had been signed, increasing time pressure on other business functions to comply with the requirements. An information systems manager from APLHA described: \\u201cTheir mission is go out and get sales agreements.  So they go out and do that and we\\u2019re \\u2013 I don\\u2019t want to say the afterthought, but once they get the sales agreement, then they send us all the information with a deadline that sometimes we can meet and sometimes we can\\u2019t meet.  99 percent of the time we do meet it, but if it\\u2019s a real short time frame, we meet it but we don\\u2019t meet it following the processes that we like to follow, but we need to follow to make sure that we have everything covered.\\u201d The third theme that emerged was coordinating with other external and internal entities to establish drop-shipping operations. Carriers play an important role in the success of drop-94  shipping processes. ALPHA described an incident where carriers were reluctant to adjust their processes to ensure that the product arrives at the end-customer\\u2019s house undamaged. The failure to coordinate with the carrier from the beginning on resulted in damaged products and hence, in unsatisfied end-customers. Consequently, ALPHA started to adjust its packaging to prevent damage and coordinated with the carrier to ensure that the product is handled in a different manner. A logistics/operations manager recalled: \\u201cGetting them (the carrier) to look at a different shipment with different requirements reliably is incredibly difficult when they\\u2019re just used to turning numbers.\\u201d  Also, coordinating with internal business functions constitutes a challenge when establishing drop-shipping operations. ALPHA described a situation where the sales team agreed with the retailer on doing drop-shipping without consulting the logistics/operations managers first. After the agreement had been signed, ALPHA discovered that it actually did not have the necessary capabilities in place. \\u201cSo that capability didn\\u2019t exist and the people over here behind me that handle all the major stuff had no clue as to how to do any of that.\\u201d   In addition, the observations suggest that coordinating with the IT department is also of essence. In the cases, the majority of orders arrived through the EDI system. However, the EDI systems were configured to receive standardized retail orders but with drop-shipping the EDI systems need to be compatible to receive orders where the ship to address is different for each end-customer. ALPHA and BETA spend ample amount of time and effort with the IT department to coordinate the new system configurations. A manager from ALPHA stated: \\u201cChris (name changed by the author) was tremendous in the process of setting them up \\u2018cause he knew what the requirements were and what the capabilities were versus what we had on 95  hand and he figured out how to do the processing of the EDI to override the ship to and to do an appropriate direct consumer order taking.\\u201d    The general framework of drivers and operational challenges discussed above provides interesting insights and a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon of drop-shipping. In a second level of interpretation I was focusing on uncovering the findings pertaining to the interrelationships of exploitation, exploration, and ambidexterity to gain a better understanding how suppliers become operational ambidextrous. Figure 2 illustrates the emerging findings from the second level analysis. Figure 2: The cyclicality of exploitation and exploration  Operational ambidexterity: An emerging process model  Prior to becoming ambidextrous, suppliers focus on exploiting their already established operations (freight operations) to gain further operational efficiencies. In the case of ALPHA standard operating procedures have been developed and are already in place to execute freight operations. However, through a continuous improvement program developed by the mother 96  company the already existing operating procedures are steadily refined to increase performance. A manager from ALPHA noted: \\u201c[the mother company\\u2019s] really good at continuous improvement, and putting projects around things, and trying to take as much of that variation as we can out of the system.  We have a pretty solid black belt program and green belt program to go in and try to lean out the operations and dummy proof them as much as we can. \\u201c   The focus of improving already established operations gets disrupted by the changing retail environment. Thus, suppliers seek to reinvent themselves and rethink their fulfillment operations to stay competitive within this new omni-channel retail environment which subsequently leads to the exploration of drop-shipping operations. A manager from ALPHA stated: \\u201cBut the ability for people to go online and learn about the product and see what\\u2019s going on Facebook and Twitter and you know. That\\u2019s what we learned on the major appliance side years, several years ago was what how much more educated consumers are today. They walk in with their iphone and their ipad. They know more about the appliance than you do. They have got all their reviews and all the lots and everything right there in front of them. They can check your price against whoever they want to standing right in front of you.\\u201d  Furthermore, the cases show that once the supplier acknowledges the changing retail environment, the supplier enters a phase of predominately exploring drop-shipping as a new fulfillment operation. ALPHA experienced the changing retail environment as a disrupting factor to their already established fulfillment operations which led ALPHA to \\u201clook around at what the processes were inside of [the mother company] for direct to consumer.\\u201d  Once the supplier enters the phase of focusing on exploring drop-shipping operations, the suppliers experiences the need for balancing already established fulfillment operations with 97  developing the new drop-shipping operations (ambidexterity). The findings from the cases suggest that it depends on the volume how suppliers will manage to keep the balance between the different operational activities. ALPHA and BETA have highly integrated fulfillment processes whereas BETA\\u2019s seemed more advanced since they are automated. ALPHA, processing a small volume of drop-ship orders and having manual processes, highly integrated its processes for drop-shipping with its already existing operational processes. Moreover, this highly integrative approach of balancing freight with drop-ship operations was noted by a manager from ALPHA as \\u201cbeing the parasite\\u201d and \\u201cpiggybacking.\\u201d A manager further explained: \\u201cWe had to fit our processes to hit their processes because it\\u2019s just economically desirable to have one additional [product] or five [name of the product removed by the author] units go in with a truckload of other stuff.\\u201d  Most interestingly, from the conversations with managers from BETA (processing a higher volume of drop-ship orders and having an automated system), it emerged that as volume is further increasing the managers will look into separating freight fulfillment operations from drop-shipping operations to some degree. Currently BETA experiences difficulties in terms of balancing freight with drop-ship orders since each of these activities has different requirements. A manager from BETA explained: \\u201cWhen the get mixed together, they\\u2019re not really mixed together.  It\\u2019s just these happen before these will happen, so we see really big spikes in our small pack volumes and then our freight volumes die off.  They just conversely work against each other.  So an issue with that process is not being able to differentiate them through our operational how we process them, which results in delayed times to focus on one group or the other.\\u201c  98   The cases furthermore indicate that the phase of focusing on exploring drop-shipping operations return to a phase of exploitation. However, in this next phase of exploitation the supplier improved both, freight and drop-shipping operations suggesting that there might be a dynamic component associated with exploitation and exploration. For instance, ALPHA described a situation where the business unit earlier engaged in exploring how the EDI processes for drop-shipping operations can be developed. Once these EDI processes had been developed, they can now be exploited and implemented with other trade partners. A manager from ALPHA recalled: \\u201cNow, if we\\u2019re gonna maintain Retailer X I\\u2019m gonna work on getting them on EDI just because it needs to happen.  Once I get them into [\\u2026] then I think I have an already established and I can just add it as an offering, so I don\\u2019t have to go back and redo all the testing that I\\u2019d done before.  So I think that\\u2019ll be a big win for us.\\u201d  Thus, our cases provide evidence for a cyclicality between exploitation and exploration.  Discussion and Literature Integration    The case studies in combination with the secondary qualitative data provide interesting and nuanced understandings of drop-shipping operations and operational ambidexterity. However, to gain a broader understanding of the meaning of the findings, they should be considered within the extant literature. Thus, to further interpret the findings I synthesized and integrated the prior literature on drop-shipping and operational ambidexterity into the discussion. While this research corroborates some prior findings, it more importantly offers interesting and new insights into themes not addressed in the prior literature stimulating potential future research ideas.   99  Drop-shipping Research on drop-shipping is limited and mainly focuses on investigating the phenomenon from the perspective of online retailers, providing insights when it would make sense for a retailer to engage in drop-shipping (Randall et al. 2006). In line with the finding that retailers are an important driver for suppliers to establish drop-shipping operations, the drop-shipping literature further substantiates that retailers serve as a driver for suppliers to develop drop-shipping operations (e.g. Rabinovich 2005; Randall et al. 2006; Bailey and Rabinovich 2005). However, the findings of this study indicate that other drivers for establishing drop-shipping operations may exist which could be categorized as being external (reacting to the changing retail environment) or internal (penetrating to the market) to the supplier. The most interesting finding probably is that while suppliers might develop drop-shipping operations to service their retailers, suppliers establish drop-shipping operations for their own benefits. Thus, this research contributes to the extant drop-shipping literature by providing an explanation of why suppliers establish drop-shipping operations.   Retailers deciding to engage in drop-shipping leave their suppliers not only with the associated costs and risks but also the responsibility of executing all fulfillment operations to the retailer\\u2019s standards (Rabinovich et al. 2008). While the decision for retailers to engage in drop-shipping might be more strategic in nature, the suppliers will take on all operational responsibility and associated challenges. Therefore, this research extends the current drop-shipping literature by shifting the research focus away from retailers to suppliers; and hence, shifting the focus from a strategic towards a more tactical perspective since suppliers will be required to figure out the details as it pertains to establishing efficient drop-shipping operations. 100  The findings pertaining to the operational challenges of complying and coordinating suggest that these issues are rooted within the broader subject of managing relationships in supply chain management. The findings advocate that businesses appear to still operate within functional silos and lack coordination with other supply chain partners although extensively discussed in the literature (e.g. Stank et al. 1999; Fawcett and Magnan 2002). Furthermore, the finding of suppliers complying with retailers\\u2019 requirements could be perceived as one mechanisms that governs the supplier-retailer relationship. Overall, these findings suggest that there might also be a relational component to establishing and managing successful drop-shipping operations such as supplier accommodation (Murfield and Esper 2016) or internal and external integration (Flynn et al. 2010). Furthermore, prior studies employed only quantitative methods to investigate the impacts of drop-shipping operations (e.g., Bendoly 2004; Elliot Rabinovich 2005). While quantitative methods are appropriate to explore specific relationships between two or more variables deducted from theory, these methods do not allow for a richer and descriptive exploration of the phenomenon. By employing a qualitative approach using a case study designs and secondary qualitative data, this research provides a rich and descriptive understanding of drop-shipping operations uncovering the associated drivers and operational challenges. Therefore, this research helps and extends our current understanding of the drivers of drop-shipping operations and associated operational challenges. Operational ambidexterity The notion of ambidexterity has only recently been introduced to the operations management field and the resulting research is fairly limited (Patel et al.  2012; Kristal et al. 2010). In an operations management context, the theoretical premises of ambidexterity suggest 101  that companies exploiting already existing operational activities while exploring new operational activities will achieve higher performance outcomes than if the company focuses on either of these two activities (Duncan 1976; Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004; Tushman and O\\u2019Reilly 1996). The limited body of work on operational ambidexterity focuses exclusively on testing the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity rooted in the field of management neglecting why and how firms develop and manage operational ambidexterity. The qualitative research approach provided me with the opportunity to stimulate a discussion about the theoretical understanding of operational ambidexterity. A key findings from this research suggest that exploration of new operational activities require a \\u201ctrigger\\u201d or \\u201cdisruptive event\\u201d. This observation suggests that in the context of drop-shipping, environmental changes may serve as a trigger shifting the focus of companies away from exploiting already existing business activities and leading them to focus on exploring of new business actions. Prior research has shown that firms facing a highly competitive and dynamic environment exhibit tendencies to engage in exploring new business activities (Jansen et al. 2005; Auh and Menguc 2005) and support our observations.  This research further enhances our understanding of operational ambidexterity by providing at least some insights into the widely debate about the appropriate internal structural solution to manage ambidexterity. The ambidexterity literature lacks a clear understanding whether ambidexterity is achieved through integration or separation (Raisch and Birkinshaw 2008). From the management literature addressing ambidexterity structural differentiation emerged as one option to successfully manage ambidexterity (e,g., Tushman and O\\u2019Reilly 1996; Gilbert 2005). However, the extent to which these structural differences should be integrated is not well understood yet, and hence, warrants further investigation. Considering 102  operational ambidexterity in the context of drop-shipping, the findings of this study suggest that if the processes volume for drop-shipping is low, a higher degree of operational integration is appropriate while a lower degree of integration (or separation) is perceived to be more appropriate with higher volume. Thus, this research exposed volume to be an important contingency factor to consider when investigating the structural solution for managing operational ambidexterity. In addition, I was able to present some evidence suggesting that exploitation and exploration occur in a cyclical nature, suggesting that suppliers shift between phases of exploiting established operations and exploring new operations. The cyclical nature of exploitation and exploration in a drop-shipping context might suggest that operational ambidexterity is a dynamic process rather than a static status. This observation is further substantiated by Nickerson and Zenger (2002) and Siggelkow and Levinthal (2003)  who suggested that firms cycle through phases of exploitation and exploration. Thus, suggesting that there is critical dynamic component to exploration and when it actually transfers into exploitation. However, prior research on operational ambidexterity focused on investigating the phenomenon at a specific point in time, neglecting any potential effects over time.  Based on the discussed findings future operational ambidexterity is warranted. The discussed findings pertaining to operational ambidexterity uncover additional interesting and relevant research areas to grow the understanding of operational ambidexterity within the supply chain and operations management field. Table 5 provides suggestions for additional research in different areas pertaining to operational ambidexterity.   103  Table 5: Future operational ambidexterity research Research Area Future operational ambidexterity research  Antecedents of operational ambidexterity Investigate antecedents that shift suppliers from focusing on exploiting already established fulfillment operations to exploring new fulfillment operations. Managing operational ambidexterity Explore how suppliers balance already established operations with new operations depends on the processed volume such that a low volume may be associated with a higher degree of process integration than a high volume.  Role of time for operational ambidexterity Consider the potential time effects on exploration and exploitation. Exploration of new operational activities is finite in time duration and hence, there is a specific point in time when explorations of new operational activities turns into exploitation of established operational activities.  Managerial Implications and Future Research  Managerial implications The importance for suppliers to be able to provide drop-shipping operations for their customers is further increasing. The majority of retail managers expect to increase their use of drop-shipping over the next three years (Ames 2016). I provide insights to managers that the request for drop-shipping might take the supplier as a surprise with a lack of preparedness. Hence, in anticipation of more demand for drop-shipping operations from retailers, suppliers should evaluate whether they already have the necessary drop-ship capabilities in house and develop a plan for implementation to be better prepared for this new fulfillment option. In addition, establishing drop-shipping operations constitutes a great opportunity for suppliers to gain access to a broader end-customer base. Therefore, suppliers might want to consider establishing drop-shipping operations as a viable option to further penetrate the market and to grow their market share.  104  Furthermore, when establishing drop-shipping operations suppliers should work closely with other supply chain members. This research indicates that retailers play an important role for establishing successful drop-shipping operations. Suppliers are likely to provide drop-shipping solutions to a broad retailer base and hence, will have to adhere to different compliance guidelines. Retailers could help suppliers to achieve higher compliance rates by aligning their compliances with the ones from other retailer. For example, the Retail Value Chain Federation works with retailers to arrange the used terminology and terms to support the operations of the suppliers (Terry 2013).  Moreover, this research suggests that the importance of carriers and other internal departments for successful drop-shipping operations cannot be neglected. For example, if the product is damaged during the delivery process because the carrier is reluctant to adjust its handling operations from freight to individual end-customer orders, end-customer responses might be negative impacting suppliers and retailers a like. Hence, carriers should be informed and integrated into establishing drop-shipping operations early on to ensure carriers have the necessary capabilities and operating procedures in place. In addition to integrating carriers, managers should also strengthen the integration of departments within the company. As the findings of this research show, especially the sales and operations functions still appear to be not integrated leading to major issues. Thus, the internal integration especially between sales and operations but also with other functional areas should be increased. Lastly, the findings of this research suggest that suppliers should carefully evaluate the degree of integrating their drop-shipping operations with its freight operations. Suppliers that drop-ship only low volumes might benefit from a higher degree of integration with the already 105  established freight operations. However, suppliers that drop-ship large volume might benefit from a lower level of integration between its freight and drop-ship operations. Limitations and future research  This research is grounded in the context of drop-shipping and hence, might not be generalizable to other contexts. Future research might consider other contextual settings that would suggest suppliers to exhibit operational ambidexterity to provide further insights. Such an extension of this research would further provide understanding into why and how suppliers become operationally ambidextrous.  In addition, this research is qualitative in nature and thus, provides only an exploratory, rich and deep description of drop-shipping and operational ambidexterity. While this research reveals several themes and their potential interrelationships, future research might wish to complement it by employing a quantitative research approach. For example, survey research could be used to further investigate the potential drivers of drop-shipping and hence, of operational ambidexterity.   Lastly, I conducted two case studies that lend themselves for a literal replication. However, to gain further theoretical insights on how suppliers become and manage operational ambidexterity further case studies would be required to allow for a theoretical replication (Yin 2009). Thus, to extend this research one might consider cases with suppliers that do not have established drop-shipping operations yet to better contrast them against our findings.    106  References  Acimovic, J., and Graves, S.C. 2015. \\u201cMaking Better Fulfillment Decisions on the Fly in an Online Retail Environment.\\u201d Manufacturing & Service Operations Management 17 (1): 34\\u201351.

Essay 3  Leveraging Omni-Channel Fulfillment Operations for Service Recovery                         115  Introduction  Frequent stockouts are a major concern for retailers. This is because stockouts often lead to negative consumer behavior (Zinn and Liu 2001) and substantial financial losses for retailers (Aastrup and Kotzab 2009). However, within the new reality of omni-channel retailing, described as a seamlessly integrated retail environment of physical and electronic channels (Brynjolfsson et al. 2013), retailers have new options to potentially \\u201csave the sale\\u201d in the case of a stockout. Following a stockout, a retailer may offer to order the unavailable product online and ship it to either the store or directly to the customer\\u2019s home. For example, in early 2015, JC Penney, a national, mid-range department store in the U.S., began offering free online shipping of unavailable products to the store. Thus, in the case of a stockout, JC Penney leverages its omni-channel fulfillment operations to provide their customers with products, even though the product is unavailable in the store. This example illustrates that omni-channel retailers might now have the necessary retail service operations to provide consumers with a more timely and convenient stockout recovery than in the past. While retailers might have the necessary service fulfillment operations in place to recover from a stockout, it is important to gain an understanding of how consumers evaluate these services (Roth and Menor 2003). Prior research demonstrates that service failures lead to negative consumer attitudes and behaviors, such as dissatisfaction (e.g. Allen et al. 2014), negative word-of-mouth (e.g. Lin et al. 2011), or customer complaints (Knox and van Oest 2014). Having a service recovery strategy in place (Kelly et al. 1993) provides companies with the opportunity to transform negative consumer attitudes and behaviors into positive ones (Bitner et al. 1990). Service operations literature specifically stresses the importance of consumers\\u2019 \\u201cfairness\\u201d perceptions when evaluating a company\\u2019s recovery efforts (Craighead et al. 2004). Positive post-recovery 116  perceptions can be achieved if a retailer meets consumers\\u2019 recovery expectations through offering the right bundle of recovery strategies. This in turn is likely to translate into more equitable (\\u201cfair\\u201d) perceptions leading to improved post-recovery satisfaction levels (e.g. Roggeveen et al. 2012).  In the case of a stockout, retailers traditionally had either no or only limited options to recover from such a failure. For instance, a retailer could provide consumers with alternative substitute products (Breugelmans et al. 2006) or offer a rain check (Kelley et al 1993). However in an omni-channel retail environment, a retailer\\u2019s operational activities can now be used to recover from a stockout (Miller et al. 2000). One interesting issue that emerges within the omni-channel retail environment is whether consumers perceive it as \\u201cfair\\u201d if the retailer leverages its omni-channel fulfillment operations to recover from a stockout. It is also suggested from prior literature that situational factors, such as purchase urgency, might play an important role when investigating consumer responses to stockouts (e.g. Zinn and Liu 2008; Zinn and Liu 2001; Peinkofer et al. 2015). Hence, contextual effects influence whether consumers evaluate a retailer\\u2019s recovery strategy as more equitable (\\u201cfairer\\u201d). Thus, while fulfillment operations now play a new and increasingly important role in stockout recovery these emerging issues warrant further exploration. This is specifically important considering that the majority of retailers still struggle with implementing and managing their omni-channel operations, despite the fact that omni-channel fulfillment is slowly becoming standard (Forrester Research, Inc. 2014).  Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine how omni-channel fulfillment operations can be used to recover from a stockout. More precisely the aim is to investigate (1) how, in the case of a stockout, different attributes of a retailer\\u2019s omni-channel fulfillment 117  operations impact consumer satisfaction and their evaluation of a retailer\\u2019s physical distribution service quality (PDSQ); (2) how do consumers evaluate these service recovery attributes in terms of perceived \\u201cfairness\\u201d; and, (3) the role the purchase experience\\u2019s contextual effects have on consumers\\u2019 evaluation of a retailer\\u2019s stockout recovery strategy. Using equity theory (Adams 1965), this manuscript implements a series of experimental studies to explore the impact omni-channel fulfillment operations have on consumer satisfaction levels and PDSQ evaluations. More precisely, the studies examine if various fulfillment service attributes, such as convenience and speed, positively impact consumer satisfaction after a stockout. To that end, this manuscript will also investigate the underlying mechanisms for \\u201cwhy\\u201d satisfaction occurs. Additionally, I consider the shopping context of the consumer (i.e. whether the consumer needs vs. does not need a particular product). Thus, this manuscript will contribute to the growing body of literature examining consumer issues in supply-chain and operations management (e.g. Rao et al. 2011b; Griffis et al. 2012b). The remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows: reviews of the relevant literature pertaining to inventory availability, fulfillment operations, service recovery, and associated supply-chain issues are presented. The manuscript then proceeds by introducing the theoretical framework and research hypotheses. Literature Review  Fulfillment Operations  The body of literature focusing on consumer issues in the fields of operations and supply-chain management is still growing. Over the last decade, two distinct streams of 118  literature have emerged. The first stream considers investigates inventory management, product distribution, and order fulfillment strategies within an online retailing context (e.g. Rabinovich and Evers 2003; Rabinovich 2004; Griffis et al. 2012b; Cheong et al. 2015). This body of research focuses on the internal or operational aspect of retail service operations (Roth and Menor 2003). For instance, researchers investigate whether inventory consolidation (Rabinovich and Evers 2003) and emergency transshipments (Rabinovich 2005) can prevent or improve order fulfillment. They also investigate how trade-offs in actual and signaled order-to-shipment and delivery times impact consumer attitudes (Rabinovich 2004). Further, this stream of research considers the potential cost trade-offs between various fulfillment strategies, such as inventory holding and transportation costs (e.g. Cheong et al. 2015; Netessine and Rudi 2006; Bendoly et al. 2007). Overall, this stream of literature argues that retailers should develop and then leverage an online channel to achieve high product availability and fulfillment performance. Moreover, implementing an omni-channel supply-chain enables retailers to evaluate different fulfillment strategies in terms of cost and profitability. The second stream focuses on consumers\\u2019 responses to order fulfillment processes and failures, particularly late deliveries (Rao et al. 2011b), product returns (Griffis et al. 2012a; Rao et al. 2014), and stockouts (e.g. Dadzie and Winston 2007; Pizzi and Scarpi 2013). This stream highlights the growing importance of consumer-level variables, such as consumer satisfaction (e.g. Esper et al. 2003) and perceptions of PDSQ (e.g. Koufteros et al. 2014). For example, Boyer and Hult (2006) find that different order fulfillment strategies impact consumer retention differently and Rao et al. (2011a) show that the perceptions of a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ positively correlate with consumer satisfaction and retention levels.  119  The second stream specifically highlights the importance of retailers achieving positive consumer PDSQ perceptions (e.g. Rao et al. 2014; Rabinovich and Bailey 2004; Griffis et al. 2012b). Understanding how consumers evaluate a retailer\\u2019s service operations is key to offering superior retail services (Roth and Menor 2003). Consumers are more satisfied and more likely to re-purchase from a retailer when they perceive a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ performance to be high (Rao et al. 2011a). Consumer perceptions of PDSQ gain further importance when evaluating a stockout recovery within an omni-channel retail context. If a stockout occurs, consumers tend to negatively evaluate a retailer because their PDSQ is presumed to be insufficient. However, by leveraging established omni-channel fulfillment operations, retailers might be able to turn this negative situation into a positive PDSQ evaluation. Since failures in the fulfillment process are likely to result in negative reactions from consumers and may lead to a loss of sales, this stream of research emphasizes the importance of retailers and their respective supply-chain members to provide reliable and exceptional fulfillment services to consumers. Inventory Availability Inventory availability constitutes a key operations performance measure of retail supply-chains (Emmelhainz et al. 1991), however poor supply-chain management (DeHoratius and Raman 2008; Ettouzani et al. 2012; Raman et al. 2001) may result in stockouts that negatively impact manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. Stockouts fall under typical retail operation failures (Kelley et al. 1993) and a growing body of literature investigates the potential impact of stockouts for upstream and downstream supply chain members has emerged.  120  Research has established that consumers negatively react to retail operation failures (e.g. Pizzi and Scarpi 2013; Kim and Lennon 2011; Rao et al. 2011b; Ofla\\u00e7 et al. 2012). For example, Pizzi and Scarpi (2013) show that stockouts negatively impact re-patronage behavior and Rao et al. (2011b) provide evidence for delivery failures leading to a decrease in the frequency and size of future orders. Therefore, retailers need to implement recovery strategies to mitigate these negative reactions. With regard to stockouts, Kim and Lennon (2011) and Breugelmans et al. (2006) argue online retailers should inform their consumers up front about inventory availability. And Pizzi and Scarpi (2013) suggest that online retailers can mitigate negative consumer responses by taking responsibility for the stockout. These strategies only lessen, but do not fully recover, consumer dissatisfaction following an operational failure. However, within the new reality of omni-channel retailing, retailers have the opportunity to fully recover from a stockout by leveraging their omni-channel fulfillment operations.  To summarize, prior research has contributed to an understanding of how consumers respond to stockouts in a single-channel retail setting. With the growth of online retailing over the past decade, the vast majority of work has been conducted exclusively within an online retailing context (e.g. Griffis et al. 2012a; Pizzi and Scarpi 2013; Rao et al. 2011b). A small body of literature has started to explore how consumer dissatisfaction resulting from retail service failures might be mitigated. However, important research opportunities have not yet been addressed, such as how an omni-channel retail environment disrupts and alters traditional consumer behavior and expectations pertaining to stockouts. Moreover, extant research has not considered how omni-channel fulfillment operations may help to recover consumer satisfaction following a stockout. Thus, there is an opportunity for the service recovery literature to provide 121  further insights with regard to how and why omni-channel fulfillment operations as a recovery strategy can impact consumer satisfaction levels and PDSQ evaluations. Service Recovery A stockout constitutes a service failure, which refers to any service that is unfulfilled, delayed, or does not meet consumer expectations (Bitner et al. 1990). Service recovery is conceptualized as a firm strategy (Hart et al. 1990) that attempts to restore a damaged relationship between a company and a consumer (Knox and van Oest 2014). However, service failure literature demonstrates that each recovery strategy achieves, if at all, different levels of improved consumer satisfaction. In fact, a strategy\\u2019s success depends on a series of factors, such as failure type and magnitude (e.g. Kelley et al. 1993; Smith et al. 1999; Blodgett et al. 1997). Considering these prior findings, it is of great importance to carefully evaluate which recovery strategies lead to improved consumer satisfaction positive evaluations of a retailers\\u2019 PDSQ in the case of a stockout in an omni-channel retail setting. This manuscript integrates the discussed streams of literature and addresses the research gaps outlined above by: (1) extending the conversation of stockouts into an omni-channel retail environment and (2) investigating which omni-channel fulfillment operations are most advantageous to recovering consumer satisfaction and improving a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ perceptions after a stockout. Conceptual Framework   Equity theory (Adams 1965) posits that a consumer\\u2019s response derives from comparing their internal calculation of outcomes to inputs to the perceived ratio of an average consumer\\u2019s outcomes to inputs. Consumer dissatisfaction is than a perceived imbalance or inequity arising 122  from receiving a lower outcome than the average consumer, providing more inputs than the average consumer, or a combination of both (Oliver 1980). Therefore, according to equity theory, a consumer experiencing a stockout will receive a lower outcome than the average consumer which leads to an imbalance between a consumer\\u2019s ratio of outcomes to inputs and an average consumer\\u2019s ratio of outcomes to inputs. This imbalance, or perception of inequity, leads to consumer dissatisfaction (Kim and Lennon 2011; Pizzi and Scarpi 2013).  Research has positioned equity theory as an applicable lens to study consumer responses to service recoveries (e.g. Grewal et al. 2008; Smith et al. 1999; Roggeveen et al. 2012). This theory has also been applied to studying supply chain failures, such as late deliveries (Rao et al. 2011b) and supply chain recoveries, such as returns management (Griffis et al. 2012a).  Figure 1 was developed to guide this research and is based on the theoretical foundations of equity theory. In general, the framework for this research proposes that a fast and efficient recovery process impact satisfaction levels and PDSQ perceptions, with regard to a retailer\\u2019s omni-channel fulfillment operations aimed at restoring consumers\\u2019 perceived inequity after experiencing a stockout.  Figure 3: Framework  This research consists of four experimental studies including one pretest and three main studies. The pretest helped develop and refine the experimental stimuli for the main studies and 123  was used to ensure only the variables of interest were manipulated (Perdue and Summers 1986; Knemeyer and Naylor 2011).  Study 1   This study focuses on developing the foundational relationships between a timely and convenient stockout recovery on consumers\\u2019 equity perceptions. Based on these underlying relationships, Studies 2 and 3 enhance the baseline model, evaluate other consumer outcome variables, and introduces more sophisticated variations of the proposed relationships. Retail evaluations depend, at least partly, on different facets of the recovery process (Tax et al. 1998). For the purpose of this research, I am particularly concerned with the dimensions of speed and convenience. Speed refers to how fast the recovery strategy is (i.e. next day vs. 9 days) (Smith et al. 1999). Convenience is a nonmonetary attribute that refers to consumers designating limited effort in order to acquire a product (Berry et al. 2002). In this paper, convenience is defined as the location where an (formerly) unavailable product is delivered (i.e. the consumer\\u2019s home vs. the store).  Extant literature demonstrates that successful recovery strategies lead to enhanced consumer satisfaction (Allen et al. 2014; Roggeveen et al. 2012; Tax et al. 1998) and positive company evaluations (e.g. Maxham and Netemeyer 2002). These positive consumer responses result from repairing the consumers\\u2019 view of equity on the part of the retailer (e.g. Roggeveen et al. 2012). According to equity theory (Adams 1965), inequality can be restored either through matching or even exceeding the outcome or through minimizing the investment of additional inputs. In the case of a stockout, a retailer can match the outcome by offering consumers who experience a stockout the option of having the product provided through another channel, for instance. During the stockout recovery process, the consumer is likely to 124  invest additional time and effort until the unavailable product is received. In accordance with equity theory (Adams 1965), the retailer should try to minimize the additional consumer inputs, such as time and effort to rectify perceived equity imbalances. For example, a retailer could provide a fast recovery to minimize consumer waiting times. The literature suggests a fast recovery is perceived as \\u201cfairer\\u201d by consumers in comparison to a slow recovery (Hart et al. 1990; Smith et al. 1999). In a stockout situation, a retailer has the opportunity to leverage its omni-channel fulfillment operations to provide a fast recovery from the failure in the primary retail channel by delivering the unavailable product through another channel thereby minimizing the time a consumer invests waiting for the product. Hence, consumers are more likely to have higher equity perceptions when the recovery is fast than when it is slow.  Similarly, a retailer could offer delivering the unavailable product to a more convenient location to minimize the additional effort a consumer invests during the recovery process. In a stockout situation, a retailer has the opportunity to leverage its omni-channel fulfillment operations to have the (formerly) unavailable product delivered to a more convenient location and thus, minimize the additional effort consumers invest during the recovery process (Berry et al. 2002). Hence, consumers are likely to have higher equity perceptions when the product is delivered to a more convenient location than when it is delivered to a less convenient location. Thus, I hypothesize: H1a: A speedy (slow) recovery leads to a higher (lower) levels of perceived equity. H1b: A more convenient (less convenient) location leads higher (lower) levels of perceived equity.  125  While speed and convenience, when considered individually, are likely to lead to higher perceptions of equity, the complete recovery strategy should be seen as a bundle of resources (Smith et al. 1999). According to equity theory (Adams 1965), equity can be achieved by minimizing the additional inputs, in terms of time and effort, a consumer invests in the recovery process. Minimizing additional inputs can be achieved by providing a speedy recovery and having the product delivered to a more convenient location. Building on the discussion of H1a and H1b, I would predict that a slow recovery speed is likely to lead to low equity perceptions because the consumer will have to invest more time. However when considering speed and convenience as a bundle of resources, a consumer\\u2019s overall additional inputs can be minimized by the retailer and equity can be approximated by offering a more convenient delivery location since consumers. Accordingly, the consumer will invest less effort overall even when the recovery is slow.  Similar logic applies when the product is delivered to a less convenient location. Again, delivering a product to a less convenient location increases consumers\\u2019 time input. However, considering speed and convenience as a bundle of recovery resources (Smith et al. 1999), having a speedy recovery but delivering the product to a less convenient location is likely to be perceived as more equitable because overall, the consumer will have to invest less additional time during the recovery process. Since, perceived equity depends on how consumers interpret the entire recovery process in terms of speed and convenience, I hypothesize:  H2a: When recovery speed is slow, having the product delivered to a more convenient location will lead to higher levels of perceived equity than when the product is delivered to a less convenient location  H2b: When the product is delivered to a less convenient location, a fast recovery will lead to higher levels of perceived equity than a slow recovery.  126  Pretest Before the hypotheses were tested in Study 1, a pretest was conducted to ensure the validity of our experimental manipulations. For the pretest, I developed a hypothetical shopping scenario following the guidelines of Rungtusanatham et al. (2011). In the pre-design stage, I consulted in-store policies of omni-channel retailers to explore the different fulfillment options stores typically provide to consumers in the case of a stockout. Based on this review, I identified those retailers who deliver products to a consumer\\u2019s home or to the store. Additionally, retailers differ depending on their speediness of delivery (i.e. next day or 9 days). Once I identified these key factors, I developed the written version of the hypothetical shopping scenario. This step involved the careful development of a common and experimental module (Rungtusanatham et al. 2011). The common module included all the statements that are constant across all groups and the experimental module included all the statements that varied across experimental groups. The final experimental conditions were reviewed by a total of six experts. Integrating their feedback into the experiment enhanced the instructions and scenario clarity. The final experiment for the pretest was a 2 (Convenience: delivered to the home vs. to the store) x 2 (Speed: next day delivery vs. 9 days delivery) between subjects design, including one control group.  A total of 170 students (61.8% male; mean age of 23.12 years) were recruited from five different business courses at a large, public university in the southern United States. Participants received course credit in exchange for participating in the pretest. All participants were randomly assigned (Bachrach and Bendoly 2011; Knemeyer and Naylor 2011) to one of the five experimental conditions. 127  To evaluate convenience and speed among the different groups, I excluded our control group from the analysis. I conducted a MANOVA with convenience and speed as the dependent variables, both measured on a 7-point Likert-scale (1=strongly disagree; 7=strongly agree), and \\u201cto where\\u201d the product was delivered (home vs. the store) and \\u201cwhen\\u201d the product was delivered (next day vs. 9 days delivery) as the independent variables. There is a significant main effect for \\u201cto where\\u201d on convenience, F(1,126) =56.34, p<0.001, \\u019e2=0.31, indicating that when the product is delivered to the consumer\\u2019s home (Mhome= 6.27) participants evaluate this as being more convenient than if the product is delivered to the store (Mstore= 4.21). The main effect for \\u201cwhen\\u201d on convenience was not significant. There is also a significant main effect for \\u201cwhen\\u201d on speed, F(1,126) =109.20, p<0.001, \\u019e2=0.47, indicating that when the product is delivered the next day (Mnext_day = 2.58), participants evaluate this as having to wait less than if the product is delivered in 9 days (M9_days = 5.58). The main effect for \\u201cwhere\\u201d on speed was not significant at the \\u03b1 = 0.05 level. No significant interaction effects were observed. To evaluate whether participants were aware of their respective experimental condition, a contingency table analysis was conducted (Bachrach and Bendoly 2011; Perdue and Summers 1986). The large effect sizes for the convenience condition with \\u03c72=63.36, p<0.001, Cramer\\u2019s V=0.65 and the speed condition with \\u03c72=74.330 p<0.001, Cramer\\u2019s V=0.70 indicate most of the participants were able to identify their respective groups, which supports the validity of our manipulations (Miller 2002).  Study 1: Method Study 1 constituted a 2 (Convenience: delivered to the home vs. to the store) x 2 (Speed: next day delivery vs. 9 days delivery) between subjects design, including one control group and a total of 222 adults from the U.S. participated in the web-based survey via Amazon 128  Mechanical Turk (MTurk) (Knemeyer and Naylor 2011; Goodman et al. 2013). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the five experimental conditions. The age range of the sample is from 18 to 73, with a mean age of 35.4 years, and approximately 65% of the participants were female. The median combined household income was $40,000 - $49,999, and about 87% reported at least some college education.  Study 1: Dependent variables and manipulation check measures The outcome variable of interest in Study 1 was \\u201cequity\\u201d (Smith et al. 1999) consisting of three dimensions: distributive (which evaluates the outcome), procedural (which evaluates the process in which the outcome is achieved), and interactional equity (which refers to employees behavior). Appendix A provides a detailed overview of the item descriptions.  To assess whether participants were aware of their respective treatment condition, two one-item measures were used asking participants to indicate to where the tablet would be delivered (to the home or to the store) and when the tablet would be delivered (the next day or in 9 days). Additionally, an instructional manipulation check (Oppenheimer et al. 2009) was included at the end of the survey to ensure that participant were aware of the instructions. Study 1: Manipulation checks To assess whether participants were aware of their respective experimental conditions (Perdue and Summers 1986; Bachrach and Bendoly 2011), two-way contingency table analyses were conducted. The significance and large effect sizes (Cramer\\u2019s V=0.943 and 0.977; convenience and speed, respectively) are in line with pretest 1 and hence, confirm the validity of our experimental manipulations (Miller 2002).  129  Study 1: Analysis and results  To test H1a, H1b, H2a, and H2b a two-way ANOVA was conducted with speed (next day vs. 9 days) and convenience (home vs. store) as fixed effects and equity was included as the dependent variable. The analysis shows that there is a significant main effect of speed (F(1,176)=7.68; p<0.01, \\u03b72 = 0.04) on equity, indicating that consumers exhibit higher perceptions of equity if the recovery is fast (Mfast = 6.05) rather than slow (Mslow = 5.45). Thus, H1a is supported. The main effect of convenience is not significant at the 0.05 level, (F(1,176)=5.49; p=0.053; \\u03b72 = 0.02). Thus, H1b is only partially supported. No significant interaction effect was revealed.  To test H2a and H2b I build on the ANOVA results by conducting pairwise comparisons of convenience on equity when the recovery speed is slow and speed on equity when the delivery location is less convenient. The results show that for the slow recovery condition, convenience does not enhance perceptions of equity (p = 0.240; Mhome = 5.70, Mstore = 5.40). Thus, H2a is not supported. For the condition when the product is delivered to a less convenient location, speed significantly enhances perceptions of equity (p = 0.08; Mnextday = 5.84, M9days = 5.40). Thus, H2b is partially supported. Study 1: Discussion  The findings of Study 1 suggest that providing a fast recovery is more essential to achieving higher perceptions of equity than providing a more convenient delivery location. The finding that the recovery attribute of convenience has, in general, only a limited effect on perceptions of equity further supports this interpretation.  130   Although these findings provide some insights into which attributes of an omni-channel fulfillment operations may impact consumer perceptions of equity, this study has its limitations. Study 1 does not consider other relevant consumer related outcome variables such as satisfaction or perceptions of a retailer\\u2019s service quality. Thus, Study 2 introduces post-recovery satisfaction and physical distribution service quality as two new outcome variables. Furthermore, Study 2 will provide insights into the underlying processes of \\u201cwhy\\u201d consumers experience post-recovery satisfaction and positive evaluations of a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ. Building on Study 1, it seems to be the case that consumers evaluate different recovery attributes as more \\u201cequitable\\u201d (fairer) which in turn might then lead to heightened satisfaction levels.  Study 2    This study investigates whether consumers\\u2019 post-recovery satisfaction levels and perceptions of a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ are indirectly impacted through their perceptions of equity. Equity theory suggests that a consumer\\u2019s recovery evaluation is a function of previously developed perceptions of equity (Adams 1965). These perceptions subsequently translates into enhanced consumer satisfaction (Roggeveen et al. 2012) and positive attitudes (Oliver 1980). Applied to our conceptual model, consumers with high equity perceptions (due to a fast or more convenient recovery) will be more satisfied and will have higher perceptions of PDSQ than consumers with low levels of perceived equity (due to a slow or less convenient recovery). For example, Roggeveen et al. (2012) provide evidence that equity is the underlying mechanism that restores satisfaction in a recovery involving consumer co-creation. I therefore postulate:  H3: The relationship between speed and convenience and satisfaction and PDSQ is mediated by perceived equity, such that: 131  H3a: Consumers experiencing a fast recovery will be more satisfied and have higher PDSQ perceptions than consumers experiencing a slow recovery, due to higher equity perceptions H3b: Consumers having the product delivered to a more convenient location will be more satisfied and have higher PDSQ perceptions than consumers having the product delivered to a less convenient location, due to higher equity perceptions. H3c: When recovery speed is slow, having the product delivered to a more convenient location will lead to higher levels of satisfaction and perceived PDSQ than when the product is delivered to a less convenient location, due to higher perceived equity. H3d: When the product is delivered to a less convenient location, a faster recovery will lead to higher levels of satisfaction and perceived PDSQ than a slow recovery, due to higher perceived equity. Study 2: Method Study 2 also constituted of a 2 (Convenience: delivered to the home vs. to the store) x 2 (Speed: next day delivery vs. 9 days delivery) between subjects design, including one control group. A total of 261 adults from the U.S. participated in the web-based survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) (Knemeyer and Naylor 2011; Goodman et al. 2013). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the five experimental conditions. The age range of the sample was from 19 to 76, with a mean age of 36.6 years, and approximately 65.7% of the participants were female. The median combined household income was $40,000 - $49,999, and about 91% reported at least some college education.  Study 2: Dependent variables and manipulation check measures The dependent variables in Study 2 are post-recovery satisfaction (Crosby and Stephens 1987) and the participant\\u2019s perception of a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ (Koufteros et al. 2014). A retailer\\u2019s PDSQ is operationalized as having three dimensions: timeliness, availability, and condition. The measures were adapted from extant research. Timeliness refers to whether the product 132  would be delivered on time; availability refers to whether the retailer is able to provide the product when requested; and, condition refers to whether the product will arrive in good condition. Appendix A provides a detailed overview of the two scales used to measure the dependent variables.  Study 2: Convergent and discriminant validity assessments  Convergent and discriminant validity of the dependent measures were assessed through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using AMOS 22.0 for SPSS. A five-factor model, including satisfaction, timeliness, availability, condition, and equity was estimated. Equity was estimated as a second factor model consisting of three dimensions: distributive, procedural, and interactional equity. The CFA fit statistics support our model (Hu and Bentler 1999): \\u03c72 = 1175.35, df = 392, CFI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.088 (90% confidence interval: 0.082; 0.093), and SRMR=0.043.  In support of convergent validity the average-variance extracted (AVE) for each factor exceeds 0.5 (Fornell and Larcker 1981). Moreover, all Cronbach\\u2019s alpha (\\u03b1) values exceed 0.8 (Nunally and Bernstein 1994). In support of discriminant validity for each pair of factors, the AVE exceeded the phi-square correlation (\\u02782) (Fornell and Larcker 1981). Table 1 provides a summary of the standardized loadings and Cronbach\\u2019s \\u03b1.     133  Table 1: CFA results Study 2 Item Standardized loading Cronbach\\u2019s \\u03b1 Equity1_distributive 0.97 0.98 Equity2_procedural 0.99  Equity3_interactional 0.93  Sat1 0.98 0.97 Sat2 0.95  Sat3 0.92  Time1 0.94 0.93 Time2 0.96  Time3 0.97  Time4 0.82  Time5 0.89  Time6 0.50  Avail1 0.90 0.94 Avail2 0.89  Avail3 0.88  Avail4 0.84  Avail5 0.81  Cond1 0.92 0.91 Cond2 0.96  Cond3 0.90  Cond4 0.64   Note: \\u03c72 = 1175.35, df = 392, CFI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.088 (90% CI: 0.082; 0.093), SRMR=0.043        134  Study 2: Manipulation checks Two-way contingency table analyses were conducted to assess whether participants were aware of their respective experimental conditions (Perdue and Summers 1986; Bachrach and Bendoly 2011). The significant and large effect sizes (Cramer\\u2019s V=0.905 and 0.960 for convenience and speed respectively) of the manipulation checks are in line with pretest 1 and Study 1. Hence, the validity of our experimental manipulations are confirmed (Miller 2002). Study 2: Analysis and results  To assess whether equity would function as a mediator between the recovery attributes and the dependent variables of interest I used PROCESS. PROCESS is a set of newly established SPSS macros and is based on an ordinary least square regression path analysis. These macros are suitable to estimate different types of statistical models, including simple mediation and moderation models as well as more advanced moderated-mediation models (Hayes 2013). I ran PROCESS model 4 and 8 (Hayes 2013), which resembles a simple mediation model and an advanced moderated-mediation model. Contrary to the traditional view of Baron and Kenny (1986) who require a significant relationship between the independent and dependent variable to test for mediation, PROCESS adopts a more contemporary approach. PROCESS establishes mediation based on the only criteria that a significant indirect effect of X on Y through a mediating variable M (a x b) exists (Zhao et al. 2010; Hayes 2009). Thus, it is not necessary to first establish a significant relationship between the X and Y variables to test for a mediation effect. To assess the significance of indirect effects PROCESS uses bootstrap confidence intervals (If 0 is not included in the estimated confidence interval of the indirect effect, mediation can be inferred).  135   First, I estimated a simple mediation model (PROCESS model 4) with speed as the sole predictor. The results show that equity functions as a mediator between speed on satisfaction (effect size: 0.41, Lower Limit: 0.13 and Upper Limit: 0.69) since 0 is not include in the bootstrap confidence interval. It can be inferred that consumers indicate significantly higher satisfaction levels when the product is delivered the next day vs. in 9 days, due to higher perceived equity. This finding is in line with Study 1. Similarly, equity also functions as a mediator between speed and timeliness (effect size: 0.33, Lower Limit: 0.10 and Upper Limit: 0.58), availability (effect size: 0.21, Lower Limit: 0.08 and Upper Limit: 0.41), condition (effect size: 0.15, Lower Limit: 0.06 and Upper Limit: 0.26), and overall PDSQ (effect size: 0.23, Lower Limit: 0.03 and Upper Limit: 0.34) indicating that consumers evaluate a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ significantly higher when the product is delivered the next day vs. in 9 days, due to higher perceptions of equity. Based on these results, H3a is supported.   Next, I estimated a simple mediation model with convenience as the sole predictor. Results indicate that equity does not mediate the relationship between convenience on satisfaction (effect size: 0.25, Lower Limit: -0.05 and Upper Limit: 0.58), timeliness (effect size: 0.21, Lower Limit: -0.04 and Upper Limit: 0.48), availability (effect size: 0.13, Lower Limit: -0.02 and Upper Limit: 0.34), condition (effect size: 0.09, Lower Limit: -0.02 and Upper Limit: 0.21), or overall PDSQ (effect size: 0.14, Lower Limit: -0.04 and Upper Limit: 0.33) since 0 is included in the respective bootstrap confidence intervals. Thus, H3b is not supported. Table 2 summarizes the results of the simple mediation models.   136  Table 2: PROCESS model 4 Hypothesis Relationship Indirect Effect CI H3a S-> Equity-> SAT a*b (0.40*1.03)=0.41 (0.13; 0.69)* H3a S-> Equity->Timeliness a*b (0.40*0.84)=0.33 (0.10; 0.58)* H3a S-> Equity->Availability a*b (0.40*0.54)=0.21 (0.08; 0.41)* H3a S-> Equity->Condition a*b (0.40*0.37)=0.15 (0.06; 0.27)* H3a S-> Equity-> PDSQ a*b (0.40*0.58)=0.23 (0.06; 0.34)* H3b C-> Equity-> SAT a*b (0.24*1.03)=0.25 (-0.05; 0.58) H3b C-> Equity-> Timeliness a*b (0.24*0.88)=0.21 (-0.04; 0.48) H3b C-> Equity-> Availability a*b (0.24*0.56)=0.13 (-0.02; 0.34) H3b C-> Equity-> Condition a*b (0.24*0.38)=0.09 (-0.02; 0.21) H3b C-> Equity-> PDSQ a*b (0.24*0.61)=0.14 (-0.04; 0.33) Note: * significant since 0 is not included in the 95% Bootstrap confidence interval   Furthermore, I estimated a mediation model with speed and convenience as the two predictors to test H3c and H3d. Results indicate that contrary to our predictions, when recovery is slow, equity does not function as a mediator. Accordingly, having the product delivered to a more convenient location does not significantly improve post-recovery satisfaction (effect size: 0.38, Lower Limit: -0.07 and Upper Limit: 0.85), timeliness (effect size: 0.31, Lower Limit: -0.07 and Upper Limit: 0.68), availability (effect size: 0.20, Lower Limit: -0.01 and Upper Limit: 0.47), condition (effect size: 0.14, Lower Limit: -0.03 and Upper Limit: 0.33), or overall perceptions of PDSQ (effect size: 0.22, Lower Limit: -0.04 and Upper Limit: 0.48). Thus, H3c is not supported. However, in support of H3d, our results show that when the product is delivered to a less convenient location (store), having a fast recovery does lead to significantly higher levels of satisfaction (effect size: 0.55, Lower Limit: 0.16 and Upper Limit: 0.97), 137  timeliness (effect size: 0.45, Lower Limit: 0.09 and Upper Limit: 0.81), availability (effect size: 0.29, Lower Limit: 0.10 and Upper Limit: 0.57), condition (effect size: 0.20, Lower Limit: 0.06 and Upper Limit: 0.36), and overall perceptions of PDSQ (effect size: 0.31, Lower Limit: 0.07 and Upper Limit: 0.57) due to higher perceptions of equity.

The data shows that when the product is delivered to a less convenient location higher satisfaction levels and higher perceptions of a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ are due to higher levels of equity. Moreover, higher levels of 138  equity can be achieved by providing a fast recovery. Hence, it can be concluded that if a retailer does not have the capabilities to deliver the product to a more convenient location, speed might be of essence to achieving higher satisfaction levels and PDSQ perceptions.  While the findings of Study 2 shed some light on the importance of a fast vs. convenient recovery after a stockout, this study has its limitations. It was specifically surprising that some of the findings were contrary to the predictions based on equity theory. Hence, to further contribute to theory (Whetten 2009), I contextualized equity theory in Study 3 by considering a different shopping context.  Study 1 and subsequent Study 2 implemented a low purchase criticality scenario (i.e. temporal feelings of involvement that accompany a consumer during a particular shopping situation (Richins et al. 1992)) and, hence, provided only limited insights into consumers\\u2019 responses to stockout recoveries. It is suggested that depending on the shopping context (i.e. low vs. high purchase criticality) consumers will evaluate an omni-channel retailer\\u2019s stockout recovery strategies differently. These limitations will be addressed in Study 3 by integrating a high purchase criticality scenario into the experimental design. Study 3  This study introduces purchase criticality and explores the boundary conditions of the proposed model. Within the context of retailing, purchase criticality or situational involvement is defined as the temporal feelings of involvement that accompany a consumer during a particular shopping situation (Richins et al. 1992). Extant literature has established, for example, that buying a gift for a friend results in higher purchase criticality compared to buying a product for oneself (Clarke and Belk 1979). Also, the criticality of a purchase (i.e. whether it is needed vs. not needed) has been shown to be an important factor when assessing 139  consumer responses to stockout recovery strategies (Zinn and Liu 2008, 2001). Accordingly, shopping situations that carry a high level of perceived risk or are, highly critical purchases are associated with higher levels of perceived consumer risk (Ostrom and Iacobbuci 1995).  The service failure literature provides evidence that consumers perceive a service failure as being more severe during high purchase criticality than during low purchase criticality (e.g. Ostrom and Iacobucci 1995; Levesque and McDougall 2009). This suggests that providing a faster and more convenient recovery from a stockout, particularly within high purchase criticality, is important to restoring equity and consequently achieving high levels of consumer satisfaction and perceptions of a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ.  Study 3: Method Study 3 implemented a 2 (Convenience: delivered to the home vs. to the store) x 2 (Speed: next day delivery vs. 9 days delivery) between subjects design considering a high purchase criticality context. A control group with a low purchase criticality context was integrated into the experimental design. The low purchase criticality scenario asked participants to imagine they are buying a tablet for themselves whereas the high purchase criticality scenario prompted participants to imagine they are buying a tablet as a birthday gift for their spouse. A total of 274 adults from the U.S. participated in the web-based survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) (Knemeyer and Naylor 2011; Goodman et al. 2013). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the eight experimental conditions. The age range of the sample was from 19 to 74, with a mean age of 33.9 years, and approximately 50% of the participants were female. The median combined household income was $40,000 - $49,999, and about 90.5% reported at least some college education.  140  Study 3: Dependent variables and manipulation check measures The dependent variables and manipulation check measures were identical to the ones from Study 1 and Study 2. As a new manipulation check measure for purchase criticality, Study 3 included the 20-item bipolar personal involvement inventory scale (Zaichkowsky 1994). Study 3: Convergent and discriminant validity assessments  Convergent and discriminant validity of the dependent measures was assessed through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using AMOS 22.0 for SPSS. A five-factor model, including satisfaction, timeliness, availability, condition, and equity was estimated. Equity was estimated as a second factor model consisting of three dimensions: distributive, procedural, and interactional equity. The CFA fit statistics support our model (Hu and Bentler 1999): \\u03c72 = 1160.28, df = 392, CFI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.085 (90% confidence interval: 0.079; 0.090), and SRMR=0.042.  In support of convergent validity the average-variance extracted (AVE) for each factor exceeds 0.5 (Fornell and Larcker 1981). Moreover, all Cronbach\\u2019s alpha (\\u03b1) values exceed 0.8 (Nunally and Bernstein 1994). In support of discriminant validity for each pair of factors, the AVE exceeded the phi-square correlation (\\u02782) (Fornell and Larcker 1981). Table 4 provides a summary of the standardized loadings and Cronbach\\u2019s \\u03b1.    141  Table 4: CFA results Study 3 Item Standardized loading Cronbach\\u2019s \\u03b1 Equity1_distributive 0.98 0.97 Equity2_procedural 0.98  Equity3_interactional 0.90  Sat1 0.92 0.96 Sat2 0.95  Sat3 0.97  Time1 0.95 0.93 Time2 0.94  Time3 0.96  Time4 0.85  Time5 0.92  Time6 0.42  Avail1 0.87 0.95 Avail2 0.93  Avail3 0.90  Avail4 0.85  Avail5 0.87  Cond1 0.95 0.93 Cond2 0.94  Cond3 0.91  Cond4 0.71   Note: \\u03c72 = 1160.28, df = 392, CFI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.085 (90% CI: 0.079; 0.090), SRMR=0.042  Study 3: Manipulation checks Two-way contingency table analyses were conducted to assess whether participants were aware of their respective experimental conditions (Perdue and Summers 1986; Bachrach and Bendoly 2011). The significant and large effect sizes for convenience and speed (Cramer\\u2019s 142  V=0.923 and 0.949), respectively are in line with prior studies and hence, confirm the validity of our experimental manipulations (Miller 2002). Additionally, a one-way ANOVA was conducted to check whether there is a significant difference between the low and high purchase criticality groups. The results indicate that the high purchase criticality condition leads to higher purchase criticality evaluations (Mhigh_criticality = 5.56) than the low purchase criticality condition (Mlow_criticality = 5.17) with F(1,273) = 14.55 , p < 0.01, \\u03b72 = 0.05. Study 3: Analysis and results  I replicated the analysis of Study 2, to assess whether the predictions in terms of speed and convenience on satisfaction and PDSQ would also hold in a high purchase criticality context. Table 5 and Table 6 summarize the results.

The results show that equity functions as a mediator between speed and satisfaction (effect size: 1.04, Lower Limit: 0.60 and Upper Limit: 1.50) since 0 is not included in the bootstrap confidence interval. It can be inferred that consumers indicate significantly higher satisfaction levels when the product was delivered the next day vs. in 9 days, due to higher perceived equity which is in line with the findings of Study 2. Similarly, equity also functions as a mediator between speed and timeliness (effect size: 0.84, Lower Limit: 0.52 and Upper Limit: 1.15), availability (effect size: 0.72, Lower Limit: 0.42 and Upper Limit: 1.04), condition (effect size: 0.54, Lower Limit: 0.33 and Upper Limit: 0.79), and overall PDSQ (effect size: 0.72, Lower Limit: 0.43 and Upper Limit: 1.00) indicating that consumers evaluate a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ significantly higher when the product is delivered the next day vs. in 9 days, 144  due to higher perceptions of equity. Based on these results, H3a is supported considering a high purchase criticality context.   Next, I estimated a simple mediation model with convenience as the sole predictor. Results indicate that equity does mediate the relationship between convenience and satisfaction (effect size: 0.60, Lower Limit: 0.21 and Upper Limit: 1.02), timeliness (effect size: 0.54, Lower Limit: 0.19 and Upper Limit: 0.93), availability (effect size: 0.43, Lower Limit: 0.15 and Upper Limit: 0.77), condition (effect size: 0.33, Lower Limit: 0.12 and Upper Limit: 0.58), and overall PDSQ (effect size: 0.50, Lower Limit: 0.16 and Upper Limit: 0.78) since 0 is not included in both bootstrap confidence intervals. This finding is in line with the predictions but contrary to the findings considering a low purchase criticality context. Thus, H3b is supported considering a high purchase criticality context.  Furthermore, I estimated a mediation model with speed and convenience as the two predictors to test H3c and H3d. In line with the predictions, the results indicate that when recovery is slow, equity does function as a mediator. Hence, having the product delivered to a more convenient location does significantly improve post-recovery satisfaction (effect size: 0.97, Lower Limit: 0.36 and Upper Limit: 1.62), timeliness (effect size: 0.80, Lower Limit: 0.25 and Upper Limit: 1.36), availability (effect size: 0.70, Lower Limit: 0.26 and Upper Limit: 1.29), condition (effect size: 0.51, Lower Limit: 0.17 and Upper Limit: 0.93), and overall PDSQ (effect size: 0.69, Lower Limit: 0.28 and Upper Limit: 1.26) due to higher equity perceptions. Thus, H3c is supported considering a high purchase criticality context. In support of H3d, the results show that when the product is delivered to a less convenient location (store), having a fast recovery does lead to significantly higher levels of satisfaction (effect size: 1.37, Lower Limit: 0.76 and Upper Limit: 1.97), timeliness (effect size: 1.13, Lower Limit: 0.66 and 145  Upper Limit: 1.65), availability (effect size: 0.98, Lower Limit: 0.56 and Upper Limit: 1.56), condition (effect size: 0.72, Lower Limit: 0.43 and Upper Limit: 1.11), and overall PDSQ (effect size: 0.97, Lower Limit: 0.55 and Upper Limit: 1.39) due to higher perceptions of equity.  Study 3: Discussion  Study 3 highlights the importance of the shopping context (i.e. purchase criticality) when recovering from a stockout. The results provide insights into the appropriateness of using equity theory to investigate stockout recovery. While in Study 2, which considered a low purchase criticality context, not all findings followed the predictions according to equity theory but when, considering a high purchase criticality context the results were in line with the predictions (Study 3). Thus, equity theory seems to be a better theoretical lens to predict consumer responses to failure recovery when purchase criticality is high. In addition, it seems to be more important to consider recovery attributes as bundles of recovery resources under a high purchase criticality context and its associated higher risk (Smith et al. 1999). While having the product delivered to a more convenient location vs. a less convenient location the data did not evidence significantly improve satisfaction or PDSQ levels when the recovery speed was low considering a low purchase criticality context. However, in a high purchase criticality convenience does have a significant and positive effect on satisfaction and PDSQ levels.  General Discussion and Implications  When considered as a whole, the three studies offer interesting insights especially pertaining to the role that equity plays in affecting post-recovery satisfaction and consumer 146  evaluations of a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ. While the findings of this research, in general, indicate that consumers are more likely to have positive post-recovery satisfaction levels and evaluations of a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ due to higher perceptions of equity after a stockout, this might only apply to specific cases. In Study 2 (low purchase criticality) I showed that, in general, equity mediates the relationship between a fast recovery and satisfaction and consumer perceptions of a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ. However, in a low purchase criticality context, the data did not indicate convenience would enhance satisfaction levels and perceptions of PDSQ when the recovery is slow, which was contrary to the predictions based on equity theory. This suggests that convenience plays a less important role in affecting post-recovery consumer perceptions in a low purchase criticality context. Also, in a low purchase criticality context and with its associated low risk, simply providing a fast recovery might be evaluated as \\u201cfair\\u201d enough leading to higher satisfaction levels and perceptions of PDSQ. However, in the case of a high purchase criticality context which is associated with high risk, retailers should invest more effort in the recovery process by considering speed and convenience as a bundle of resources for the recovery process. Taken together the studies provide insights under which conditions equity serves as an important driver and thus, highlights how consumers perceive specific omni-channel fulfillment attributes when utilized to recover from a stockout situation. Theoretical Implications and Future Research This research makes several important contributions to the literature (see Table 7 for a summary). This manuscript spans the research areas of operations and marketing by investigating how omni-channel fulfillment operations can impact consumer perceptions. Specifically, through a series of experiments I highlight the importance of a retailer\\u2019s omni-channel fulfillment operations for service recovery within an omni-channel retail environment. 147  More precisely, I show how omni-channel fulfillment operations can be used to recover from a stockout situation. Thus, this research specifically contributes to the growing literature stream associated with consumer issues in operations and supply chain management, which stresses the importance of operations management in creating end-consumer value (Flint and Mentzer 2006).  Table 7: Summary of contributions to the literature Current Literature Contribution to the Literature Call for more integrated investigations of managerial processes in both marketing and operations/supply chain management (e.g. Esper et al. 2010; Stank et al. 2012; J\\u00fcttner et al. 2007). Provides insights for stockout recovery situations and highlights the importance of research at the intersection of operations/supply chain management and marketing. Research investigates behavioral responses to service failures more generally (e.g. Kelley 1993, Roggeven 2012). Considers PDSQ as an outcome variable to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how various consumer market segments perceive a retailers omni-channel fulfillment operations in the case of a stockout recovery.  Provides a deeper understanding of the role omni-channel fulfillment operations for a service failure recovery. Consumer response to out-of-stock research has predominantly focused on single channel retailing (e.g. Zinn and Liu 2001, 2008, Peinkofer et al. 2015). Extends the consumer response to out-of-stock literature by considering the new omni-channel environment.                                                     Equity theory has been shown to be appropriate to study service failure recovery in marketing (e.g. Grewal et al. 2008; Smith et al. 1999; Roggeveen et al. 2012).  Provides evidence for the suitability of equity theory to explore stockout recovery. Identifies a boundary condition of equity theory since the theory is does only explain higher satisfaction and positive evaluations of a retailer's PDSQ for specific \\\"bundles\\\" of recovery attributes.   From a theoretical perspective, I was able to show that equity is the driving force behind restoring post-recovery satisfaction levels and achieving positive consumer perceptions 148  of a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ. More specifically, I was able to show that depending on the bundle of recovery attributes and the shopping context, equity might or might not be the driving force impacting consumers\\u2019 post-recovery evaluations. Consumers are likely to evaluate different recovery strategies as being more or less \\u201cfair\\u201d. Supported by the findings of this research, some recovery strategies do not significantly impact consumers\\u2019 fairness perceptions and hence, their satisfaction and evaluations of a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ. For example, I failed to show that equity mediates the relationship between convenience on satisfaction and PDSQ when purchase criticality is low. In addition, purchase criticality may present a boundary condition of equity theory and future research is needed to firmly establish these boundary conditions. For example, future research should explore why equity theory seems to be more appropriate when explaining consumer responses to stockout recovery when the purchase criticality is high. Conversely, research is also needed to better understand why in a low purchase criticality convenience does not have a significant impact on satisfaction levels and PDSQ evaluations. Additionally, this research contributes to the literature that investigates how consumers respond to stockouts. Historically, this body of work has exclusively focused on exploring consumer responses to stockouts in a single channel setting (e.g. Zinn and Liu 2008; Pizzi and Scarpi 2013). However, with the emergence of omni-channel retailing, firms now have new options in how they handle stockouts. This research extends the current understandings of consumer responses to stockouts by considering supply chain focused psychological variables in an omni-channel retail context. Specifically, by introducing PDSQ as an outcome variable, this study further enhances prior research investigating how consumers evaluate a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ capabilities to the contextual setting of a stockout recovery. 149   While considering supply chain-focused psychological variables provides insight into how consumers evaluate an omni-channel retailer\\u2019s fulfillment operations, it does not provide insights into actual consumer behaviors. Thus, future research should integrate actual consumer behaviors to see how stockout recovery strategies influence other important variables, such as shopping frequency and average money spent on subsequent shopping trips.  Furthermore, this research considered how omni-channel retailers can leverage recovery attributes from a stockout in a brick-and-mortar environment and thus, the findings might not be generalizable to online stockouts. Since stockouts are also likely to occur within the online retail environment, future research should investigate which recovery attributes are most effective to recover from an online stockout. For consumers experiencing a stockout in a brick-and-mortar store a fast recovery seems to be essential in improving satisfaction levels but consumers experiencing an online stockout might prefer different recovery attributes and evaluate a fast recovery as less important since they were already willing to wait for the product to be shipped.  However, this research only considered two different recovery attributes (speed and convenience). Based on prior findings (Forrester Research, Inc. 2014), recovery strategies that rely on shipping products tend to increase costs. This additional cost needs to be considered when developing and implementing a stockout recovery strategy. Therefore, future research should incorporate other important recovery attributes to allow a better assessment of how consumers evaluate an omni-channel retailer\\u2019s recovery efforts.   In addition, Esper et al. (2003) find that online consumer satisfaction levels might also be impacted by the selection of the 3PL carrier. Hence, future research might also want to 150  incorporate how brick-and-mortar consumers evaluate a retailers\\u2019 stockout recovery efforts based on the carrier selection delivering the product. Managerial Implications Within the omni-channel retail environment, consumers\\u2019 expectations around a retailer\\u2019s omni-channel capabilities are steadily increasing (Forrester Research, Inc. 2014). 45% of consumers indicate that in the case of a stockout they would very likely take advantage of having the unavailable product shipped to their home; however, only 21% indicated that they would be willing to have it shipped to the store (Forrester Research, Inc. 2014). It is important for managers to understand that not all recovery efforts are evaluated by consumers equally and will lead to positive post-recovery satisfaction levels. Managers need to gain an understanding of the recovery attributes that are most valued by their consumers in order to increase consumer satisfaction and evaluations of their PDSQ post-stockout. Thus, manager could use the insights from this research to determine which recovery strategies might be evaluated by their consumers as \\u201cfair\\u201d to ensure that after a stockout occurs and consumers experience dissatisfaction, satisfaction levels can be improved through offering the appropriate recovery strategy.  Also, Big Data and data analytics play an important role in implementing efficient and effective omni-channel fulfillment operations (Ferguson 2013). For example, Massey\\u2019s Professional Outfitters was able to improve its efficiency and customer service by consolidating all its data from various channels into one platform (Berthiaume 2015). Managers can now leverage insights from Big Data and predictive analytics to anticipate which consumers are in need (high purchase criticality) or not in need (low purchase criticality) for a product. The tools to make predictions about consumers\\u2019 purchase are emerging. For example, 151  Target was able to use consumer buying data to predict whether a female consumer was pregnant (Duhigg 2012). Knowing this type of information enables managers to adjust their stockout recovery strategy based on the consumers\\u2019 shopping context, ensuring that the \\u201cbest\\u201d recovery strategy is offered and post-recovery satisfaction levels are achieved.  For managers, this research shows that providing a fast stockout recovery is key in achieving higher post-recovery satisfaction levels and consumer perceptions of a retailer\\u2019s PDSQ. Hence, managers should prioritize their investments and developments in terms of their omni-channel fulfillment capabilities to offer a fast stockout recovery. Omni-channel retailers could develop a ship-from-store program to provide online consumers who experience a stockout with the desired product in a timely manner. For instance, in early 2013, Macy\\u2019s announced that it would be dedicating an additional 200 stores by the end of the year for the purpose of fulfilling online orders (Ryan 2014). And, in fact, 57% of retailers cite a shorter delivery time to customers as the most important reason for why these retailers would develop a ship-from-store program (Forrester, Inc. 2014).       152  References  Aastrup, J., and Kotzab, H. 2009. \\u201cAnalyzing out-of-Stock in Independent Grocery Stores: An Empirical Study.\\u201d International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management 37 (9): 765\\u201389.

Conclusion and Future Research                    160  This dissertation investigated and obtained a holistic understanding of the importance and impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations for successful retail supply chain management. By considering three different echelons in the supply chain (supplier, retailer, and consumer) and employing different methodological approaches each essay by itself provided interesting insights and contributions. However, taken as a whole, several grand findings and contributions of this dissertation to understanding omni-channel fulfillment operations emerged.    In a grand scheme this dissertation provides evidence that across the supply chain the impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations are mixed but interconnected. While some supply chain members (i.e. retailers and end-consumers) seem to benefit from omni-channel fulfillment operations overall, other supply chain members (i.e. suppliers) seem to be facing significant operational challenges. For example, in essay one, I was able to establish that at least some retailers financially and operationally benefit from omni-channel fulfillment operations, Furthermore, I showed that end-consumers and their individual shopping context also play an important role when investigating omni-channel fulfillment operations and should not be neglected. Specifically, this research revealed that, in the case of a stockout recovery, the perception of \\u201cfairness\\u201d is a driver of positive consumer evaluations of a retailer\\u2019s omni-channel fulfillment capabilities. However, essay two highlights the potential operational challenges that suppliers might experience when establishing omni-channel fulfillment capabilities.  Future research might therefore wish to explore another aspect of omni-channel fulfillment operations which spans across different members of the supply chain to further strengthen the mixed impacts. For example, it would be interesting to uncover how omni-161  channel returns management will impact the different supply chain members. While consumers might perceive a retailers omni-channel return capabilities as positive, retailers and suppliers alike might struggle with developing the appropriate processes leading to new tensions and operational challenges in the reverse retail supply chain.  In addition, this research indicates that it is essential for supply chain members to become operationally ambidextrous to succeed in the omni-channel retail environment. This research supports the notion that retailers and suppliers refine already established fulfillment operations while simultaneously establishing new fulfillment operations. In the case of the retailers, I was able to provide evidence that depending on the retail segment, retailers appear to demonstrate positive financial and operational performance outcomes due to being operationally ambidextrous. In a similar vein, suppliers also exhibit operationally ambidextrous tendencies. Within the context of drop-shipping, suppliers will refine existing operational activities while simultaneously developing new drop-shipping operations. Hence, this dissertation provides evidence of the existence and necessity of operational ambidexterity in two different research settings. This dissertation opens up the dialogue for more exploration of the operational ambidexterity phenomenon. The phenomenon is fairly new in the operations and supply chain management domain and has only received very limited attention. Future research will be necessary to shed even more light on the relationship of operational ambidexterity and performance. Specifically, future research might further investigate its impact on operational performance. While this research introduced operational performance as a new outcome variable, the statistical support was rather weak. Thus, future research might focus on studying when a firm might gain operational efficiencies from becoming operationally ambidextrous 162  and when not. Thus, specifically longitudinal research designs might be appropriate for future research endeavors. Building on the previous conversation, this dissertation also highlights that operational ambidexterity and the impacts thereof are more nuanced. For retailers, I was able to identify that the respective retail segments and their associated environmental characteristics play an important role for the potential positive impacts of operational ambidexterity on retail firm performance. Also, the availability of resources appeared to constitute an interesting boundary condition. In addition, from a more internal perspective drop-shipping volume might constitute a boundary condition specifically as it relates to how to manage operational ambidexterity. Hence, environmental factors and other firm characteristics may constitute important boundary conditions and warrant further exploration to gain a better understanding. It might be interesting to apply this research to other retail specific contexts and even other industries which are characterized by their individual environments. Also, more research is needed to better understand how operational ambidexterity is managed. While this research offers some new insights concerning the debate of structural integration or separation future research might consider additional conditions when it is more beneficial to structurally integrate or separate. This type of extension would allow to uncover additional nuances of the impacts of operational ambidexterity.  Moreover, this dissertation provides a more theoretical understanding of operational ambidexterity. While the limited operational ambidexterity literature has addressed the phenomenon from the perspective of theory testing, this dissertation employed an exploratory perspective to contribute to the understanding how operational ambidexterity is reached and managed. Specifically, this dissertation indicates that exploration needs to be \\u201ctriggered\\u201d by an 163  external event and that exploration eventually turns into exploitation. However, this finding is specific to the context of suppliers and drop-shipping and might differ depending on other contexts or supply chain members. Future research might for example focus on gaining more theoretical insights by focusing on retailers. Retailers are standing under the continuous pressure of meeting end-consumer expectations and hence, might exhibit a different patter of how to manage operational ambidexterity. Lastly, this dissertation stresses the importance of how operational activities create value to end-consumers. The literature only recently gained traction on considering the value that operations and supply chain management activities has on end-consumers. This notion will gain even more importance within the omni-channel retail environment, where not only retailers but also suppliers stand in direct contact with end-consumers. In particular, this dissertation highlights how different attributes (speed and convenience) of omni-channel fulfillment operations can lead to positive consumer evaluations in the case of a stockout recovery. Thus, this research contributes to the evolving dialogue on how consumer insights provide valuable insights for retail supply chain strategy.  More research is needed in the future to gain a better and more nuanced understanding of the value that consumer insights offer to retail supply chain strategy. This is especially important considering that supply chains are perceived to be consumer driven. Therefore, future research should explore additional supply chain and operations management activities and how these may create end-consumer value. For example, it might be interesting to investigate how omni-channel return management activities impact consumers.   164  VI. Appendix                             165          166   \",\n",

The integration of these different channels raises the question how to redefine the strategic marketing elements and the operations, as the two channels have different constraints and require different competences. This multi-channel retailing has major impacts on the operations and the supply-chain management. Order fulfillment for the customers using the different sales channels is a key challenge, as customers are directly impacted from the performance of this process. In this paper, we will highlight the different strategic elements and operational challenges to be addressed by a multi-channel retailer. In order to evaluate the match between a fulfillment system and a multi-channel business model, we propose a framework analyzing the overall performance of different fulfillment systems regarding the two dimensions customer expectations and economic performance.  Key Words: Multi-Channel, Retail, Fulfillment, Distribution \\u00a0RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  2  INTRODUCTION A growing number of traditional store-based retailers are becoming multi-channel retailers by opening an additional online-channel to offer their customers multiple ways of buying and interaction. At the same time, former pure online-retailers are opening stores or physical pick-up points to allow their customers physical interaction and product pick-up. Multi-channel retailing got primary attention principally in the field of multi-channel marketing (e.g. Wirtz, 2008). Marketing literature and scholarly research address multi-channel marketing mainly focusing on customer behavior on the one side (e.g. Venkatesan et al, 2007) and the conflicts between channels on the other side (e.g. Falk et al, 2007; Avery et al, 2009). Several authors (e.g. Schr\\u00f6der, 2005; Schobesberger, 2007; Heinemann 2008, 2009) analyze different multi-channel strategies and implications on a retailers' marketing mix.  Whereas operational implications of online retailing have received attention since the end of the 1990s (e.g. Turban et al, 2009; Swaminathan & Tayur, 2003), specific analysis of operational implications of multi-channel retailing remains scarce. Agatz et al (2008) reviewed the specific supply chain management issues of internet fulfillment in a multi-channel environment. They identified an important number of topics relevant for e-fulfillment, but recognized that there are only very few dedicated models on multi-channel retailing.  Multi-channel retailers with different business models are using different fulfillment systems to deliver the products to their customers: The online shop of the French retailer Fnac (cultural and electronics products), fnac.com, started its online activity completely separated from its store activity, with different warehouse locations and fulfillment organizations. They gradually integrated their logistics activities and are operating today a fully integrated warehouse, preparing deliveries for the stores as well as for the individual online customers. Tesco.com, the online shop of the major UK retailer Tesco, prepares the customer's orders exclusively in the Tesco store next to the customer (Smith & Sparks, 2009). So does monoprix.fr, the online shop of the French city-center supermarket chain Monoprix. These observations suggest that a specific multi-channel business model may induce a specific, most suitable fulfillment system. If this is the case, it should then be possible to evaluate how a fulfillment system fits a given business model.  RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  3  From an operational point of view, fulfillment systems have to be mainly time- and cost-efficient. From a strategic marketing point of view, the fulfillment system has to be able to meet the customers' expectations created by the chosen business model. We therefore propose to develop a qualitative framework to evaluate how a specific multi-channel fulfillment system matches the business model of multi-channel retailers both in terms of the expectations of their customers on the one hand and the economic performances on the other hand. This framework should serve as basis for further empirical studies. Our paper is organized in two parts: In the first part, we will highlight the main characteristics of multi-channel retailing and present the major elements of the retailers' strategy, the retail mix, which have to be adapted to a multi-channel retailing strategy. 1 We then will explore the specific operational challenges to be faced when operating a multi-channel activity.  This first part will be completed with the presentation of the five major multi-channel fulfillment systems used to deliver products to the customers. In the second part, we will propose a qualitative analysis framework in order to evaluate the overall performance of a given fulfillment system, combining the two dimensions 'customer expectations' and 'economic performance'. The parameters of the framework as well as its applications will be based on the analysis of the strategic and operational challenges developed in the first part. Applying the analysis framework to the five major fulfillment systems leads us to discuss how each of the systems impacts the different parameters. We conclude our paper presenting managerial implications and suggested future research avenues to provide evidence if our framework is valid for our purpose.  Methodology Our analysis is based on the one hand on our longitudinal industry observation of retailers' practices, completed with the analysis of company information and press articles. Moreover,                                                  1 In our paper, we will concentrate on multi-channel retailers operating at least several physical stores and an online sales channel under the same brand and with the same types of products. Moreover, we focus on the distribution of physical products, as dematerialized products do not need a physical distribution. We exclude as well specific configurations (which may nonetheless be dominant in particular sectors), like delivery from manufacturers or 'complex assortments' (de Koster, 2002) with bulky items and temperature sensitive goods. RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  4  we conducted a series of interviews with French and UK senior operations managers and consultants in the retail sector. This observation allowed us to identify five major multi-channel fulfillment systems. To be able to evaluate these fulfillment systems regarding the two dimensions 'economic performance' and 'customer expectations', we have to identify the relevant parameters to integrate into our proposed framework. To do so, we analyzed Marketing and Operations general literature and scholarly research. Exploration of the main strategy elements and operational challenges suggests number of parameters, indicating economic performance and customer expectations. We completed the identified parameters for evaluating customer expectations with dimensions from the ServQual and NetQual scales, measuring service quality perception from the customers. These parameters of our framework will be the dependent parameters, whereas the analyzed fulfillment systems will be the independent parameters. The exploration of the strategy factors and economic performances in the first part will allow us to apply the framework to the different fulfillment models by assessing the chosen performance parameters for each of the fulfillment systems. This shall provide a global evaluation for the each of the analyzed fulfillment systems.  STRATEGY FACTORS IN MULTI-CHANNEL RETAILING The objective of this chapter is to summarize the context of multi-channel retailing as well as the main drivers for customer expectations and economic performances, which will enable us to identify the relevant parameters to use in our proposed framework. We will first present the main characteristics of multi-channel retailing. We then will investigate how the business model of a multi-channel retailer, characterized by different elements of the retail mix, will have to be adapted to a multi-channel strategy. An exploration of the major operational challenges for a multi-channel retailer will conclude this chapter.  Multi-Channel Retailing: Characteristics & Customer Behavior Worldwide retailing is still dominated by the traditional store retailing, as 95% of food retailing and 80% of non-food retailing is realized through physical store-based retailers (Dioux & Dupuis, 2009), and online channels still represent only a small part of the total sales of the retailers. Nevertheless, the motivation to open online sales-channels is strong due to the fact that e-commerce is realizing important annual turnover growth rates of about 30% for the RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  5  last few years, whilst most other retail forms stay stable or even decline. It is therefore interesting for a store retailer to invest in the creation of an additional online sales channel.  To implement a multi-channel strategy, retailers have to decide how to adapt their business model by adjusting the elements of the retail mix. At the same time, they have to face and resolve numerous operational challenges. In multi-channel retailing, customers expect at least the same level of service, counsel, and information on every channel (cf. Heinemann, 2008). They expect to have identical customer loyalty programs across all channels, to be able to pay and pick up in the shop a product ordered on the web site, or to be able to return and exchange a product bought on the web in a store (Berman & Thelen, 2004). This channel hopping, which is a legitimate desire from a customer's point of view, may nevertheless prove to be very difficult to implement for the retailer (Vanheems, 2009). At the same time, online shoppers transfer their perception and experiences from a physical store to the website of the same brand and vice versa. Customers tend to transpose a bad experience in one channel to the other channels of the same distributor (Heinemann, 2008). As soon as their expectations are not fulfilled, they may adapt their purchasing habits, in the worst case stop buying with this retailer at all. It is therefore vital for a multi-channel retailer to make sure that every channel always meets the same level of expectations of the customers.  Multi-Channel Retail Mix  The Retail Mix consists of the mix of variables, including geographical location, merchandising, communication, price, services, product range and the personnel, which form the overall strategic marketing components of a retailing activity. It is the right mix of all these factors which determines if a retail concept is viable and successful. Compared to a store retailer, the online sales channel is not only a new channel, but rather a new business model, where experiences from the traditional (brick and mortar) store channel may not be valid any more (Heinemann, 2008). Decisive success factors in a store like store location, sales personnel and material management in the shop are not the same success factors in an online sales channel. Retailers which decide to open an e-commerce activity beside their existing store sales channel have to make sure that the co-existence of the two sales channels is working well. They have to decide how to adapt the different elements of the retail mix to each channel, RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  6  which product strategy to chose, which prices to apply, how to maintain a consistent image across the channels or what role to assign to each channel, to name a few (cf. Berman & Evans, 2009). We will briefly describe the major issues of some of the most important variables of the Retail Mix, assessing their relevance and importance in the store, the online channel and the multi-channel strategy. Product Mix The product mix is the major variable determining the activity of a retailer. It establishes if a retailer is specialized in selected product categories or a generalist. If a store based retailer opens an additional online channel, he has to decide which product mix he offers on this new channel. He can offer the identical product mix, a combination or part of his existing product mix or a completely different additional product mix on the new channel. Location of the stores A physical store's success is to a great extend influenced by its location. In order to determine if the location can attract the store's target customers, a store based retailer has to analyze socioeconomic data, transport access, mix of competitors, costs and regulation issues. These parameters, decisive for a physical store, have generally no influence on a pure online sales channel, as access to the websites is independent from a geographical location. In a multi-channel strategy, however, the store location remains important; the density of the store network can be an important factor for offering store pick-up, returns and after sales services in the stores for their online customers. Pricing The pricing policy applied in a store may take into consideration the environment of the store (socioeconomic characteristics of the geographical catchment area) and the price levels of the local competitors. Such a local pricing policy which can be applied in a store is incompatible with the global price transparency in an online channel and the exposure to price comparisons. The pricing policy of a multi-channel retailer encounters specific difficulties: the global price transparency on the internet, the specific cost structures of the store and the online channel, RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  7  the existence of specific offers and the different means of payment render it difficult to apply a consistent pricing policy across all channels. Especially the price transparency makes it difficult for a retailer to offer different prices for the same product on different sales channels. Service, store pick-up and return A multi-channel service offer can be composed of special delivery options (delivery speed, delivery timing, information on order status), the exchange policy, return policy, refunding, after sales service, payment options and consumer credits. Multi-Channel retailers can offer either to deliver the order to the customer's home or to let the customer pick-up the order in one of the stores. This service allows the customer to pick up the order whenever he likes, even sooner than with home delivery.2 Allowing customers in-store return or exchange can avoid the cost and time of returning via mail. At the same time, this offers an important possibility for the retailer to create a personal contact between the client and the sales personnel to increase customer loyalty and to generate additional sales. Personnel The sales personnel play a decisive role in stores. They welcome clients, provide counsel and advice and can influence sales. Their behavior and attitude contribute in an important way to the atmosphere and ambiance of the store and its concept.  This important parameter in a store is irrelevant in a pure online channel, except for telephone hotline contacts or the delivery service personnel. In a multi-channel strategy, however, the store personnel have to be able to orient and counsel the client using different channels. It is very important for the client not to perceive any differences or barriers between the channels.  Operational Challenges of Multi-Channel Retailing In general, the operational organization of a retailer is mainly focused on efficient store replenishment, lowering costs and shortening the product turnover time.                                                  2 In case of unavailable items, the retailer can chose to send the missing items directly to the customer and only reserve the available items in the store for pick-up. In this case, the customer experience will be negative, as the customer's decision to pick up his order in the store can't be fulfilled.   RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  8  To offer an online channel to its customers, a retailer has to be able to manage its operations in a very different way from its physical store activity. E-fulfillment may be considered as one of the most expensive and critical operations of Internet retailers (de Koster, 2002), logistics and stock management becoming core competencies (Benghozi, 2001). Keeping stock of a high number of different references, making it available, picking and packing, sending and delivering quickly at a low cost are the numerous constraints to respect. In the following, we will present and discuss the main operational issues, which are decisive for the overall performance of the multi-channel retailing. Product Availability Product availability is one of the most important parameters for customer satisfaction (Browne, 2009). A store customer usually can compare the products present in the store. Availability is indicated through the simple presence of a product in the store shelve. A customer can ask the sales personnel if there is any stock of the product or when it will be available again. An online client needs to have all this information indicated on the website together with the product information. The online channel offers the possibility to display the remaining stock of a chosen product, or even, in a multi-channel context, the remaining stock and the location of the store where the product is available for testing, purchasing or withdrawal. Displaying the availability of products or the delay of their replacement is an important marketing tool impacting the sales and influencing customer satisfaction.  Stock keeping Stores usually receive deliveries either directly from the manufacturer or from one or several logistics platforms with either warehousing or cross-docking function. As online orders may consist of different products, composing the orders from different warehouse locations may prove to be difficult and inefficient in terms of cost and delivery time. A central warehouse and fulfillment center may therefore, at a first view, be more adapted to the online channel. However, multi-channel retailers may as well pick the items for an online order directly in the stores. For an online order, the retailer has some flexibility where from he delivers the products to his customers, as he can use multiple stock locations and therefore offer a wider product range than the one contained in a single warehouse, as multiple channels may share their RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  9  inventories. In-store inventories can therefore be available for online customers' orders (Agatz et al, 2008). Centralizing stock allows easier monitoring of the stock levels for different products. If a retailer is serving its online clients (totally or partially) from stock in the stores, the overall stock level on these different locations is difficult to monitor. This is the same problem for multi-channel retailers who offer the possibility to their customers to order online and withdraw the product in a nearby store. As information on product availability is a crucial parameter for the customers buying decision, the accuracy of the stock level information is very important. Order taking and fulfillment In an online channel, the customer enters the type and number of products he wants to acquire and enters the payment information (usually done by credit cards), the online channel therefore becomes a self-service channel (Falk et al, 2007). All this information entered by the customer triggers the order preparation and fulfillment process. Retailers once delivering their stores from centralized distribution centers (often with complete boxes or pallets) have to re-think the way orders are prepared, as their organizations are not designed for small individual customers' orders. They must therefore be reorganized to treat these orders (de Koster, 2002), implementing a process of single item picking and packing. As mentioned above, another option for the retailer is to pick the items in the stores, where the products are available on the shelves, and to prepare the order in the shops. Furthermore, orders may be consolidated from multiple stock locations (for example from a warehouse and a store), which needs a specific process. The more complex the fulfilment process is organized, the more difficult it becomes to respect the quality and efficiency of this process. Delivery to the customer Besides the availability of the product, the different delivery options for a product are an important parameter for the online channel client. Different delivery service levels offered like delivery in 24 hours, delivery to a pick-up point, national post service etc. are becoming a product differentiation factor of the retailer. RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  10  Delivery to the customers' homes, which is a distinctive element of an online channel, implies to deal with cost and organizational issues. The usually small transactions have to be managed and delivered in an efficient way, while respecting the promised delivery timing. The costs of the home delivery can be totally or partially paid by the customer. This becomes an important parameter of choice for the client, as no direct delivery costs appear in the store channel. On the other hand, the costs of delivery can be used as a marketing tool for special offers (\\\"your next order free of charge\\\") or minimum order amounts (\\\"delivery free of charge for every order above 100 Euros\\\"). Delivery becomes therefore a service parameter, a price parameter and a promotional parameter. Reverse logistic Store customers can usually see, touch and try the goods before purchasing. Returns are limited and very often linked to an exchange of the product, where the returned product is put back into the shelves. Defect products are reimbursed. As online customers cannot see, touch and try the products, online retailers usually offer good conditions for the customer to return the products they don't like (due to legal and regulatory obligations, but as well as part of their customer service offer).  Return handling must be quick in the eyes of the customers, either to get a product exchange or to get reimbursed and the customer account re-credited. The process must as well be efficient as it is a very manual process and impacts the stock management of the returned products (Min et al, 2006). A physical store channel can be an easy way in the customer's eyes to return the products. MULTI-CHANNEL FULFILLMENT SYSTEMS  To operate the multi-channel strategy, retailers have to set up a fulfillment system to deliver products to the customers. This fulfillment system, organizing the process from order intake to delivery to the customer, has to match the business model and to reply to the operational challenges. Industry players are using different fulfillment systems, and several authors suggest typologies of fulfillment schemes, focusing on the locus of order preparation (de Koster, 2002; Durand, 2008). Multi-channel retailing per se intends to offer the clients the choice where and how to order and where and how to get the products delivered. RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  11  The major choice for the client is to shop in the store or shop online. If shopping online, the client can furthermore opt for delivery at home or pick up his products in one of the retailer's stores.  The retailer has to set up a fulfillment system able to respect the client's choice of the delivery mode, either by creating a new logistics infrastructure, or using the existing one, by adapting the existing processes. In order to be able to analyze the fulfillment systems from a customer expectation's perspective, we decided to distinguish the fulfillment systems by the delivery option chosen by the customer: Clients may either choose the direct home delivery for their purchases completed on the online channel or choose to pick up their purchased items in a physical store of the retailer. This in-store pick-up is a delivery option only multi-channel retailers can offer and which may be chosen to 30-40% of the customers at some multi-channel retailers (Berman & Thelen, 2004). A client going into a store in order to buy a product, searches, compares, picks the product out of the shelve and pays the product. Single-channel store shoppers may therefore not be affected by the multi-channel fulfillment organization. 1. Direct Home Delivery Direct home delivery can be completed either by the retailer's own delivery organization, a delivery logistics provider or via an external pick-up point network3. Before entering in this 'delivery pipeline', products have to be picked, prepared, packed and expedited, which can be done either in a central warehouse or distribution center, in a store, or in multiple locations (central warehouse and one or more stores).                                                   3 We consider a delivery via an external pick-up-point network (usually neighborhood shops linked to a network which offers the retreat of parcels for the clients of different retailers) like a home delivery, as the fulfillment process is quite identical, with a delivery of (sometimes pre-sorted) parcels to the pick-up point network's injection hub. Although this is influencing the ease of access, this way of delivery cannot provide a contact with the retailer as in his own store.  RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  12  1.1 Direct Delivery from central warehouse  Picking, preparation and packing of ordered items can be done from a central warehouse stocking the products (Figure 1.1). This central warehouse can either be a purpose-built entity to serve exclusively the online channel or the existing warehouse for the store operations (in which case the processes in the warehouse have to be adapted).  1.2 Direct Delivery from a store  Picking, preparation and packing of the ordered items can be done inside a physical store out of the shelves. In this case, operators pick the products into a specific order preparation cart from the shelves and then pack and send the completed order to the customer (Figure 1.2).   1.3 Direct Delivery after multi-stock consolidation  If the desired articles of an order are not available in one place, picking of the ordered items has to be done in a central warehouse as well as inside a physical store from the shelves. The picked items have then to be consolidated, prepared and packed in one site (Figure 1.3). In some cases, the multichannel  Figure 1.1: Direct delivery from central warehouse Figure 1.2: Direct delivery from a store Figure 1.3: Direct delivery after multi-stock consolidation RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  13  retailer may opt for sending the order in two different parcels, to avoid the costs and delay of the consolidation.  2 Client Pick-up in the store A customer ordering online may choose to pick up his products in one of the retailer's stores. In this case, products have to be picked, prepared, packed and kept ready for pick-up in the store. 2.1 Direct in-store order preparation  If all the products of the customer's order are available in the store chosen by the customer to pick-up, the picking, preparation and packing of the order can be done immediately in the store (Figure 2.1).     2.2 In-store order consolidation from multiple stocks  If some of the products of the customer's order are not available in the store chosen by the customer for pick-up, the unavailable items must be ordered from the central warehouse (or other stores) to complete the order. The preparation and packing of the order can be done only after consolidation of all items in the store (Figure 2.2). (A specific case of this in-store order consolidation can be a complete order  preparation in a central warehouse sent to the store only to be picked up by the customer, without further adding any product in the store).  Figure 2.1: Direct in-store order-preparation Figure 2.2: In-store order consolidation from multiple stocks RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  14  THE ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK In this part, we will first determine the parameters to integrate in our proposed framework. We then will apply this framework to the five abovementioned fulfillment systems and discuss the results. We will conclude this part discussing the limitations of the framework, suggestions for further research and managerial implications.  Customer expectations and economic performance Having analyzed the main strategy factors and operational challenges, and identified the five major fulfillment systems, we now have to determine the parameters to include into our proposed framework in order to evaluate these fulfillment systems. The different fulfillment systems lead to different levels of complexity, of costs and of product availability and therefore different levels of customer satisfaction and economic performance. To explore how a fulfillment system fits a given business model, we have to evaluate the overall performance of the different multi-channel fulfillment systems, combining the two angles of analysis:  On the one hand, we analyze to which extend a given fulfillment system is able to meet the customer expectations. On the other hand, we analyze the economic performance of each model. In our proposed framework, we will confront the different fulfillment systems to several parameters which are relevant for the customer expectations and the economic performance. The fulfillment systems may be considered as the independent variables of our analysis, whereas the different parameters of our framework represent the dependent variables. The identification of these parameters results from the exploration of the main strategy elements and operational challenges. Concerning the economic performances of fulfillment, we propose to assess different dimensions of the overall fulfillment efficiency, combining widely used indicators to describe logistics and fulfillment performances (e.g. in Agatz et al, 2008): \\u2010 Stock efficiency (indicating reliable sales forecasts and optimized product replenishment to reduce stock-risk, capability of monitoring stock levels across different stock locations and the capability of balancing stock between different locations) \\u2010 Picking efficiency (indicating efficient organization of stock and picking zones for picking and order preparation) RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  15  \\u2010 Delivery cost efficiency (indicating the total cost of delivery from the stock(s) to the customers' home or to the desired store for pick-up) \\u2010 Channel organization efficiency (indicating the information exchange between sales channels and real time availability of data) \\u2010 Fulfillment infrastructure costs (indicating the necessary investments, rents or outsourcing costs for the fulfillment infrastructure) \\u2010 Return handling efficiency (indicating the speed and quality of the return handling process, from product reception to exchange or reimbursement for the client)  Analysis in the first part of this paper suggests three parameters indicating the customer expectations: \\u2010 Product availability (indicating the availability of the desired products) \\u2010 Speed of delivery (indicating the time between the order placement and the reception of the products by the customers) \\u2010 Ease of access and return of products (indicating the ease for a client either to get the products delivered/to pick them up or to return/exchange the products received) In order to assess more precisely how a fulfillment system corresponds to the customer expectations, we completed these parameters with parameters from the ServQual framework, developed by Parasuraman et al (1988) to measure service quality. Nevertheless, this traditional service quality may not be applicable in an online environment (Parasuraman et al, 2005). Bressolles (2006) developed the NetQual framework to specifically assess electronic service quality.  As multi-channel retailing provides both 'traditional' and 'online' service experiences, we have to combine these two approaches in order to identify all the relevant dimensions to customer expectations and retain only those which may be directly impacted by the fulfilment model.  Therefore, we selected the following dimensions out of the ServQual and NetQual scales for our analysis: \\u2010 Quality and quantity of information (NetQual) (indicating the availability and correctness of the information provided in terms of product availability, stock level, delivery times etc. either on the website or in the stores)  RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  16  \\u2010 Reliability and respect of commitments (ServQual & NetQual) (indicating the ability to deliver the products in terms of quantity, price, description and timing) \\u2010 Offer (NetQual) (indicating the lengths and the width of the product range available on the different channels) \\u2010 Assurance (ServQual) (indicating the competence and friendliness of the personnel usually in the store for buying, pick-up and exchange transactions of the client).  We did not retain those dimensions having only an indirect link with the fulfillment systems. These elements constitute the analysis framework we propose to analyze the overall performance of specific fulfillment systems. Application of the Analysis Framework  We are now able to apply this proposed framework to the five identified fulfillment systems according to our objective to evaluate the fit between a multi-channel retailer's business model and a specific fulfillment system. To be able to analyze each of the abovementioned fulfillment systems, we will explore the sensitivity of each of the parameters regarding the main characteristics of the different fulfillment systems.4 We apply numerical scores to each parameter, depending if the efficiency of this parameter is high (2), medium (1) or low (0). This qualitative evaluation, based on the discussion of the different elements of the retail mix and the operational challenges, aims to compare the relative efficiency of one parameter in different fulfillment systems. We do not intend to provide an absolute performance test. Quality and Quantity of Information Customers expect correct information, especially on pricing and delivery costs of the different channels, but as well on other parameters like product availability, speed of delivery and product characteristics. The retailer's challenge is always to have the right information available on every channel.                                                  4 Each of the above identified parameters expressing customer expectations and economic performance of a specific fulfillment system has multiple implications on other parameters. It is to retain that these parameters may be interdependent (e.g. the width of the product offer impacts the product availability, the picking efficiency and the fulfillment infrastructure costs).  RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  17  Using a centralized stock provides the highest chance to have the right information available (score: 2), whereas an order preparation from stores induces the problem of obtaining the right information on the store stock level (score: 1). If the order preparation has to be completed on several stock locations (central warehouse and stores), it is very difficult to obtain correct information and the quality of information may be low (score: 0). Reliability and Respect of commitments Customers expect retailers to keep their promises, especially in terms of delivery time and delivery service. Central warehouse order preparation should facilitate this, as the quality of information is high and the fulfillment process can be optimized (score: 2). Order preparation in the stores suffers from difficulties in keeping a real-time stock level of all the products. Therefore, store preparation may guarantee only a medium level of reliability and respect of commitments (score: 1), whereas multi-stock order preparation may only provide a low level (score: 0).  Offer Customers expect to find the offer they expect on every channel, a large or narrow product range with the appropriate depth of assortment. The retailer has to make sure to be able to offer the products customers expect on every channel. Order fulfillment at a central warehouse or from multiple stocks should be capable to provide the entire range of the products (both score: 2), order preparation at the store is limited to the only product assortment in stock at the store (score: 0). Product availability The customer expects that the products he intends to buy are available in the channel he desires to use. A central warehouse order preparation may provide only a medium level of product availability (score: 1) compared to the other options, as the availability depends on the stock keeping and forecasting precision of this single warehouse. Stores can only guarantee a low level of product availability because of the small number of stock for every referenced product and the continuous buying from customers in the store (score: 0).  Multi-stock order preparation may use the stock of different entities (stores and central warehouse) and therefore guarantee a very high level of product availability (score: 2), especially in case of a high number of articles per customer order. RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  18  Speed of delivery Customers usually expect a rapid delivery of the products they bought and to be informed about the delivery timing. Retailers therefore have to implement a fast and reliable delivery process, which may imply an external delivery service provider. A central warehouse usually needs to bridge the distance to the final customer, which may be long and therefore time-consuming. A medium level of speed of delivery may therefore be guaranteed (score: 1). As stores are closer to the final customer, the speed of delivery can be high when orders are prepared in the store (score: 2). Orders prepared from multiple stock locations need a long time to be consolidated and can therefore only provide a low relative delivery speed (score: 0). Ease of access and return of products Customers expect easy access to the retailer to either pick up the products ordered or to return or exchange a product in case of dissatisfaction. Home delivery from a central warehouse may make returns and exchange difficult for customers (score: 0), who have to use a postal service for returning the products (except in the case the retailer owns a quite dense network of stores and the store channel is fully integrated to handle returns and exchange from the online channel). Order preparation in the store is usually done in the store closest to the customer. This store is therefore easy to access for the customer (score: 2). Multi-stock preparation can only provide a medium level of ease of access and return (score: 1). Although the customer can return a product to the closest store, exchange can be impossible if the products to be exchanged are only available at another stock location. Assurance The customers expect competent and friendly personnel in the store for buying, picking up their orders, return or exchange. The same expectation may apply for the personnel on telephone customer hotlines or the delivery personnel. These functions being very often outsourced (especially the latter), retailers have to focus on their own sales personnel and make sure they provide the level of assurance the customer is expecting by providing the same information to all channels. The assurance of the personnel can only be provided in the case of order pick-up of the customer in the stores (score: 2; other option scores: 0). RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  19  Stock efficiency For the retailer, the efficiency of stock management is crucial for numerous reasons. Stock keeping and monitoring of stock levels, balancing between different stock locations and the forecasting of sales and product reorders influence the availability of the products and therefore the sales. Efficient stock handling is as well an important cost element. Central stock management can provide a high level of efficiency (score: 2), whereas a store can only provide a medium efficiency (score: 1) because of the low number of products per article and the continuous stock movement due to customers purchases out of the shelves. The handling of multiple stocks in the fulfillment process is the least efficient (score: 0). Picking efficiency The picking of products out of stock to prepare the customer's order is the key process of the overall fulfillment process, representing a very important part of the warehouse operating costs. This process is nevertheless transparent to the customer. A central warehouse can be organized in a way to optimize the picking process by planning and reducing the way picking operators have to go during the process (score: 2). Depending on the volumes and the type of articles, it is possible to split the stock for whole cartons or open cartons picking or separate zones for stocking and picking. This optimization cannot be provided in a store or in multiple stock sites (scores: 0). Stores' layouts and product locations are planned to make the customer spend the maximum time in the store and not to optimize the picking (de Koster, 2002). Delivery cost efficiency Customers expect to pay the lowest extra cost possible for the delivery of their online orders and the retailer has to reduce the overall cost of the delivery. Delivery of orders prepared in a central warehouse has always to include the transport to the customer's home and therefore only achieve a medium efficiency (score: 1) compared to the delivery from a store (score: 2), where the distance to the final customer is short. Pick-up by the customer from the store where the order was prepared is the less costly way of delivery for the retailer. Any delivery from an order prepared in multiple stock locations (for home delivery or to a store for pick-up) is least efficient (score: 0), as the consolidation process of the order implies multiple costs of handling and transportation. RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  20  Channel organization efficiency As stated above, customers want to be able to use different channels simultaneously. A retailer has therefore to manage all the channels in an integrated manner.  Preparing orders for home delivery from a central warehouse is the simplest and most efficient organization (score: 2). Order preparation in the store involves the online and the store channel in the fulfillment process, therefore adding a level of complexity (score: 1). Multi-stock preparation adds further complexity, being therefore the most difficult solution to achieve an efficient channel organization (score: 0). Fulfillment infrastructure costs The fulfillment process may generate important investment costs, when a specific site is built as the stock and the distribution center, or if the design and the organization of an existing facility have to be modified. Renting or outsourcing this infrastructure generates additional costs as well. A central warehouse order preparation generates a high infrastructure cost (score: 0), whereas the store preparation generates the lowest additional infrastructure costs (score: 2). Order preparation from multiple stocks may generate medium additional infrastructure costs (score: 1) to organize the consolidation of the orders. Return handling efficiency Customers expect their returns to be processed quickly, to receive an exchange product or to get reimbursed the purchasing price. The retailer must therefore provide a quick and efficient return handling process. A central warehouse enables creation of optimized return processing (score: 2) to check the returns, repack and restock them and send the exchange items to the customers. Multi-stock fulfillment can only provide a lower rate of return efficiency (score: 1), as the returned items arrive in different locations and the exchange items may only be available on different stock locations. For a store it is very difficult to offer an optimized return process (score: 0), especially when returned products are not part of the store's product offer.  We can therefore summarize the impacts of the different fulfillment systems on the different parameters as follows (Figure 3):  RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  21  Figure 3: The Analysis Framework  Home Delivery Customer Store Pick-up Fulfillment system 1.1 1.2 1.3 2.1 2.2  Prepared in central warehouse Prepared in store Prepared in multiple stocks Prepared in store Prepared in multiple stocks Customer Expectations      Quality and quantity of information High (2) Medium (1) Low (0) Medium (1) Low (0) Reliability and respect of commitments High (2) Medium (1) Low (0) Medium (1) Low (0) Offer Medium (1) Low (0) High (2) Low (0) High (2) Product availability Medium (1) Low (0) High (2) Low (0) High (2) Speed of delivery Medium (1) High (2) Low (0) High (2) Low (0) Ease of access and return of products Low (0) High (2) Medium (1) High (2) Medium (1) Assurance Low (0) Low (0) Low (0) High (2) High (2)       Economic performance      Stock efficiency High (2) Medium (1) Low (0) Medium (1) Low (0) Picking efficiency  High (2) Low (0) Low (0) Low (0) Low (0) Delivery cost efficiency Medium (1) High (2) Low (0) High (2) Low (0) Channel organization efficiency High (2) Medium (1) Low (0) Medium (1) Low (0) Fulfillment infrastructure costs efficiency Low (0) High (2) Medium (1) High (2) Medium (1) Return handling efficiency High (2) Low (0) Medium (1) Low (0) Medium (1)       Total Score Customer expectations 7 6 5 8 7 Total Score Economic performance 9 6 2 6 2 Total 16 12 7 14 9   This indicates several results: - Home delivery from a central warehouse (System 1.1) is the fulfillment system best meeting the combination of the two dimensions customer expectations and economic performance, providing a total score of 16. This system provides the highest score in economic performance (9) and the second highest score in customer expectations (7). - Customer pick-up after preparation in the store (system 2.1) provides the highest score in customer expectation (8) and a medium score in economic performance (6). The overall performance of this system is second best (total score of 14). - Home delivery after store preparation (system 1.2) provides medium scores in customer expectations (6) and economic performance (6), ranking third best in the overall score (12).  - Any fulfillment system implying the order preparation out of multiple stocks appears to be less efficient: If the order is picked up by the customer (system 2.2), the total score is 9, if the RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  22  order is delivered at home (system 1.3), the total score is only 7. In terms of economic performance, these two systems provide the lowest score (2). - Economic performances of order preparation in the store or from multiple stocks are identical for both home delivery or in-store pick up by the customer. The difference in customer expectations (difference of 2) results from the possibility to have a personal contact with the customer, therefore responding to the customer expectation of 'Assurance', which can only be provided in a store. DISCUSSION, MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS AND RESEARCH AVENUES  The qualitative analysis of the different fulfillment systems and their impact on customer expectations and economic performance reveals that different fulfillment systems can provide high overall performance levels in terms of customer expectations and economic performance. The framework shows that orders for home delivery prepared in a central warehouse present only a slightly higher overall performance than an order prepared in a store for customer store-pick-up. A retailer has to assess the importance of each of the analyzed parameters for his specific retail mix and to optimize the trade-offs between channel fulfillment synergies and specific needs on different channels. Depending on the product mix between food and non-food products, the width of product assortment and the characteristics of the existing store network, specific solutions may be more appropriate than others to fit with a specific business model. Whereas proximity to customers is best achieved through a store network, stores add complexity on different levels in the fulfillment process which affect timing, costs and reliability. Multi-stock consolidation seems to be always by far the less efficient model, regarding the customer expectations and the economic performance. This corresponds to the three initially mentioned multi-channel retailers: Fnac abandoned the multi-stock preparation and completely integrated their fulfillment for the different channels, and neither Tesco nor Monoprix apply a multi-stock solution, whilst optimizing the in-store order preparation. RIRL 2010 - Bordeaux September 30th & October 1st, 2010  23  Our proposed framework could prove useful for multi-channel retailers in various ways: It provides a tool to evaluate the chosen fulfillment system and therefore identifying improvement potentials on specific parameters. It could also provide helpful to measure customer satisfaction. Moreover, it should clearly be useful in anticipating the needs for fulfillment systems when planning to implement a multi-channel strategy. The proposed qualitative framework should be further validated by conducting supplementary empirical analysis, although it may be difficult to compare economic performances and customer expectations of different fulfillment systems in a same company. Another difficulty may be to isolate the impacts of the supply chain from other impacts (marketing, pricing, product policy etc.). A limitation of our framework is the fact that it does not assess the interdependencies between the different dependent parameters, but only focuses on one major impact at a time. A first step to further back this framework could be to conduct a dynamic analysis through a simulation, testing values for the different parameters of the analysis framework. Research could aim to find evidence if there is an 'optimum' fulfillment system for every multi-channel retailer. Such an optimal model could be defined depending on different independent variables like product assortment, average number of items per shopping basket, value of products, product characteristics, degree of channel integration etc. This would also include an analysis of the trade-off between cost- and customer service level optimization. Such a research could as well reveal that there is no optimum model, but just a set of independent and non stabilized models evolving quickly as the retailers' strategy mix evolves.

MRP, DRP, and\\nforecasting tools support supply chain and logistics planning activities, while ERP,\\nwarehouse management, inventory track and trace systems support management of most\\nof the execution and operational activities. An entire software category, CRM, handles\\nthe relationship with the customers in many of its aspects.\\nIdeally, event management software application should be able to link the entire\\nsupply chain, monitoring the flow of goods and information, and alerting any time that a\\npotentially disruptive event or chain of events arises.\\n1.1 The evolution of supply chain event management applications\\nFirst Generation Event Management Applications\\nFirst-generation event management systems are based on inventory management and\\nshipments track and trace capabilities. These systems are able to capture single events -\\nevents are typically defined as gaps between a set and a measured level in predefined\\n6\\n7parameters, for example low safety stock, or late delivery. The criticality of the event is\\ndirectly proportional to how wide the gap is (for example how depleted is the safety\\nstock, or how many hours/days/weeks late is a shipment). Usually the number of\\nparameters that can be measured and therefore used for management by event is limited\\nto a set decided by the user and set up by the software provider or system integrator.\\nSecond Generation Event Management Applications\\nSecond-generation event management systems add to the first-generation capabilities:\\nthey not only generate alerts for events, but they also suggest a number of actions aimed\\nat addressing the problem and preventing disruptions, the most advanced are also capable\\nto prioritize this list of possible actions. For example, in the case of a late inbound\\nshipment of raw material, the system is able to offer several options of actions, such as\\nrequesting a shipment from a different supplier, or set up an expedite shipment.\\nThird Generation Event Management Applications\\nThird-generation event management software goes one step forward and offers\\nautomated functionalities as reaction to the event. For example, the system automatically\\nsends an inventory replenishment order whenever the inventory falls below a set level.\\nAdditionally, the most sophisticated software solutions are able to link together\\ndifferent software systems already in place in the supply chain, like inventory planning,\\nshipment track and trace, and customer relationship management. In this case, if an event\\nalert regarding a late shipment is generated, the system may be able to cancel the late\\norder, automatically switch to a new supplier, set up the shipment with a preferred\\ncarrier, and alert key customers.\\n1.2 Future Generations of Event Management Applications\\nEven state-of-the-art event management software, however, typically has a\\nconceptually limited and shortsighted definition of what an \\\"event\\\" is. Such systems\\n7\\n8tends to lack structure and a truly supply chain oriented framework for providing an\\nadequate definition of what an event is and a meaningful way to measure its criticality.\\nThe purpose of this thesis project is to explore the feasibility of a next generation of\\nevent management software, base on a network analysis systems for inventory/orders,\\nand encompassing the entire flow of inventory, information, and interactions betweens\\npartners and participants, throughout the entire supply chain.\\n1.3 Shortcomings of present event management applications\\nIn order for event management software to effectively support the supply chain, and\\nbe able to manage by event in a meaningful manner, there are several key factors that\\nneed to be included in the formulation of the next generation of event management\\napplications:\\n1. Simply integrating different enterprise software solutions within a single company\\nor division is often already an overwhelming task. However, building a system\\nthat can support the entire supply chain activities by event management requires\\nmuch more than that. In order to enable event management capabilities\\nthroughout the entire supply chain, integration is required not only within the wall\\nof the single corporation, but also in the \\\"gray\\\" areas between corporations, in the\\nweakest links, which often are the source of the majority of problems. Inter-\\ncompany ties require visibility to expand to and light the entire supply chain.\\nVisibility alone, however, is by no means sufficient to manage a supply chain.\\nVisibility is just the first and basic instrument for extracting information from the\\nsupply chain. The information, then, needs to be analyzed, put in perspective,\\nreferenced and compared and, finally, transformed into meaningful actions. There\\nis need for coordination and the ability to capture and eliminate repetitions,\\nduplications, and inefficiencies. Measured against a new paradigm, a \\\"disruptive\\nevent\\\" will no longer be a mere gap between set and measured levels for few\\n8\\n9discrete parameters, but rather be a disruptive trend in inventory strategies, or a\\npatterns of late deliveries with roots in the way the company negotiates\\ntransportation with its preferred carriers. Such a supply chain event management\\nsystem assumes that supply chain's participants have the capability of capturing\\nevents, and generating and transmitting data in real time, in and across the entire\\nsupply chain. This in turn assumes the adoption of communication standards\\nwithin the chain, such as XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and EDI\\n(Electronic Data Interchange) while in the reality, many participants still rely on\\ntelephone, fax, or word and excel documents exchanged by email.\\n2. Current solutions are aimed at addressing local problems, with a very low level of\\nsupply chain coordination. Presently the main purpose of the software is to detect,\\nand quickly address operational and day-to-day disruptions that may arise.\\nCurrent solutions miss a reference structure and cannot fully evaluate the impact\\nthat the problem considered may have at a higher level in the supply chain. While\\na delay in a single shipment is disruptive, a trend of repeated smaller delays may\\nbe much more harmful for the supply chain, and impossible to detect with the\\npresent event management instruments. In the currently available software, the\\ncriticality of an event occurring in specific segment of the supply chain is simply\\nmeasured as a gap against set levels. For example, if safety stock falls below a set\\nlevel, the supply chain event management system will trigger an alert, send it to\\nthe process owner at the appropriate level, or even automatically react with an\\naction (such a replenishment order) to replenish safety stock. However, the\\nsystem is not capable of measuring the event against a supply chain framework,\\nand there is no instrument to evaluate the criticality of that event over the entire\\nsupply chain flow. Without a holistic view of a supply chain, and a backbone\\nstructure that reflects this view, it becomes very difficult to meaningfully apply\\nevent management. And it becomes even more difficult to put event management\\ninto context as a tool for improving inventory management in a broad sense,\\nlinked to product lifecycle management and, at a higher level, to the long-term\\nstrategy of a company. Current solutions are not equipped to detect and evaluate\\n9\\n10\\nhow events propagate in the supply chain, and how they affect the long-term\\nbehaviors and trends in the supply chain. In the absence of a reference system to\\nput events into a wider SC perspective, a variation against a set level will\\nautomatically trigger an alert, even if the event were considered non-critical when\\nmeasured against a comprehensive supply chain model. There is not yet a network\\nto measure events against; there is no sense of path. There is no difference\\nbetween today's crisis and long-term disruptions. In the absence of a reference\\nframe or any other input, all events are equal and live just \\\"today\\\". Even in the\\nstate of the art event management solutions, there is not yet the sense of time.\\nThus, every event becomes critical and every event becomes a crisis, which needs\\nto be addressed today, and which has high probability of not leaving a trace of\\nitself.\\n3. Supply chain event management software capabilities are confined within a single\\nparameter at the time (shipment delay, safety stock level, disruption/delay in\\nproduction), while in reality, the supply chain acts as a living organism, where\\npatterns and combinations of events, through coordination, ties, and correlation,\\ncross the boundaries of different sectors and create results that may differ widely\\nfrom the sum of effects created by the single events. Currently used alert systems\\ngenerate alerts when a single exception occurs. Specifically, when a parameter\\nexits an acceptability range set in accordance with the user company's policies.\\nHowever, what often constitutes a trigger for an alert is not a single event, but\\nrather, the combination of a number of events. The presence of patterns of events\\nhappening in different segments of the supply chain, simultaneously or in\\ncascade, can lead to disruptions that cannot be prevented and avoided by\\nmonitoring single exceptions. Let's consider the following examples:\\na) A slightly late delivery event bypasses a traditional event-management system.\\nAccords are taken at the phone between the company's buyer and the supplier's\\nsale force. However, the parts to be delivered are needed for the production of\\ngoods for an important client whose demand has suddenly doubled. The result of\\n10\\n11\\nthis combination of events has a very high probability of generating a non-perfect\\norder, while none of the single events has.\\nb) A delivery of raw materials is cancelled, and this event triggers a traditional\\nexception-alert notice, or, in more advanced systems, even an automatic\\nreplenishment order. However, the materials were to be used for a client whose\\ndemand dropped significantly. Not only was the delivery cancellation not causing\\ndisruption, but it was contributing to keeping the inventory level in the correct\\nrange.\\nThese simple examples show just a few of the limitations of a traditional\\nexception-based alerting system. They are not flexible and \\\"smart\\\" enough to\\ncapture possible disruptions/improvements to supply chain processes generated by\\ncombinations of different exceptions. Additionally, human intervention - such as\\ndirect settling of a problematic event, on the phone between buyers and suppliers\\n- often cancels any trace of the event itself. In the absence of records, it is almost\\nimpossible to identify the causes of recurring problems and address them\\nappropriately.\\n11\\n12\\nChapter 2 Literature Review\\nA future generation of event management systems for inventory management across\\nthe entire supply chain, as the one suggested in chapter one, should be:\\no Built on the firm's industry-specific expertise and own practices' knowledge of\\ninventory management, and capable to monitor the key inventory metrics;\\no Based on project management principles and on a PERT-/CPM-like network for\\ninventory, used as framework for putting events into a context which is\\nmeaningful for supply chain dynamics;\\no Capable of leveraging the technology already developed for event management\\nsolutions, and available in the software currently offered,\\n2.1 Inventory parameters\\nIn order to measure and quantify the entity of the events related to inventory,\\ninventory parameters need to be set and included in the framework for an event\\nmanagement solution. Such parameters may include forecast frequency and error (to be\\nunderstood in their behavior over time), planning frequency, communication efficiency\\nbetween different levels of the supply chain, and any other relevant parameters affecting\\ninventory management. Though most parameters are common to many production\\nenvironments, there is not a set recipe, since specific industries, business practices, and\\nproduction processes may require or even dictate some of the parameters.\\nIn order to assess and correctly quantify the criticality of events, a number of factors\\nneed to be taken into consideration while setting the appropriate inventory parameters,\\nsuch factors can grouped under different families as follows:\\nProduct factors:\\nincluding details and features of products, at the product-family or SKU level, depending\\non the nature of the event management solution; product's life cycle; products' physical\\ndimensions, weight, and packaging requirements;\\n12\\n13\\nCost factors:\\nincluding factors related to products' cost, pricing, and profit margins. Factors related to\\ncost, price, cost of labor, and margin trends play an important role in monitoring a firm's\\nalignment between competitive strategy and internal practices;\\nProduction factors:\\nincluding production volume, product mix, ramp up times, production time, cost, and\\nflexibility in domains of both time and cost.\\nIt is important to notice that in the process of building a framework able to support\\ninventory management by exceptions, and when setting the inventory parameters, a firm\\nshould have a clear definition of its processes and align them with the inventory\\nmanagement strategy. Additionally, inventory parameters, and the way these parameters\\nare measured, reflect not only the nature of a firm's business, products, and processes, but\\nalso strategic choices, such as the way the firm wants to compete. Low cost, speed-to-\\nmarket, quality, and flexibility, are all different domains for competition, and each of\\nthem requires a special treatment of inventory, and a specific event management\\nframework that establish the most important metrics, and capture relevant events and\\nexceptions.\\n2.2 Project management, CPM, and PERT networks.\\nProject Management\\nProject management is defined as the coordination of groups of activities wherein the\\nmanagers plan, organize, staff, direct, and control to achieve goals and objectives with\\nconstraints on time, cost, and performance of the end product'. Project management\\ninvolves coordination, and planning, as well as sequencing and scheduling of the\\nactivities and processes that lead to the achievement of the desired goals.\\n1 Joseph J. Moder, Cecil R. Phillips, Edward W. Davis, (1983), \\\"Project Management with CPM, PERT\\nand Precedence Diagramming\\\"\\n13\\n14\\nProject management applied to the flow of inventory within the supply chain implies\\nthe capability of understanding where the inventory comes from, what relationship a firm\\nhas upstream in the supply chain with its suppliers of products, sub-assemblies, services,\\nand outsourced manufacturing. It implies also that the firm is able to correctly define the\\nsourcing, manufacturing, and inbound and outbound logistics processes as well as the\\norder fulfillment process downstream in the supply chain, by understanding customer\\nrequirements, expected service level, by being able to prioritize accounts by strategic\\nimportance and by knowing very well industry and competitive dynamics in its market.\\nNetwork Models and Critical Path\\nA network model constitutes the representation of a project as a sequence of activities\\neach requiring a set time. In a network model2 (Figure 1) all the activities preceding a\\ngiven activity must be completed before the given activity commences. Each activity\\nlinks an event to the following one, on a given path. In the sequence of activities, while\\nsome of them are exactly timed, others have a certain slack orfloat time, which means\\nthat they can be completed prior to the occurrence time of their succeeding activities.\\nIn a supply chain model, for example, it makes a significant difference if the same\\nevent occurs in a slack path (possibly no delay for the rest of the supply chain) or in a\\nnon-slack path (in which case all the activities after that will be impacted).\\nA2\\n1 2\\nA1 A3\\nB1 B2 El E2\\n0 3 4 5 8\\nC\\nD1 D3\\nD2\\n6 7\\n2 Joseph J.

Moder, Cecil R. Phillips, Edward W. Davis, (1983), \\\"Project Management with CPM, PERT\\nand Precedence Diagramming\\\"\\n4 Joseph J. Moder, Cecil R. Phillips, Edward W. Davis, (1983), \\\"Project Management with CPM, PERT\\nand Precedence Diagramming\\\"\\n15\\n16\\nIn Figure 2, the sequence B 1 -C-D3 represents the critical path for this network, in fact\\nnone of the activities on this path has float time.\\nNetwork-based Project Management\\nNetwork-based project management enable a systematic approach to project\\nmanagement and includes a clear sequences of actions aimed at creating a complete\\nproject schedule that takes into account actions, processes, resources, and boundary\\nconditions. Network-based project management methodology includes the following\\nsteps:\\n1. Project planning: defining the activities, and their technological dependence. In a\\nsupply chain event management system perspective, this translates into looking at\\nthe entire supply chain, clearly defining the processes, and deciding which\\nparameters need to be measured.\\n2. Time and resource estimation: each activity needs to be based on available\\nmanpower and equipment. In an event management system context, this implies\\nassigning time estimates to each segment of the inventory path, from suppliers or\\ntiers of suppliers, to end customer.\\n3. Basic scheduling: setting the earliest, latest allowable start and finish times for\\neach activity, and as a byproducts, they define the critical path within the network,\\nand set the slack or float time associated with non-critical paths. The critical path\\nin the supply chain is now set, and with it the slack associated to selected\\nactivities. Events are not all equally important. Their criticality now is associated\\nto the activities they affect.\\n4. Time-cost trade-offs, evaluation of the resource constraints. In a supply chain\\nenvironment, events are put into context; the choice of possible action involves\\n16\\n17\\ntrade offs that have deep roots in the strategy of the firm for inventory, pricing\\nand competition.\\n5. Resource allocation: manpower and equipment constraints\\n6. Project control (time and cost): the schedule is used to measure the actual project.\\nWhenever major changes are required in the schedule, the network is revised\\naccordingly and a new schedule is computed (see time control in chp 4, biblio 3).\\nThis will be a core part of future event management solutions.\\nPERT\\nThe Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) statistical approach to\\nnetwork modeling introduces probability theory in the management decision-making\\nprocess. PERT and Critical Path Method (CPM) are based on the same network setup, the\\nPERT system, however, uses a probabilistic approach to the time estimate for the\\nactivities.\\nGiven the mean as measure of central tendency of n measurements of the time\\nduration of an activity:\\n(2.1) - = (t + 2 +.\\nn\\nand the standard deviation as measure of variability:\\n(2.2) S = -(tF ) 2 +( 2 - F)2 +.+ (t _- )\\n2\\nn\\nt approaches te , the expected time of completion of a given activity, for a sample of\\nmeasures that approaches infinity, and similarly, st approaches the square root of the\\nvariance Vt1 12\\nThe PERT methodology then leverages the central limit theorem:\\ngiven m independent tasks to be performed in sequence; t,, the actual time required to\\ncomplete each task; Vt. the actual variance associated with each tm (Vtr and tm are\\nunknown until the ask is performed), and T defined as follows:\\n17\\n18\\n(2.3) T =t+t 2 +...+tm\\n(T is also a random variable), then for m large enough, the distribution of T is\\napproximately normal with mean E and variance VT given by:\\n(2.4) E =te +te2 +.+.tem\\n(2.5) VT =Vtl+Vt2 +.+Vtm\\nthe mean of the sums is the sum of the means, the variance of the sum is the sum of the\\nvariances, and the distribution of the sum of activity times will be normal regardless of\\nthe shape of the distribution of actual activity performance times.\\nPERT uses three time estimates for each activity, an optimistic, a likely and a\\npessimistic estimate. This range of estimates provides a measure of the uncertainty\\nassociated with the actual time required to perform the given activity. The estimated time\\nfor a given activity, in PERT is counted as a weighted average of the quantities:\\nto= the most optimistic estimate (5% percentile)\\ntm= the most likely estimate (modal estimate)\\ntp= the most pessimistic estimate (95% percentile)\\nas follows:\\nte = estimated time for the activity\\n(t0 +4tm,tp)(2.6) te 66\\n(2.7) Vt = 3 2\\nThe variance VT is computed with the following rules:\\no VT for the initial event is set to 0\\no VT for a generic, non-merge event in the network is calculated as the sum of the\\nactivity variance Vt and the precedent event variance.\\no VT for a merge event is calculated as the sum of the activity variance Vt on the\\nlongest path, in the case of ties, we use the path with the larger variance.\\n18\\n19\\nThe central limit theorem allows the assumption that the shape of the distribution of T\\nis approximately normal, therefore probabilities can attached to each possible outcomes\\nfor the project completion.\\n2.3 Existing event management software\\nSeveral firms have addressed the need for event management software. The following\\nlist includes some well-known names in the enterprise software industry:\\nCategoric Software\\nThe company's product, Xalerts, enable monitoring, notification, detection, and\\nresponse to business critical events in real time. Criticality, however, seems to be\\nmeasured again against fixed levels rather than put into a holistic supply chain context.\\nEventra\\nEventra software's event management strength lies in supply chain visibility and data\\navailability, especially related to the enterprise inbound flow.\\nJ.D. Edwards\\nAccording to Andy Carlson, J.D. Edwards' direct of supply chain product marketing\\n\\\"Inventory arrives. It's damaged in shipment. The receiving dock barcodes it and says 'not\\nacceptable.' So you move it to a hold area and [the SCEM system] triggers a\\nreplenishment order and sends a notification to the customer service person handling it.\\\" 5\\nOptum\\nOptum solution is focused on inventory visibility, with track and trace functionality,\\nand a strong operational flavor. However, there is no mention of complex event\\nmanagement and of a structure able to support more than a traditional alert system\\ntriggered by inventory levels and delays in shipment/production/order fulfillment.\\n5 http://www.line56.com/articles/default.asp?ArticlelD=4324\\n19\\n20\\nRely Software\\nRely Software's event management piece enables a traditional exception-based\\nmanagement for selective notification based on custom criteria.\\nSAP\\nEvent management enabled by track and trace functionality, that leverages single\\nevent alerts, based on a deviation from set parameters, for execution decisions.\\nSilvon Software\\nThis company focuses on business analytics, and event management is seen as an\\ninstrument for visibility. However visibility is not put into a context or framework that\\nallows determining and quantifying the criticality of the event.\\nVigilance\\nVigilance Event Management uses real-time monitoring agents to detect operational\\nissues, such as orders that are at risk of shipping late or inventory that is about to run out,\\nand to immediately alert all relevant participants in the supply chain community. Through\\nautomated escalation and web-based tracking, collaboration and closed loop control,\\nmembers of the extended supply chain are able to resolve operational issues before they\\nresult in excess cost or lost revenue.\\nViewlocity (Tilion)\\nThe company Web-enabled application focuses on visibility and supply chain\\ncollaboration, as stated in the company's Web site: \\\"... enabling users to view the most\\nup-to-date information about the state of their supply chain, to collaborate with other\\nusers about exceptions and issues, to rapidly respond to exceptions ... \\\". Still there is no\\nmention of a more complex event management structure able to self-assess event\\ncriticality as measured against a more complex supply chain model.\\n20\\n21\\nVizional (Saltare)\\nVizional's software focuses on execution, track and trace capabilities, inventory\\nvisibility, and traditional event management functionality.\\n21\\n22\\nChapter 3 Development of the Concept\\nIn order to understand how to implement project management and PERT techniques\\nin a supply chain event management context, we have approached the problem from two\\ndifferent point of view:\\no Analysis of a single order fulfillment process: the order comes into the firm and\\ntriggers a sequence of inter-related activities that ends with the customer receiving\\na shipment. This approach explores some of the supply chain dynamics through\\nthe lens of the single order, which replicates, in miniature, how the inventory\\nmoves in the out-bound chain. We have labeled it \\\"micro-dynamic\\\" approach.\\no A second approach, labeled as \\\"macro-dynamic\\\" approach, includes a PERT\\nmodel of the inventory itself, modeling the flow of goods and information in the\\nsupply chain.\\nIt's important to notice that the purpose of these two approaches is not to provide\\ndetailed PERT networks of the order fulfillment process and supply chain inventory\\nmanagement, but rather to show the potential advantages of a supply chain event\\nmanagement framework that exploits the strength of such project management tools.\\nAn additional section is dedicated to how it is possible to leverage data collected\\nthrough event management activities to support and improve the PERT network itself -\\nby gathering reliable inputs for the time estimates - and provide a solid repository for\\nbuilding a firm's in-depth knowledge of supply chain trends and dynamics, through the\\nanalysis of meaningful data.\\n3.1 Micro-dynamics approach: a network path for the order fulfillment process\\nThe order fulfillment process has been selected for a first approach to the use of a\\nPERT methodology in an event management context. The idea is to build a network that\\nidentifies a critical path and see how to measure events against the network scheme.\\n22\\n23\\nFigure 3 shows a simplified project network model of a single order fulfillment.

A problem is critical if it\\nimplies a delay for the customer.

An event is not critical if there is slack that allows for delays in the process\\nwith no delay for the final customer. Events can be then sorted based on the path were\\nthey occur, that path's criticality, and the consequences that events bring to the overall\\nsystem critical path.\\nGiven the normal distribution of the project completion time, under the PERT\\nassumptions, it is also possible to calculate the probability to complete the project -\\nfulfillment process in the case of the example - on time, or on a given day before or\\nafter the expected completion time, assuming that there are no changes in the critical\\npath. For the fulfillment process example, the expected completion time is 19 days, and\\nfigure 6 shows the probability of completing the process in different completion times,\\nfrom 15 to 25 days.\\nFigure 7.

Events that do not introduce delays in the overall project.

Events that fall on the critical paths, and therefore introduce delays in the overall\\nproject, but without changing the critical path. The delays introduced from such\\nevents will always propagate in the supply chain and lead to an overall process\\n28\\nCumulative Probability of Completion\\nof the Project\\n1.0-\\n0..8\\n0.0.\\n17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33\\n29\\ndelay, but the sequence of activities that determines the critical path does not\\nchange; and\\n3. events that fall into slack paths and introduce delays larger than the allowed slack,\\ntherefore generating new critical paths. Such events change the sequence of\\nactivities that lie on the critical path and design a new critical path.\\n3.3 Memory of past events: turning event management into a tool for monitoring\\nmid-and long-time strategic goals.\\nA very important part of a PERT framework in a supply chain event management\\ncontext is a repository storing information about past events. Such a resource, which has\\nthe function of \\\"memory\\\" for the event management system, will be used for assessing\\nthe probability of delays based on past events. The information about past events,\\ngenerated by the system, and stored in the repository, can provide data for setting the\\nparameters to, tm, and tp for each path in the network.\\nAdditionally, the information, and the behavior of the changes of critical paths can be\\nused to categorize and understand mid- and long-term patterns and trends, versus short-\\nterm fixes, and understand the roots of the problems.\\nFor example, from a high frequency of events in an inbound transportation path,\\nrather than simply extracting the frequency of late shipments, which does not necessarily\\nhave an operational relevance, we can extract the following information:\\no What percentage of late shipments is disruptive, and generates an overall delay to\\nthe supply chain (because they either fall on a critical path, or on a path with slack\\nand the delay exceeds the slack);\\no What percentage of these disruptive delays can be associated with specific causes,\\nsuch as the choice of carrier, or supplier;\\n29\\n30\\no How the expected time of completion in a path evolves in time, and how\\nperformance of suppliers of parts and services can affect the probability of\\nperformance in specific paths, especially in critical ones.\\n30\\n31\\nChapter 4 Conclusions and Findings\\n4.1 Key Findings\\nThese are some of the key findings that emerge from the analysis of the adoption of a\\nPERT-based network for inventory to be used in supply chain event management:\\n1. A definition of \\\"criticality\\\" is key to have effective supply chain management by\\nevents. Project-management based frameworks, like the one developed in this\\nproject thesis, should be used as a base for building an event management system\\nwith a clear and well-defined concept of criticality embedded in it;\\n2. Not all events are equal. There are multiple dimensions to define the relevance\\nand criticality of an event. Presently available solutions are able to exploit one\\nsingle dimension: the gap between a planned level and an actual one. However, a\\nuseful and operationally sound definition of criticality should also include the\\neffects and repercussions of that delay into the supply chain, and link the event to\\nthe changes that may be created in the critical path;\\n3. Such networks do not simply compare set levels of certain parameters, but rather\\n\\\"learn\\\" from the past. Past events contribute to the computation of path\\ncompletion estimates and associated probability, thus they are instrumental in\\ndefining the probability of future events and determining the critical path (which\\ndepends on longest paths in first place and on largest variances as second element\\nfor choices);\\n4. When an event changes the critical path, by affecting an activity with slack time\\nand exceeding the available slack, then a new critical path will be determined in\\nthe network. In this case, \\\"criticality\\\" can shift to new areas of the supply chain,\\nwith consequences that can be located very far from the path where the event\\n31\\n32\\nhappens. A project management definition of criticality and a holistic view of the\\nsupply chain can help put events into a context and monitor the \\\"critical\\\" part and\\npaths in the supply chain.\\n5. When the attention shifts from looking at gaps between expected and measured\\nparameters, to considering the consequences of an event throughout the entire\\nsupply chain network, then event management becomes a way to gain insight into\\nsupply chain dynamics and a tool to understand and strategically manage the\\nsupply chain, rather than \\\"fix\\\" problems locally;\\nAll these elements lead to a division of events in four major families:\\no Events that do not bear supply chain-wide consequences: these are events\\nthat happen in activities with slack times, and introduce perturbation with\\na duration shorter than the available slack.\\no Events that introduce time delays in the supply chain: these are events that\\nfalls on the critical path (which is the longest path in the network),\\ntherefore, whatever delay they introduce, will propagate throughout the\\nentire network;\\no Events that define new critical paths: these events not only introduce delay\\nin the network, but also re-define the concatenation of paths that form the\\ncritical one. Such events introduce substantial changes in the network ad\\nshift criticality to new activities that can suddenly assume a different\\nmeaning for the overall supply-chain.\\no \\\"New\\\" events: the definition of what a \\\"critical event\\\" is can be expanded\\nbeyond a single occurrence of a gap between a set and a measured level\\n(in inventory, safety stock, transit time). The new definition includes\\npatterns in demand and supply, changes in probabilities, opportunities of\\nbundling, and a number of other elements that can influence a path\\ncriticality\\n32\\n33\\n4.2 What is needed to get there\\nIs it possible to implement such a system? In most cases the answer is: not yet. Or at\\nleast, not at a supply-chain wide level. Yet, even partial implementations of systems\\ndriven by such project-management network models represent a significant improvement\\nover presently available supply chain management systems. What then is needed and may\\nnot yet be there?\\n1. A central repository for supply chain information. As said, not all events are equal\\nand they can impact the supply chain in very different way, especially patterned\\nand repeated events. Dramatic changes in critical path can suggest the need for\\nchanges in a firm's strategic approach to certain areas of the supply chain.\\nAnalysis and understanding of such changes can guide high-level decisions, such\\nas outsource vs. manufacture, internal fleet vs. external carrier among others. The\\nfirst step, however, is to be able to capture such event-related information and\\ntrends, in a central repository that can function as a \\\"memory\\\" for the entire\\nsystem.\\n2. More informatization in the supply chain. If activities included in the critical path\\ninvolve parties (such as suppliers, transportation provider, contract manufacturers,\\ncustomers, among others) that are not able to link their IT system to the event\\nmanagement system, there may be severe limitation to the purpose and scope of\\nan event management system.\\n3. Access to past event-related information. The central repository has the multiple\\nfunctions of central unit for the coordination of supply chain event management\\ntrigger system, of source for the PERT network path completion time estimates,\\nand of storage point for event logs, which can then be retrieved and used for\\nanalytics and data mining activity.\\n33\\n34\\n4. Internal company barriers can put limitations to what can be done with an event\\nmanagement system. The layout of a frame system for supply chain event\\nmanagement requires coordination and inclusion of strategic, tactical, and day-to-\\nday activities, keeping into account the entire supply chain and the firm's overall\\nstrategy. It is important that all the parties involved make their contribution,\\nbecause that will determine the definition of critical paths.\\n34\\n35\\nBibliography\\n1) David I. Cleland, William R.

      "        \"abstract\": \"Inventory management is important in meeting customers\\u2019 requirements. Similarly, the effectiveness of supply chain management in the order fulfillment process is critical for the organization to stay in business. Inventory determines the service level of any organization as the adequate and timely flow of inventory across the supply chain and manufacturing processes is imperative for the success of the organization. This ensures high rating on order fulfillment and ensures profitability. In the supply chain, inventory management is a critical part of the process as inventory is an asset and any shortage of inventory impact performance negatively. To keep the right level of inventory is a challenge for all companies and the challenge is becoming more complex with the drastic and frequent changes in demand. This also makes the forecasting process more tedious and difficult. The constant changes in customer preferences with the increases in demand have affected order fulfillment as most manufacturing facilities do not have the additional capacity to cope with sudden increase in orders. They require huge investment and with the shortening of product life cycle, the period to apportion return on investment has to be relatively short compared to the past experience. This affects working capital and increasing working capital is not an easy task unless the organization is wealthy. As Malaysia embarks on the aerospace industry, the dilemma for the manufacturers are similar. The high cost of raw materials in inventory and inventory holding significantly affects order fulfillment. The findings of this study differs from the normal business inventory management practices, thus offering new knowledge and learning curve in the inventory management context of the high technology industry, in particular, the aerospace.

Similarly, the effectiveness of supply chain management in the order fulfillment process is critical for the organization to stay in business. Inventory determines the service level of any organization as the adequate and timely flow of inventory across the supply chain and manufacturing processes is imperative for the success of the organization. This ensures high rating on order fulfillment and ensures profitability. In the supply chain, inventory management is a critical part of the process as inventory is an asset and any shortage of inventory impact performance negatively. To keep the right level of inventory is a challenge for all companies and the challenge is becoming more complex with the drastic and frequent changes in demand. This also makes the forecasting process more tedious and difficult. The constant changes in customer preferences with the increases in demand have affected order fulfillment as most manufacturing facilities do not have the additional capacity to cope with sudden increase in orders. They require huge investment and with the shortening of product life cycle, the period to apportion return on investment has to be relatively short compared to the past experience. This affects working capital and increasing working capital is not an easy task unless the organization is wealthy. As Malaysia embarks on the aerospace industry, the dilemma for the manufacturers are similar. The high cost of raw materials in inventory and inventory holding significantly affects order fulfillment. The findings of this study differs from the normal business inventory management practices, thus offering new knowledge and learning curve in the inventory management context of the high technology industry, in particular, the aerospace. The findings indicate that inventory management or the inventory conversion period has an inverse relationship with organization\\u2019s profitability.

The complexity of consumer choices has made the inventory management system a bigger challenge.  According to Slack et al. (1995), inventory is maintained to cater for customers\\u2019 orders and competition and also to mitigate the effect of production and delivery lead-time. This leads to the concept of \\u2018make to stock\\u2019 instead of \\u2018make to order\\u2019 in anticipation of orders. The concept \\u2018make to stock\\u2019 requires an effective forecasting process, particularly the accuracy between the forecast and actual orders. Moreover, the consumers\\u2019 knowledge and choices have changed over the years and the current emphasis is more than \\u2018fulfilling the needs\\u2019 but rather \\u2018satisfying their needs\\u2019. Thus, for many manufacturers, having the product range with high consumer demand are preferable with a wider range of options. They become more competitive, particularly for technology related products.     Inventory is part of the assets of an organization and therefore, it is part of working capital. For some industries, for example, the high technology industry, the working capital required to finance operations is high. Mistakes have serious consequences. Many have difficulties coping with the continuous investment required to stay in business. In the aerospace industry, delays from the suppliers can result in the companies compensating customers for late delivery of the airplane. The amount involved in paying the penalty due to late delivery can easily wipe out profit for the year and will definitely affect the company working capital in the near future. Thus, it is not surprising that most large organizations recognize the importance of supply chain management and include it as a key activity to improve the organization performance. Traditionally, organizational performance is linked to profitability. This can be achieved through order fulfillment. Such measurement is still very much valid, for instance, the return to shareholder fund is an important measurement to convince the shareholder for future re-investment, for additional capacity or new equipment or technologies as the industry dictate from time to time. Apart from profitability, another important measurement is the volume of sales either by pieces sold or the amount invoiced. Purchases in bulk or higher quantity reduces the fixed cost and to some degree, it is able to share out the variable cost. The greater the volume of purchases, the more likelihood that per item price will be reduced, either through effective negotiation or bulk purchase discount offered by the suppliers. Moreover, with the intense global competition, many companies have started working closely with their suppliers to improve their product quality, and at the same time, reduce the cost of the products. This can be observed in the electronics sector where the big players are pushing the inventory management responsibility to their suppliers via a program known as vendor managed inventory. In such initiative, the suppliers manage the total inventory requirements and they are taking risks in the process of managing Order Fulfillment in Supply Chain Management: Does the Dimension of Inventory Management Matter in the Aerospace                  45Industry in Malaysia: 43-52                                                                                                                                                      the inventory level and replenish when necessary. Within the context of information technology, this is where information sharing is viewed as very important and crucial. The suppliers are made aware of any stock movements. The information is in real time thus ensuring accuracy in decision making.  It is often argued that organizations with weak inventory management are not competitive and may fail to survive. According to Lewis (2003), continuous down time in the manufacturing can lead to higher cost of operation. In the absence of inventory management, order fulfillment is affected. Thus, the success or failure of the business totally depends on the inventory management as high order fulfillment generates better customer service level and higher profitability. Moreover, many items today have a shelf life and strict requirements to ensure the product functions optimally during usage and throughout the total product life cycle. In the aerospace industry, the firms impose shelf life for most of the items used, especially for items termed \\u2018flyaway\\u2019 products, where records must show that these items are still valid and as described in the requirements. Apart from the shelf life, keeping the items in the recommended storage condition is equally important where the composite materials are required to be stored for instance,in an environment below 20oC. Otherwise their properties need to be retested before further product applications. This reveals the importance of inventory management in the airline industry.Inventory and Supply Chain Management in the Aerospace Industry 2.0 This paper examines the relationship between inventory management and order fulfillment performance. It reviews the literature examining the supply chain management and its effect on company profitability in the aerospace (high technology) industry. With the rapid rate of globalization and intense competition in the business arena, major changes are expected in inventory management and the entire supply chain management dealing with the planning and control of total material flow from end to end, that is from suppliers to end users. One of the very important parts of the supply chain is to determine the location of inventory and at what level to efficiently provide efficient service to customers at the most competitive cost. Effective inventory management will result in the right level of customer service. The right service level ensures that customers are satisfied and having the right policies in the inventory management is part of the total supply chain management concept. Inventory optimization can reduce the working capital or capital outlay, but the level required to balance with the level of customer service required is of utmost concern as many suggest that this could be different between firms in different industries The necessary inventory level to be maintained to ensure that manufacturing processes are not affected is the primary goal for most manufacturers and the losses incurred for down time are always too expensive. Moreover, there is possibility that the manufacturer\\u2019s capacity loss due to delays cannot be recovered. This damages the  firm\\u2019s reputation and 46                                                                                               Journal of Business Management and Accounting, Vol. 6(2) 2016: 43-52customer\\u2019s expectation. In such occurrences, there is a likelihood of losing customers. For the aerospace industry, any delays including non-performance in delivery result in heavy penalty imposed by the industry players.  Therefore the relationship between inventory and order fulfillment in the context of supply chain management is important and expected to apply more stringently in the aerospace industry. Inventory management does not receive much attention from the top and senior management unless there are issues of production stoppage or customer\\u2019s claim due to delivery delays. In most cases, top management only gets involved when the situation is really bad and some use the fire-fighting strategy to combat the problems. During such correction time, apportioning blame and finger pointing is usual in organizations. However, the root cause of the problem is never resolved, neither are plans made for improvements nor corrections carried out. Based on findings from previous studies, the inventory management issue must be given serious attention by all, industry pratictioner and the academics. Inventory management must be included in the core subject due to its importance in meeting the customer\\u2019s requirements and a primary factor in determining service level. The industry must have individuals who are well versed in inventory management in order to minimize the problems arising from the supply chain process and activities. Figure 1 indicates the supply chain process in the aerospace industry and it can be observed that it is not much different from the supply chain process for most manufacturers as given by most textbooks. Figure 1. The Supply Chain ProcessIn supply chain management, information sharing is an important element (Paulraj, 2004; Devaraj, Krajewski & Wei 2007). Information on lead-time and quantity are important for the success of the supply chain management. According to Zhang et al. (2002) and Chopra (2001), it also ensures improvement in the supply chain cycle. Lee !\\\"!!  Order Fulfillment in Supply Chain Management: Does the Dimension of Inventory Management Matter in the Aerospace                  47Industry in Malaysia: 43-52                                                                                                                                                      et al. (1997) suggests that the supplier\\u2019s demand difference is drastically reduced due to the sharing of information among them. The fact that supplier management has become an important part of supply chain management is evident in our study. However, there are studies that stated otherwise. For example, the study by Cachon and Fisher (2000) found the insignificant benefits of information sharing. Their finding is not unexpected, as the possible reasons could be the limited data size.    With regard to the number of sources in supplying products and materials to the manufacturers, the source of inventory from one source and two sources makes a substantial difference when there is an imbalance in demand and supply (Tang, 2006). When there is an alternative, it means there is no restriction (Gavirneni et al. 1999) and the information becomes valuable when it is flexible in responding to the system. In our study, the leading edge organizations are moving their quality focus from inspection to designing quality into products coupled with process control and process improvement efforts. They have appointed suppliers and the number is very small, only one or two suppliers for most materials. Thus, the service level is expected to be efficient as it affects the success in managing the supply chain and the organization performance.Due to the high carrying cost in the aerospace industry, the amount of inventory is kept at a minimum level most of the time. To minimize the inventory, the aerospace organizations work with the suppliers and the small number of suppliers allows for better relationship with them. In theory, assuming the volume remains constant, a decrease in supplier base means an increase in volume to the strategic suppliers and possible reduction in price due to increase in quantity. This is something that is disputable in our study. The research framework for our study is provided as in depicted in figure 2.Figure 2. Research FrameworkResearch Methodology3.0 The methodology adopted in our research is the quantitative approach. The data collection was done using questionnaires distributed to identified suppliers to the IV DVStock holdingInventory riskSafety stockStorage practiceOn-time-deliveryInventory turnsInventory management Order Fulfillment 48                                                                                               Journal of Business Management and Accounting, Vol. 6(2) 2016: 43-52aerospace manufacturers in Malaysia. As the quantitative cum deductive approach requires a clear understanding of the type, collection and analysis of evidence within a well-defined theoretical framework, the research methodology section here covers the mentioned aspects.  The target population is the companies that have business deals with the two main aerospace companies in Malaysia. A total of 20 companies were identified from the list provided by both Boeing and Airbus companies. For each company, 5 sets of questionnaires were distributed to the managers. In total, 85 sets of questionnaires were returned. The main reason the total population is low is that the aerospace industry is relatively new in Malaysia. With the required technology and considerable huge investment, not many are able to become suppliers. The study thus becomes like a census. However, they were not compelled to respond to the questionnaire and only those who were willing to participate were counted as the sample. The data collection process was difficult as most of the respondents practice very strict rules on matters pertaining to sharing information with outsiders.  The dependent variables are on-time-delivery and inventory turns, which represent order fulfillment. The independent variables as provided in figure 2 are the (i) safety stock, (ii) storage practice, (iii) inventory risk and (iv) stock holding. Each is examined separately, thus, eight hypotheses were tested. Validity and reliability tests were performed prior to the regression analysis.  4.0 FindingsThe data collected for this study was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Missing data and outliers were removed during the analysis. Reliability tests, using Cronbach\\u2019s alpha, were performed on the measures of \\u201cinventory management\\u201d and \\u201corder fulfillment\\u201d. For the measure of \\u201cinventory management\\u201d which has four dimensions: stock holding, inventory risk, safety stock, and storage practice, the reliability scores range from 0.610 (safety stock) to 0.859 (stock holding). The scores indicate that the measure of \\u201cinventory management\\u201d has acceptable reliability levels for its dimensions. Reliability scores for the \\u201corder fulfillment\\u201d, which has two dimensions: on-time delivery and inventory turns, are 0.763 and 0.765 respectively. The scores indicate that both dimensions of \\u201corder fulfillment\\u201d possess acceptable levels of reliability. The results of the reliability tests are shown in the following table, Table 1.Regression analyses were conducted to examine the effects of the inventory management dimensions on order fulfillment. The first analysis was to examine the effects of those dimensions on the first dimension of order fulfillment, i.e. on-time delivery. The second analysis was to examine the effects of the inventory management dimensions on the second dimension of order fulfillment, i.e. inventory turns.

Only one out of four dimensions is significantly related with on-time delivery: safety stock (\\u03b2 = 0.276, p \\u2264 0.05). For inventory turns, two of the inventory management dimensions are significantly related to it: safety stock (\\u03b2 = 0.209, p \\u2264 0.10) and storage practices (\\u03b2 = 0.296, p \\u2264 0.01). These two dimensions of inventory management account for about 29.6% of variance in inventory turns (R2 = 0.296, F= 5.176, p < 0.000).Table 2 Results of the Regression AnalysisIndependent variables DV \\u03b2    Sig.

This opposite finding could be explained by the fact that this study was conducted in a high technology industry where the cost of stock holding is very expensive. Moreover, the items are specialized and relatively in fewer in number. Its supply is regulated by the manufacturers of the raw material and it is more toward a \\u2018just-in-time\\u2019 practices. Similarly, the results for inventory risk also show different findings from the previous literature, for example by Harland et al. (2003) and Kleindorfer and Saad (2005). Similar arguments can be used to justify the insignificant effect of inventory risk on order fulfillment, further justification could be that the high technology players are cash rich which represents a relatively low percentage of the total working capital.Results for the test on safety stock indicate a significant effect on both dimensions of order fulfillment. This is in line with many findings of previous studies such as (Hult et al., 2004), Wanke (2011) and Sheffi and Rice (2005). In the aerospace industry, the importance of safety stock can not be denied. If the components are not available just-in-time, ultimately the cost of processing will increase drastically due to the expensive nature of operations. The results of the tests on storage practices show a significant relationship only with inventory turn. This is explained by the fact that inventory turns influences the storage practices and policy (Levy, 1997), thus having the right storage practices affects the inventory turns, as proven in the finding. Moreover, the storage practices appear to be cost significant to both of the dimensions of order fulfillment. Thus, it is suggested here that in the aerospace industry, due to the high value of components, more inventory turns are required. This requires better and appropriate storage practices and policies.The findings of this study are actually similar to various research findings such as Levy (1997) and Pujawan N (2008). This proves the importance of inventory management in order fulfillment for all industries inclusive of the high technology aerospace industry. Although only two dimensions of inventory management: safety stock and storage practices, were found to be significant, it is justified by the nature and the environment of the industry. This paper provides a fresh perspective on inventory management affecting the order fulfillment. It shows that it is important to take the necessary steps to support the order fulfillment in a supply chain environment. Within the context of high technology firms, particularly the aerospace industry, safety stock and storage practices are the two important factors in inventory management to improve order fulfillment. Many organizations have been paying the penalty for non-conforming to delivery without realizing the importance of managing their supply chain management. It is suggested that future studies should look into different contexts such as in the solar industry, which also has a high carrying cost and high value of raw materials.

The\\ncompany markets its products under the Chiquita @ and Fresh Express @ brands and other\\nrelated trademarks. The perishable nature of Chiquita's products presents a challenge in\\nmanaging the inventory as keeping track of the age of inventory is challenging. The multiple\\nlayers of inventory locations throughout the supply chain further complicate the issue of\\ninventory management. Additionally, the volatile demand of the Fresh Express line and the\\ninexperienced produce buyers at the retail level make the issue even more challenging.\\nDeveloping better order and inventory policies requires an understanding of the impacts of the\\nproduct's limited lifetime, the interactions of multiple inventory locations, and the trade-off\\nbetween the relevant costs and the customer service levels.\\nThe objective of our research is to quantify these impacts and trade-offs to help\\nChiquita's management to develop a better inventory policy that minimizes the costs and at the\\nsame time achieves the desired customer service levels. The management at Chiquita is\\nconsidering changing the existing inventory and order policies in order to minimize out-of-stock\\nand spoilage for its Fresh Express line of packaged green salads. Due to confidentiality\\nconcerns, all the numbers used throughout the thesis are for illustrative purposes only and are not\\nnecessarily indicative of actual performance at Chiquita.\\n1.1 Problem Description\\nWhile most inventory models assume that items can be stored indefinitely to meet future\\ndemand, in reality not all items have an infinite lifetime. Perishable inventory is defined as items\\nthat decay in storage; as time elapses, the items gradually become partially or entirely unsuitable\\n10\\nfor consumption. Typical examples of perishable inventories include fresh produce,\\nphotographic films, drugs, and blood. Perishability is typically classified into two categories:\\nfixed lifetime and random lifetime. A product with a fixed lifetime has a pre-determined\\nlifetime, meaning after a specific number of periods, the product becomes unusable and must be\\ndiscarded. In reality, many products have random lifetimes because the exact lifetime cannot be\\npre-determined. For example, a product with a random lifetime could decay exponentially,\\nimplying that a fraction of the inventory is lost each period. Products could also have a random\\nlifetime, a variable with a specific probability distribution (Nahmias, 82).\\nPerishability presents a challenging problem for inventory management. Perishability\\ncan lead to increases in four costs:\\n\\\" Inventory shrinkage costs: costs due to inventory that must be discarded because of\\nspoilage\\ne Shortage costs: lost sales costs due to inventory stock out caused by perishability\\n\\\" Ordering costs: higher ordering costs due to more frequent purchases to counter the\\nperishable nature of the products\\n\\\" Inventory carrying costs: higher inventory holding costs due to the lack of understanding\\nfor the proper inventory level\\nIn order to effectively manage inventory costs, supply chain managers must keep track of each\\nage level of the inventories. However, keeping track of the age of each unit at each period may\\nbe difficult and impractical for most companies due to extensive computations that are involved.\\nGiven this complexity, optimizing the system is incredibly difficult.\\nMost supply chain networks have a series of inventory locations; rarely is there only one\\ninventory location that ships to the final destination. Supply chain networks with multiple layers\\nof inventory locations are referred to as multi-echelon supply chains. Having inventory in\\nmultiple layers may have benefits, such as shorter lead time for the final destinations, better\\nservice for the final destinations, and lower transportation cost through shipment consolidation.\\nHowever, since available inventory is divided and stored at more than one location, a multi-\\nechelon system may have a higher risk of not having the right amount of product at the right\\nlocation at the right time (Taylor, 2004). In order to have an effective inventory policy, one must\\ndetermine the dependencies between echelons and the proper inventory level required at each\\nechelon.\\n1.2 The Case of Chiquita's Fresh Express\\nChiquita's Fresh Express network represents a complex multi-echelon perishable supply chain.\\nThe raw materials of Fresh Express products are harvested from either California or Arizona,\\ndepending on the season, and then shipped across the United States to Chiquita's plants to be\\nprocessed and packaged. The cycle time for raw materials to be turned into packaged salads is\\ntypically two or three days. Once the salads are packaged, they are usually shipped to Chiquita's\\ncustomers' distribution centers (DC) within two days. Typically, the products stay in customers'\\nDCs no longer than two days before they are shipped again to the retail locations. The total lead\\ntime is merely four to six days for Chiquita to harvest the vegetables from the field, ship the\\nvegetables across the nation to be processed into packaged salads, ship the packaged salads to\\ncustomers' distribution, and deliver them to the retail locations.\\nAdditionally, the high demand volatility of packaged salads further complicates the issue\\nof managing Fresh Express inventories. The sales volume of packaged salads is heavily\\ninfluenced by retail promotions; a high percentage of Fresh Express' volume is sold under\\npromotions. The retailers frequently lower the prices for two purposes: to increase sales volume\\nand store traffic as a part of the marketing efforts, and to clear out aging inventory to minimize\\nthe risk of potential loss of unusable inventories.\\nThese three issues (perishability, the multi-echelon system, and the high demand\\nvolatility) combine together make inventory management for Fresh Express extremely difficult.\\nInventory is often managed based on buyers' experience and intuition, which is by nature subject\\nto human error. As a result, Chiquita and the retailers often carry excessive inventories to try to\\nachieve a high service level. A large percentage of the inventory at the retailers' warehouses and\\nthe retail stores is considered no longer fresh for consumers to purchase and needs to be\\ndiscarded. Hence, Chiquita would like to know whether or not a better multi-echelon inventory\\nmanagement system can be developed for its Fresh Express products. Specifically, Chiquita is\\ninterested in answering the following questions:\\n1) What are the parameters for optimal inventory management depending upon forecast\\naccuracy, inventory carrying cost, product perishability, lost sales and inventory shrinkage\\ncosts?\\n2) What is the trade-off between service level and inventory costs?\\n3) What is the impact of increased forecast accuracy on inventory-related costs?\\n1.3 Research Motivation\\nThe analysis of multi-echelon perishable systems is not as well developed as that of single-\\nechelon perishable systems. Most research for multi-echelon perishable systems has assumed\\nthat the product has a fixed lifetime at each echelon, the system uses a continuous review\\ninventory policy (inventory is reviewed continuously, and an order is placed whenever the\\ninventory reaches below a particular level), and the system allows backorders (unfilled orders\\ncan be fulfilled in the future). However, Chiquita's Fresh Express supply chain is a multi-\\nechelon system with products that have random lifetimes. Also, the system uses a periodic\\nreview inventory policy (inventory is reviewed periodically, and an order may be placed based\\non the inventory level after each review) and unfilled orders are considered lost sales. Therefore,\\nthe assumptions used in most research are not applicable to Chiquita's Fresh Express supply\\nchain.\\nIn this thesis we develop an inventory management system that simulates Chiquita's Fresh\\nExpress supply chain. Our research focuses on identifying ways to minimize out-of-stock and\\ninventory shrinkage while maintaining high service levels, which are common goals that most\\ncompanies share. The objective of this research is to address the three key questions posed in the\\nprevious section by Chiquita and provide recommendation on multi-echelon inventory systems\\nfor fresh produce supply chains.\\n1.4 Research Scope\\nThis research uses Chiquita's Fresh Express supply chain as a case to develop a better\\nunderstanding of the challenges that fresh produce companies may face in managing their\\ninventories. In order to simulate Chiquita's supply chain, the research assumes that all products\\nhave random lifetimes that decay according to a shrinkage probability and have maximum\\nlifetimes of 14 periods (days). The system uses a periodic review and all backorders in the\\nsystem are considered lost sales. These assumptions are based on system descriptions provided\\nby Chiquita personnel.\\nOur analysis focuses on one supply chain of Chiquita's Fresh Express line, which starts at\\nChiquita's plant in Georgia. This plant is located across the nation from the sources of raw\\nmaterials. We chose this location because it serves one of Chiquita's biggest customers, which\\nwe refer to as ABC, Inc. (ABC). For the next echelon, we chose ABC's DC located in Florida,\\n.~ .' . ... . .......\\nbecause this DC is served by Chiquita's Georgia plant and has one of the highest sales volumes.\\nFigure 1.1 illustrates the physical locations of the sources of raw materials, Chiquita's plant in\\nGeorgia, and the customer's DC in Florida.\\nLegendPlant, \\nGA\\nLeizend\\nRaw product transport during Summer Customer DC, FL\\n- Raw product transport during Spring and Fall\\n- Raw product transport during Winter Retail Stores, FL\\n-- lb Finished product transport\\nFigure 1.1: Chiquita's Fresh Express Supply Chain\\nAdditionally, we chose two retail stores that have typical characteristics shared by most\\nretail locations served by the customer's DC. We chose this supply chain because it represents a\\nlarge portion of Fresh Express' volume and possesses common characteristics shared by Fresh\\nExpress' other supply chains with other customers. The physical structure of this supply chain\\n(one plant, followed by one DC, followed by multiple retailers) is common for Chiquita.\\nTherefore we expect the results of our research to be applicable to Fresh Express' other supply\\nchains and to provide insights to other companies that have similar supply chain structures.\\n1.5 Thesis Structure\\nThe thesis continues as follows. In Chapter 2, we provide a review of the relevant\\nliterature and methodology used in other research. In Chapter 3, we provide the methodology,\\nvarious assumptions and the conceptual flow of our research and model. In Chapter 4, we\\ndocument the model, the results of each simulation run, and a detailed analysis for each scenario\\nin the testing plan. Finally in Chapter 5, we conclude by providing overall observations and\\nimplications of our research, key insights, and recommendations for future research.\\n2 Literature Review\\nIn order to determine the best approach for modeling Chiquita's supply chain, we surveyed the\\nacademic literature to understand analytical approaches on how to develop an inventory policy\\nfor perishable products in multi-echelon systems. The literature available on inventory systems\\nfor perishable items varies by a combination of four assumptions or considerations: deterministic\\nor stochastic demand, fixed or random lifetime, single period or multiple period of product\\nlifetime, and single or multiple echelons. In Section 2.1, we review the analytical approaches for\\nsingle echelon inventory management, and in Section 2.2, we review the analytical approaches\\nfor multi-echelon inventory management systems. Although the amount of literature on\\nperishable inventory available is abundant, none of the models have assumptions that match well\\nwith the reality in Chiquita's business model.\\nDue to the complexity and limitations involved in implementing an analytical model for\\nChiquita's Fresh Express supply chain, we also surveyed literature on simulation methodologies\\nto better understand whether a simulation model would be suitable for the scope of our research.\\nThis survey confirmed that simulation is a practical approach to model a complex system, and\\nwe present relevant literature on simulation methodology in Section 2.3.\\n2.1 Perishable Inventory Management for Single-Echelon Systems\\nThe origin of all perishable inventory system analysis can be traced back to the simple Newsboy\\nmodel, in which the product lifetime is exactly one period and the order quantity decision is\\nindependent in each period. Both Van Zyl (1964) and Nahmias and Pierskalla (1973) derived\\noptimal policies for products with fixed lifetimes of two periods and stochastic demand. Van Zyl\\nderived dynamic programming functional equations that consider ordering costs and shortage\\ncosts. Nahmias and Pierskalla approach the issue by considering the outdating and shortages\\ncosts. Fries (1975) and Nahmias (1975) extended the literature to consider products with\\nlifetime beyond two periods with stochastic demand.\\nAs Nahmias (1982) explains, the main challenge in managing perishable inventory lies in\\ntracking inventories of different age-groups at each position in the supply chain. Thus, when a\\nproduct lifetime becomes greater than three periods, models become multi-dimensional and\\ncomputationally extensive. Because computation of optimal policies for such systems becomes\\nimpractical for everyday business decisions, approximations are potentially good alternative\\nchoices. Cohen (1976) developed an optimal critical number policy by using the stationary\\ndistribution of stock levels and then finding the critical number of periods' worth of demand to\\norder that minimizes the expected cost. However, when the product lifetime is greater than three\\nperiods, obtaining the stationary distribution of the starting stock becomes very challenging.\\nNahmias (1976) eased the computation by developing a heuristic critical number approximation\\napproach for products with fixed lifetime and stochastic demand. This approximation model was\\nproven to result in costs that are generally less than one percent higher than the global optimal\\ncost. Nahmias (1977) and Nahmias (1978) extended the approximation technique for products\\nwith random lifetimes and for systems with a set-up cost.\\n2.2 Perishable Inventory Management for Multi-Echelon Systems\\nClark and Scarf (1960) were the first to model the optimal policy for a multi-period, multi-\\nechelon inventory system subjected to stochastic demand. Since then extensive research has\\nbeen done on multi-echelon inventory systems, yet research on multi-echelon inventory systems\\nfor perishable products is still limited due to its complexity. Yen (1965) was the first to consider\\na perishable inventory policy in a multi-echelon system using a stationary critical number order\\npolicy. Yen assumed that each regional location always receives the same proportional age of\\ninventory according to its order quantity. Cohen, Pierskalla and Yen (1981) discussed periodic\\nreview policies which focus on inventory allocation for a multi-echelon system that differentiates\\nproducts by age. Their model did not remove the over-age stock from the inventory, but the\\npenalty cost associated with over-age stock was set sufficiently high to ensure small volumes of\\nover-age stock in the system. Matta and Sinha (1995) investigated the periodic review of a two-\\nechelon system for non-perishable products. Kanchanasuntorn and Techanitisawad (2006)\\nextended Matta and Sinha's model to include perishable items with fixed lifetimes using an\\napproximate periodic review policy.\\nThere is limited research on multi-echelon inventory management systems for perishable\\nproducts with a maximum fixed lifetime beyond three periods and a random lifetime with decay\\naccording to a probability distribution. To our knowledge, when the scope is further narrowed\\ndown to a multi-echelon system that uses periodic review and considers lost sales, shrinkage,\\nstochastic demand, non-zero lead-times and forecast accuracy, no relevant models have been\\npublished. Because of this and the fact that analytical approaches are generally complex and\\ndifficult to implement for day-to-day operations, we felt that simulation would be a better\\napproach to capture Chiquita's supply chain. In Section 2.3, we discuss the simulation modeling\\nbriefly.\\n2.3 Simulation\\nAlthough an analytical approach is generally the preferred method in developing inventory\\npolicies, it becomes intractable when the states of the inventory are too complex to be expressed\\nin equations. While analytical approaches may be impractical for a complex inventory system,\\ncomputer simulation modeling can help to keep track of the states of the inventory and monitor\\nthe interaction between the changes in each echelon of the supply chain.\\nWhite and Ingalls (2009) define a model as an entity that is used to represent some other\\nentity for some defined purpose. Models are used when direct investigation of the actual system\\nis impractical or expensive. They describe simulation as an experimental approach to studying\\nmodels. A simulation modeler first creates a model that imitates the behaviors of the actual\\nsystem, then experiments with the models with different inputs to observe the behavior, and at\\nlast tries to understand, summarize, and generalize that behavior. Because simulation modeling\\nhelps researchers understand the behavior of complex models in a cost-effective way, simulation\\nhas gained popularity and been widely used for academic research as well as for solving real-\\nworld problems. For example, Snyder and Shen (2006) used simulation models to gain insights\\non the differences between supply uncertainty and demand uncertainty in multi-echelon supply\\nchains. Schmitt and Singh (2009) constructed a model that helps a large consumer products\\ncompany to understand its vulnerability to disruption risk and the potential impact to customer\\nservice.\\nUsing a simulation model also helps to test the impact of increases in variability, widely\\nknown as the bullwhip effect phenomenon, on the forecast-driven multi-echelon system. Simchi-\\nLevi (2000) defines the bullwhip effect as the increase in demand variability as the demand\\ntravels up in a supply chain. The bullwhip effect is caused by multiple factors, including order\\nbatching and miscommunication of customers' true demand throughout the supply chain.\\nLaw (2003) provided a concise yet comprehensive guide on conducting a successful\\nsimulation study. He discusses several key steps to developing a successful simulation study.\\nThese key steps are:\\n1. Formulate the problem. Simulation modeling typically starts with formulating the\\nproblem, defining the overall objective of the study and listing the specific questions that\\nthe study needs to address.\\n2. Construct a conceptual simulation model. Once the objective is clearly defined, modelers\\ncan begin constructing the conceptual model. Modelers first need to collect information\\nto understand the system structure, and collect data to specify model parameters and\\nprobability distributions. With a good understanding of the system structure and model\\nparameters, modelers can compile all the information to create a conceptual model.\\n3. Validate the conceptual model. Once a conceptual model is built, all parties involved\\nshould validate the model by walking through the conceptual model to ensure it is an\\naccurate representation of the system.\\n4. Program the model. With the granted validity of the model, modelers can begin to\\nprogram the conceptual model in programming language or in a commercial simulation-\\nsoftware product.\\n5. Validate the programmed model. While programming the model, modelers should\\nvalidate the model with the existing system and perform sensitivity analyses to gain\\ninsights on the model factors\\n6. Conduct and analyze simulation experiments. This step is to determine the details on\\nhow to run the simulations, such as simulation run length, length of the warm-up period,\\nand the number of independent runs. With all the steps completed, modelers can start\\nconducting simulation runs and analyze the results of each run.\\n7. Document andpresent the simulation results. After an adequate number of simulation\\nruns has been conducted, modelers should document the model and the simulation results\\nin details and in a fashion that is easy to understand for the targeted audience.\\n2.4 Summary\\nGiven the complex challenges that Chiquita's Fresh Express supply chain faces, we determined\\nthat a simulation approach is more suitable than an analytical approach for the purpose of this\\nresearch. We used Law's approach as the reference guidelines for developing our simulation\\nmodel and describe that process in Chapter 3, and we document and present the simulation\\nresults in Chapter 4. The details of the conceptual flow and user manual can be found in\\nAppendix A and B respectively.\\n3 Methodology\\nIn this chapter, we outline how we developed a simulation model using Arena Simulation\\nSoftware developed by Rockwell Automation to capture Chiquita's Fresh Express multi-echelon\\nsupply chain. We explain how we used the simulation model to better understand the impact of\\nperishability on costs and service levels. We include additional details on the conceptual flow of\\nsimulation model in Appendix A and the user guide in Appendix B.\\nIn order to develop a simulation model that replicates the Fresh Express supply chain, we\\nfirst investigated the standard practices, performance metrics, and challenges that exist in the\\nsupply chain. We determined the assumptions that we must make in order to develop the model\\nand the data that we would use to run the simulation. After we gained a good understanding of\\nthe key elements and data available in the Fresh Express supply chain, we began to build a\\nconceptual model to capture all the processes involved in this multi-echelon supply chain. Once\\nthe conceptual model was built and validated, we transformed the conceptual model into a\\nsimulation model in Arena. After we programmed the simulation model in Arena and created a\\ntesting plan, we were ready to conduct simulation runs to investigate the optimal inventory\\npolicy and the sensitivity of the costs.\\nWe use several abbreviations throughout this chapter and subsequent chapters. The\\ncomplete list of abbreviations and their definitions can be found in Table C. 1 of Appendix C.\\nRecall that due to confidentiality concerns, all the numbers used throughout the thesis are for\\nillustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of actual performance at Chiquita.\\n3.1 Problem Formulation\\nUsing Law's approach as our reference guideline (Law, 2003), discussed in Section 2.3, we\\nstarted our research by interviewing the supply chain managers at Chiquita to understand the\\nbusiness processes, the material and information flows, and the challenges facing the Fresh\\nExpress product line. As mentioned in the Introduction, we focused our analysis on Chiquita's\\nplant in Georgia, ABC's DC in Florida, and ABC's retail stores served by the Florida DC. We\\ngathered information on the existing inventory replenishment process and the performance\\nmetrics, namely the inventory shrinkage and the service levels, to understand the standard\\npractices of this supply chain. We then determined the necessary assumptions that we needed to\\nmake to build our simulation model. We also mapped out what data is available and how the\\ndata should be used in the model. The details of these steps are discussed in the following\\nsections.\\n3.1.1 Inventory Replenishment\\nAt the end of each day, each retail store reviews its inventory position (IP) and places an order to\\nmaintain an inventory level of two or three days of on-hand inventory. If inventory is available,\\nthe DC typically will fulfill each order within 24 hours. The replenishment of the DC's\\ninventory is managed directly by Chiquita through ABC's Vendor Management Inventory (VMI)\\nsystem. Supply chain managers at Chiquita review the IP at ABC's DC five times a week and\\nplace appropriate orders to Chiquita's plant. Presently, Chiquita reviews the DC's IP every day\\nexcept on Wednesdays and Fridays. For the purpose of further discussions, we will refer the\\nactivities that Chiquita performs (as a part of VMI) on behalf of the DC as the DC's activities.\\n3.1.2 Inventory Shrinkage\\nAll the Fresh Express products carry a production date stamp. After 14 days from the production\\ndate, the product is considered no longer fresh for a consumer to purchase. At the end of each\\nday, each ABC store removes and disposes any products produced 14 days ago from the shelf or\\nthe inventory and considers the loss as inventory shrinkage costs.\\n24\\nAdditionally, each store also removes and disposes any products that age more quickly\\nthan the expected 14-day of shelf life based on their appearance. The probability of a product\\nneeding to be disposed prior to reaching the full 14 days increases as it ages. Based on the inputs\\nreceived from Chiquita supply chain managers and the results from our initial simulation runs,\\nwe determined that an exponential growth probability best matches the shrinkage that Chiquita\\nexperiences in reality. More information on this distribution is provided in Section 4.1.\\nThe inventory shrinkage costs at the retail stores are absorbed by ABC itself, but high\\ninventory shrinkage costs could potentially damage the business relationship between ABC and\\nChiquita. Currently, the total shrinkage at the retail stores is between 10 to 13% of the total\\nshipment volume from the DC to the retail stores, the goal is to reduce the shrinkage volume to\\n8.5%.\\nAt the DC, ABC has mandated an aging inventory shrinkage policy, in which ABC does\\nnot ship any products that have less than six days of shelf life remaining from the DC to the\\nstores. ABC removes and discards any products produced eight days ago from inventory, and it\\ncharges the loss back to Chiquita. Thus both ABC and Chiquita share a common interest in\\ncontrolling the inventory levels in a way that the potential inventory shrinkages are minimized at\\nboth the retail stores and the DC.\\n3.1.3 Service Levels\\nAlthough both Chiquita and ABC would like to minimize inventory shrinkage, they also need to\\nmaintain sufficient inventory levels as both of them strive for high customer service levels. The\\ntarget average item fill rate (IFR) at the DC is 95%, which is calculated as the total demand\\nfulfilled by the DC over the total quantity requested by each retail store on a daily basis. Any\\nunfulfilled demand at the DC is recorded against Chiquita's performance, and any unfulfilled\\ndemand at the retail store is considered lost sales.\\nPresently ABC uses an \\\"In Stock or Out of Stock\\\" binary metric to measure the service\\nlevels at the retail stores. ABC considers an item at the store to be \\\"In Stock\\\" when the store has\\nenough inventory to fulfill the daily average demand; otherwise, it is considered \\\"Out of Stock\\\".\\nFor example, if 85 stores out of 100 stores have enough inventory to cover their daily demand for\\nan item, the service level for that item is 85%. However, for a store that does not have enough\\ninventory to cover its daily demand, the current \\\"In Stock or Out of Stock\\\" binary metric does\\nnot capture the partial demand fulfillment by the store. After careful consideration and discussion\\nwith Chiquita supply chain managers, we believe that an IFR would be a more appropriate metric\\nfor measuring true service levels at the retail stores. Therefore we use an IFR metric in the\\nmodel and assume that Chiquita would still require a 95% IFR at the retail level.\\nGiven the high demand volatility for packaged salads, the current forecasts generated by\\neach store and the DC each have a mean absolute percentage error of 25%. As a result, the DC\\nand the retail stores often have to carry excessive inventory in order to ensure a high customer\\nservice level. The main challenge for the Fresh Express supply chain is how to balance the\\ntradeoff between potential inventory shrinkage costs, potential lost sales costs, and inventory\\nholding costs. In order to minimize these costs, Chiquita must understand how perishability\\nimpacts the inventory levels and the dynamics between all the factors in the system.\\n3.1.4 Assumptions\\nIn our model, we include two retail stores served by ABC's DC in Florida. These two retail\\nstores could represent actual stores, or they could represent two separate demand streams\\naggregated from multiple stores. We assume that the Chiquita plant does not have any raw\\nmaterial shortage or capacity constraints at the plant; in other words, Chiquita is always able to\\nproduce and supply the quantity required by ABC's DC. Hence, Chiquita's production plant is\\nnot part of our research.\\nOur model replicates ABC's and Chiquita's standard ordering practices, in which the DC\\nand the retail stores use a base-stock policy for replenishments. A base-stock policy implies a\\nperiodic review policy, in which the DC and the retail stores each have an Order-Up-To-Level\\n(OUL) for each product. The DC places orders five times a week and the retail stores place\\norders every period, where a period is one day.\\nOur model assumes the product demand to be stochastic and normally distributed with a\\nknown mean and variance. We feel justified this assumption because the normal distribution is\\ncommonly used in many models in the literature. Additionally, the demand used in the model\\ncan represent an aggregation of multiple individual products and/or stores, and the central limit\\ntheorem states that the mean sum of a large number of random variables will have a normal\\ndistribution. Additionally, we assume that the demand at each retail store is independent from\\neach other.\\nWe assume that a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) policy is followed for the inventory at the\\nretail stores and the DC. A FIFO policy implies that older products are sold first to reduce\\npossible shrinkage. Although at the retail stores certain consumers may pick younger products\\navailable from the back of the shelf over older products displayed in front, such consumer\\nbehavior is difficult to predict and too complicated to incorporate in the scope of this thesis. We\\nalso assume that the DC treats all the retail stores equally and does not prioritize a particular\\nstore over another.\\nThe transportation lead time from the DC to the retail stores is assumed to be constant at\\none day (overnight), which means when the store places the order at the end of the day, if the\\nstock is available, the order will arrive at the store the next morning, in time to be available for\\nsale that day. The transportation lead time from the plant to the DC is assumed to be\\ndeterministic and constant for each simulation. However, it is formulated as an input parameter\\nso that the model can test the sensitivity of the transportation lead time from the plant to the DC.\\nRecall that the production lead time at the plant is 4 days.\\n3.1.5 Information Flow and Input Calculations\\nFigure 3.1 below illustrates the information flow and the calculations conducted using the input\\ndata specified by the user. We explain the logic below.\\nRetail Store 1 Chiquita/DC Retail Store 2\\nDaily Apply Forecast Apply Foens Apple\\no Error (MAPE)Ero(AEErrMP)\\nrD\\nfoecutri 3.1 HanfomtinFlwan2nptCaclain\\nAt~Apl Forcas Apl F tr tRtiIS ore cs\\nforcas ina Lee,(+) frcs in O nHad2.\\nFigure ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~ Fn 3.1: Inomto8lo n nu Cluai\\nWe programmed Microsoft Excel to generate the random daily demands for each retail\\nstore using the mean and standard deviation obtained from the Point-Of-Sale (POS) data. The\\n28\\n.... ....... ... ... ..........\\nrandom daily demand is used as the actual daily demand realized at each store. We then apply\\nthe forecast error (mean absolute percentage error, MAPE) to this demand and errantly obtain the\\ndaily demand forecast.\\nWe create the daily demand forecast using a uniformly-distributed random multiplier.\\nWe generate the multiplier using a minimum and maximum value range. Since the forecast\\nerrors can be either positive or negative, the maximum value is two times the given MAPE, and\\nthe minimum value is negative two times the given MAPE. Using Excel, uniformly-distributed\\nrandom numbers are generated between the minimum and maximum values. This means the\\naverage of the multiplier is equal to zero but the average of the absolute value of the multiplier is\\nequal to the MAPE. This random number is multiplied by the daily demand, thus providing the\\ndaily demand forecast. By measuring the forecast accuracy weighted across the total volume, we\\nverify if the given forecast error was correctly translated. Even though in our calculation we use\\nthe daily demand to produce the demand forecast, this daily demand forecast is used in the model\\nas the forecasts generated by each store prior to the arrival of the actual daily demand.\\nThe OUL for each retail store is determined by the target days of on-hand inventory. The\\nuser inputs the target number of days of inventory, and then the actual daily OUL is calculated\\nby adding the demand forecast for that number of days forward. For example, if the inventory\\npolicy at the retail store is 2.5 days of on-hand inventory, the OUL would be the sum of the\\ndemand forecast for the next 2.5 days. Depending on the IP at the time of the review, each retail\\nstore would place an individual order equal to the OUL minus the IP, or equal to zero if that\\nsubtraction yields a negative value. The IP is the on-hand inventory level after satisfying\\ndemand minus the shrinkage. Since the order placed at the end of the day would arrive the next\\nmorning, there is no shipment in transit needed to be included in calculating the IP for the retail\\nstores.\\nTo calculate the daily demand forecast at the DC, we apply the forecast error to the\\naggregated daily demand from the retail stores. The actual daily demand realized at the DC is\\nthe aggregated total of individual orders from each retail store.\\nThe OUL for the DC is determined using the same technique used to calculate the OUL\\nfor the retail stores. The OUL for the DC is determined by the target days on-hand inventory at\\nthe DC and the total lead time from placing the order to Chiquita's plant to the delivery of the\\nshipment. For example, if the target on-hand inventory at the DC is one day and the lead time\\nfor Chiquita to fulfill an order is five days, the OUL at the DC would be the sum of the demand\\nforecast for the next six days. Depending on the IP, the DC would place an order equal to the\\nOUL minus the IP, or again equal to zero if that subtraction yields a negative value. The IP for\\nthe DC is the on-hand inventory level after satisfying demand, minus the shrinkage, plus the\\nshipments in transit to the DC.\\nIn Figure 3.1, the numbers marked in red are input parameters that can be changed for\\neach simulation run. The input data is generated by a user in an Excel file and the simulation\\nmodel reads the data from this Excel file. The use of Excel file allows Chiquita to use the model\\nto simulate other multi-echelon Fresh Express supply chains by simply changing the input\\nparameters there.\\n3.2 Conceptual Model\\nThe information captured during the Problem Formulation step was critical for us to understand\\nChiquita's supply chain system and decide the appropriate parameters, performance metrics, and\\nlevel of detail for the model. Next we developed a generic conceptual model that details the\\nlogic of the system and would be applicable to most other multi-echelon systems within\\nChiquita.\\n3.2.1 Model Logic-Flow\\nWe compiled the information captured during the interviews with Chiquita's Fresh Express\\nsupply chain managers and divided the processes into eight steps. Figure 3.2 provides a\\nsummary of the eight steps in the conceptual flow of our simulation model and we detail the\\nlogic for each step below. We explain more details of each step in Appendix A using additional\\nflow charts.\\nStep 1 Step 2 Step3 Step4\\nr - . -\\nStep5 Step6 Ste p 7 Step8\\nFigure 3.2: Overview of Conceptual Flow\\nStep 1\\nConsumers purchase products at the retail stores on any given day, depleting the inventory using\\na FIFO product policy. At the end of each day, the retail stores remove the perished products\\n... . ..........\\nfrom their inventory. Since backorders are not allowed in the system, any unfulfilled consumer\\ndemand at the retail stores is considered lost sales.\\nStep 2\\nThe retail stores operate on a daily periodic-review policy with an OUL. At the end of the day,\\neach retail store checks its IP against the OUL and, if necessary, places an order to the DC.\\nStep 3\\nAfter aggregating the individual orders received from the two retail stores, the DC fulfills the\\norders using a FIFO product policy for the inventory depletion on any given day. The order\\nfulfillment and inventory allocation for each retail store follows an order-splitting algorithm in\\norder to allocate material logically. The detail of this algorithm used in the model can be found in\\nSection A. 1 of Appendix A.\\nStep 4\\nThe products shipped from the DC are received by the retail stores the morning after the order is\\nplaced. Since the maximum shelf life of a Fresh Express product is 14 days, in the simulation\\nmodel we created 14 virtual bins at the retail stores. Each bin contains Fresh Express products\\nwith distinct age-groups. For example, Bin 1 contains products that are one day old at the retail\\nstore, Bin 2 contains products that are two day old at the retail store, etc. Using the different\\ninventory age bins, we ensure the accurate measure of shelf life, appropriate inventory transfers,\\nand accurate calculation of shrinkage costs.\\nThe bin age at the retail store does not include the transportation lead times; in other\\nwords, the actual shelf life of the product is its bin age at the retail store plus the transportation\\nlead time from the plant to the DC and from the DC to the retail store. For example, if the DC\\nhas products that are 10 days old and it ships these products to the retail stores, we add that stock\\nto the appropriate bin 11 at the retail stores as the actual shelf life must consider the one day\\ntransportation lead time from the DC to the retail store. This allows for flexibility of lead time\\ninput parameters; the model structure does not have to change in order to test different shipment\\nlead times to the DC.\\nEach bin at the retail stores is assigned a shrinkage probability according to the true\\nproduct age, so that every day a percentage of products in each bin may be discarded. These\\ndiscarded products are unusable due to perishability.\\nStep 5\\nThe DC periodically reviews its IP and creates an order to Chiquita's plant if the IP at the DC is\\nless than its OUL, as mentioned in Section 3.1.1.\\nStep 6\\nThe DC receives a shipment from the plant according to production and transportation lead\\ntimes. For example, if the total production and transportation lead time is five days, the DC will\\nreceive the shipment from the plant in the morning of the fifth day after the day when the order\\nwas placed. Using the same approach described for the retail stores, we created 14 virtual bins at\\nthe DC in the simulation model. The model conducts the inventory transfer in the same manner\\nas was described for the retail stores in Step 4.\\nThe model also provides flexibility for users to change the review schedule if needed. In\\nother words, instead of reviewing the IP at the DC every day except Wednesday and Friday, the\\nusers may change the model to review the IP based on a different review schedule.\\nStep 7\\nAt the end of each day, relevant costs and Key Performance Indexes (KPIs), as listed below, are\\ncaptured and measured for each retail store and the DC. Lost Sales Cost is not considered at the\\nDC because ABC operates its DC as a cost center, not a profit center. The DC charges a fee for\\nproducts shipped to the retail stores, but the margin is only used to cover the warehousing and\\nshipping expenses and not considered a sales profit. Hence, any unfulfilled demand at the DC is\\nnot charged a lost sales cost. However, as explained in Section 3.1.3, the DC does require that it\\nmaintains an average IFR of 95%.\\nRelevant Costs:\\n\\\" Holding Costs\\n\\\" Shrinkage Costs\\n* Lost Sales Costs\\nKPIs:\\n\\\" Item Fill Rate\\ne Shrinkage Units\\n* Lost Sales Units\\n* Inventory Positions\\n* Inventory Levels\\nDifferent test scenarios are needed to compare these costs and KPIs, and to evaluate the\\ntrade-offs between them. The objective is to find the parameters that result in the lowest total\\nrelevant cost while satisfying the minimum IFR.\\nStep 8\\nAt the end of each day, any inventory left at the retail stores and the DC ages by one day. In\\nother words, the product shelf life remaining is reduced by one day. In the model, we shuffle\\ninventory bins or transfer the inventory to the next bin to ensure accurate measure of product age\\nand associated shrinkage costs. For example, at the end of the day, products that are 3 days old\\nwill now become 4 days old; products that are 4 days old will now become 5 days old, etc.\\nProducts that are 14 days old will no longer be considered fresh for consumers to purchase and\\nwill be discarded as shrinkage.\\nAdditionally, as mentioned in Section 3.1.2, some products may age more quickly than\\nthe expected 14-day of shelf life. Thus a fraction of the products would be removed from the\\ninventory according to the shrinkage profile.\\n3.2.2 Validation\\nAfter we mapped out the eight steps in the process, we presented the conceptual model to\\nChiquita's supply chain managers who validated that the model accurately represents the Fresh\\nExpress supply chain. We also validated the model flow with supply chain and simulation\\nexperts that include faculty and students at MIT.\\n3.3 Model Programming\\nWe programmed the conceptual model using Arena, a discrete-event systems simulation\\nsoftware. We choose Arena because we have previous experience with the software and\\nChiquita already has licenses to Arena. In addition, Arena integrates well with Microsoft Office;\\nthe users can have Arena read and write from or to Excel spreadsheets, making Arena more user-\\nfriendly for day-to-day business operations.\\nFigure 3.3 below shows the screen shots of our simulation model programmed in Arena.\\nThe top section of the figure highlighted in red represents the logic for the retail stores. The\\nmiddle portion of the figure represents the logic for the DC, The section of the figure highlighted\\nin yellow represents the logic for the order creation process at the plant by the DC. Finally, the\\nbottom section of the figure represents the process in Arena to read the input parameters from\\nand write the outputs into the Excel file. Please refer to Appendix A for the more details of\\nsimulation model in Arena.\\nFigure 3.3: Arena Model Screen Shot\\n3.4 Arena Model Verification and Validation\\nWe verified and validated the Arena model to ensure that the model sufficiently matches reality\\nand performs according to the intended design. We verified the model by monitoring whether\\n. .... ...... ... ...........\\njiwj r1i J-j I-j 1--i\\nthe model behaves as expected under different circumstances to ensure the conceptual model was\\ncorrectly translated into the Arena model. For example, we raised the inventory level at the\\nretails stores and subsequently saw higher shrinkage volumes and holding costs at the retail\\nstores.\\nWe validated the programmed model with supply chain managers from Chiquita and\\nsupply chain experts at the MIT. The experts were convinced that our programmed model\\nsufficiently matches with the reality of Chiquita's Fresh Express supply chain system.\\nAdditionally, we validated the model by comparing outputs from the simulation model with\\nhistorical performance metrics provided by Chiquita. We discuss the results in Chapter 4.\\n3.5 Simulation Testing\\nFor our research, twenty independent simulation replications was deemed to be a sufficient\\nnumber for producing results with tight enough 95% confidence intervals for performance\\nmetrics. The duration of each simulation run was 365 days, or one year. The system produced\\nstable results after the simulation ran for thirty days, thus we determined the warm-up period for\\nour model should be thirty days. For more details on the simulation run parameters, please refer\\nto Appendix B.\\nWe developed a testing plan containing different scenarios specifically to answer the\\nthree key questions described in Section 1.2. Our testing plan focused on finding the optimal\\ninventory policies for the retail stores and the DC. Once we determined the inventory policies\\nthat resulted in the lowest total relevant costs while meeting the minimum IFR, we tested the\\nsensitivity of the system to different percentage of forecasting errors and different transportation\\nlead times from the plant to the DC.\\nWe used the aggregated demands from one of Fresh Express' main product families to\\nconduct all our simulation runs based on a suggestion by Chiquita's supply chain managers. The\\nresults generated from using this product family should provide a good overall representation of\\nthe whole Fresh Express product lines.\\n4 Results\\nIn this chapter we discuss the results of our simulation runs and the interpretation of these\\nresults. Our objective was to find an optimal inventory policy that results in the lowest total\\nrelevant cost while satisfying the minimum IFR required at the retail stores and the DC. We also\\ntested the sensitivity of the system to better understand the potential impact of some of the input\\nparameters may have on the system under the optimal policy.\\nIn Section 4.1 we describe the input parameters and the base scenario details. In Section\\n4.2 we discuss the simulation results under different inventory levels at the retail stores and at the\\nDC and determine the optimal inventory solution. In Section 4.3 we test the sensitivity of the\\nsystem under the optimal policy to the forecast errors, and in Section 4.4 we test the sensitivity\\nof the system under the optimal policy to the transportation lead time from the plant to the DC.\\nIn Appendix D, we present additional results of the sensitivity analysis such as cost break-down\\nat each echelon.\\n4.1 Input Parameters and Base Scenario\\nTable 4.1 lists the retail stores' input parameters and their definitions.

The existing\\ninventory policy at the retail stores is to maintain 2.5 days of on-hand inventory.

This means that even for products that are less than 14 days old,\\nan exponentially increasing fraction of inventory is discarded at the end of each day due to\\nperishability. The exponentially growing shrinkage probabilities were obtained using Excel\\nSolver to find the parameter that should result in 10-13% shrinkage, which is in the range of the\\n................................... ::::..::::::::      .... ..... .. .  ..... \\nshrinkage percentage experienced at the retail stores in reality. Equation 4.1 presents the formula\\nfor X, which is the shrinkage probability for a given age. The parameter a is determined in terms\\nof k and the maximum value for t, the product shelf life, according to Equation 4.3. Thus Excel\\nSolver finds only one unknown parameter, k. In our case, the maximum product shelf life is 14\\ndays, resulting in 14 shrinkage probabilities.\\nX = aekt or In X = kt + In a (Equation 4.1)\\nk -In (Maximum Shrinkage Probability )-ln (Minimum Shrinkage Probability ) (Equation 4.2)\\nmaximum t-minimum t\\n_ Maximum Shrinkage Probability (Equation 4.3)\\ne^A(k * maximum t)\\nwhere\\nt is the current age/time interval for the product (in our model, the minimum t =1 and\\nmaximum t= 14)\\nk is the growth constant determined according to Equation 4.2\\na is determined according to Equation 4.3 and is the initial value of X\\nThe maximum shrinkage probability is 100%. Seeking a 12% total shrinkage volume,\\nusing Excel Solver, we obtained k=0.2535 and a=0.0287, which produce the appropriate\\nexponentially growing shrinkage probabilities from day 1 to day 14. Additionally, ABC's\\nmandated inventory shrinkage policy at the retail stores is to discard 100% of any product that\\nare 14 days old regardless the appearance of the product. Therefore, the value of parameter k\\nobtained by Excel Solver is such that we have an exponentially growing shrinkage profile from\\nday 1 to day 14 and we have 100% fixed shrinkage probability at day 14. The actual shrinkage\\nprobabilities obtained and used in the model are listed in Table 4.2.\\nWe ran the simulation for the base scenario with these shrinkage probabilities and\\nvalidated that these probabilities indeed produce aggregated total shrinkage volume at the retail\\nstores within the valid range of 10% to 13%.

However, we conducted the simulation using actual numbers for base\\nscenario. The existing inventory policy at the DC is to maintain 1 day of on-hand inventory.\\n. ....................................................\\n............ ..\\nHowever, since the lead time from when the order is placed to Chiquita's plant until the order is\\ndelivered to the DC is five days, Chiquita must maintain a total six day worth of inventory in the\\npipeline. The DC does not check the appearance of the products, thus the shrinkage probability\\nat the DC does not follow the exponentially growing shrinkage probability. The mandated\\ninventory shrinkage policy at the DC is to discard 100% of any product that have less than six\\ndays of shelf life remaining regardless the appearance of the product. Therefore, any product\\nthat has less than six days of shelf life remaining has a shrinkage probability of 100%.

We then performed simulation tests by varying both target inventory levels\\nsimultaneously to determine overall optimal multi-echelon inventory levels. An optimal solution\\nmeans the inventory levels resulted in the lowest total relevant costs for the system, which is the\\nsum of the inventory holding costs, the lost sales costs, and the shrinkage costs, while satisfying\\nthe minimum IFR (95%) at the DC.\\n4.2.1 Inventory at the Retail Stores\\nWe first ran the simulation with the base scenario inputs from Tables 4.2 and 4.5, then we held\\nthe DC inventory level constant and changed the days of on-hand inventory levels at the retail\\nstores to understand at which values the inventory policy would result in reasonable costs yet\\nstill satisfy the minimum requirement of 95% IFR. We tested the target days on hand inventory\\nlevels at the retail stores in the increments of /2 integer values between 2 to 5 days. We tested\\nthe increments of % integer values because those are the smallest possible increments that ABC\\noperates with, and we set the minimum at % of a day because the store would not accept\\ncomplete stock-outs and always need some inventory on hand to satisfy demand.\\nTable 4.6 presents the total relevant costs at different values of target days on-hand\\ninventory and Figure 4.1 and 4.2 graphs the results. We can see that if we only consider the\\nretail stores, 1.5 days of on-hand inventory results the lowest cost and still satisfies the\\nrequirement of 95% IFR.\\nTable 4.6: Inventor Targets at the Retail Stores\\nTarget OnHand Days at Retal Stom 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\\nDCIFR 99.1 99.6 98.4 95.3 91.7 85.9 80.5 73.3 66.1 58.2\\nDCIL 460.8 371.6 285.0 252.4 227.6 205.9 185.7 171.3 159.8 155.3\\nDCTotalRelewntCost $144.76 $84.64 $60.06 $52.85 $47.28 $42.58 $38.25 $35.21 $32.80 $31.89\\nRetail1TotalRelewntCost $130.44 $60.47 $26.99 $37.37 $50.64 $62.12 $72.27 $80.55 $87.57 $91.17\\nRetail2TotalRelemntCost $67.17 $32.42 $15.05 $20.85 $28.36 $35.73 $42.56 $49.08 $55.13 $60.95\\nRetailllFR 56.6 85.2 98.1 99.4 99.5 99.5 99.7 99.6 99.7 99.7\\nRetaillIL 3.2 27.8 53.5 89.3 123.9 153.5 181.7 204.0 223.4 234.1\\nRetail2lFR 57.6 85.5 98.3 99.7 99.9 99.9 99.9 100.0 100.0 100.0\\nRetail2lL 2.0 15.2 29.4 49.1 68.5 87.6 105.7 123.0 139.2 154.3\\nSystemTotalRelexentCost $342.37 $177.53 1i0. $111.07 $126.28 $140.43 $153.08 $164.84 $175.51 $184.02\\nItem Fill Rate Vs Target OnHand days\\n100 0\\n90 _\\n80\\n-+-DCIFR\\nE 70 -0-Retaill FR\\n6r-Retail2lFR\\n60\\n50\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\\nTarget OnHand Days at Retail Store\\nFigure 4.1: Effects of Inventory Targets at the Retail Stores on IFR\\n$400 Cost Vs Target OnHand Days\\n$350\\n$300\\n$250\\nin CDCTotalIReleva ntCost\\nS$200 __\\n0 =W- Retail lTotalRelevantCost\\n$150\\n-Retail2TotalRelevantCost\\n$100 \\n- SystemTotaReevantCost\\n$50\\n$0\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\\nTarget OnHand Days at Retail Store\\nFigure 4.2: Effects of Inventory Targets at the Retail Stores on Cost\\n.. .. . ................................ ............... \\nFigure 4.1 shows the effect of target on-hand inventory level at the retail stores on the\\nIFR at each echelon. As the target on-hand inventory at the retail stores increases, the IFRs at\\nthe retail stores increases and the IFR at the DC decreases. Our analysis indicates that the IFR at\\nthe DC decreases with increasing target on-hand inventory levels at the retail stores because the\\nstores order farther into the future with less accuracy which means the DC's ability to fill orders\\naccurately is reduced. The shape of curve suggests that the IFRs at the retail stores remain above\\n95% for target on-hand days that are greater than 1.5 when the base on-hand inventory target of 1\\nday is used at the DC.\\nConsidering Figure 4.2, we observe a clearly convex curve with the optimal solution\\nachieved when the target on-hand inventory is equal to 1.5 days. For the target on-hand days\\nless than 1.5 days, the total relevant cost for the system is higher due to higher lost sales costs at\\nthe retail stores and higher inventory holding costs at the DC. For the target on-hand days\\ngreater than 1.5, the total relevant cost for the system increases as a result of the increases of the\\ninventory holding costs and the shrinkage costs.\\nBased on the costs and IFRs observed, we determined that the reasonable range for target\\non-hand inventory at the retail stores is between 2 to 4.5 days. This is because for target on-\\nhand days greater than 4.5, the IFRs at the retail store remain relatively constant but the total\\nrelevant cost for retail stores and the system increases.\\n4.2.2 Inventory at the DC\\nUsing the same approach described for the retails stores, we changed only the days of on-hand\\ninventory at the DC and held the retailer levels constant at their base value (2.5 days). We tested\\nthe target inventory levels at the DC in the increments of 1/2 integer values between 0 to 5 days.\\nTable 4.7 presents the total relevant costs at different values of target days on-hand inventory at\\nthe DC.

The shape of curve suggests that the IFR at the DC remains above 95% for\\ntargets of on-hand days that are greater than 1.5 days.\\nThe cost curves for both the DC and the system are increasing with the lowest-cost\\nsolution achieved when the target on-hand inventory at the DC is equal to 0 days. However, this\\nlowest-cost solution is not feasible because it does not satisfy the constraint of a minimum 95%\\nIFR at the DC. For the target on-hand days greater than 0, the total relevant cost for the system\\nincreases as a result of the increases of the inventory holding costs and the shrinkage costs at\\nboth the DC and the retail stores. As the target days on-hand inventory increases, the DC holds\\nmore inventory of an older age, which is then sent to the retail stores resulting in higher\\nshrinkage costs at the retail stores.\\nBased on the costs and IFRs observed, we determined that the reasonable range for target\\non-hand inventory at the DC is between 0 to 4.5 days. This is because for target on-hand days\\ngreater than 4.5, the IFR at the DC remains relatively constant but the total relevant cost for the\\nDC and the system shows an increasing trend. The major cost contribution comes from the\\nincreasing inventory holding cost at the DC.\\n4.2.3 Optimal Inventory at the Retail Stores and the DC\\nAlthough our simulation runs described in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 provide the optimal inventory\\npolicies at the retail stores and at the DC separately, these policies fail to consider the potential\\nimpact that the inventory levels have on each other. In order to find the global optimal inventory\\npolicy for the multi-echelon system, we must consider different combination of retail stores' and\\nDC's inventory policies. As explained in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, we used the individual\\nechelon optimization results to narrow down the number of possible combinations. We\\nconducted simulation testing to seek the combination of inventory policies at the retail store and\\nthe DC that would result in the lowest total relevant cost for the system while still meeting the\\nminimum 95% IFR required at the DC. Table 4.8 presents the total relevant costs at different\\nvalues of target days on-hand inventory at the retail stores and the DC, with feasible solutions\\n(those with IFRs greater than 95% at all echelons) highlighted in green. Table 4.9 presents the\\nassociated IFR at the DC. The base policy currently used by Chiquita is highlighted in red for\\nthese tables and all that follow.

This is consistent with current observations by Chiquita that their IFR values at the DC\\nare not satisfactory.\\nTables 4.10 and 4.11 indicate the IFRs at each retail store for different target on-hand\\nlevels. We observe that except for the combinations with cells marked in green (which indicate\\nthe feasible solution), the IFR at the retail stores deteriorates below 95%. Retail Store 2 has a\\nhigher IFR for lower values for target days on-hand inventory at the DC. This may be due to the\\nfact that its demand is half that of Retail Store 1 and thus a larger proportion of its orders may be\\nsatisfied in full by the DC. Clearly, the target on-hand inventory policy of less than 1.5 days at\\nthe retail stores results in the higher lost sales cost for the system increasing the total relevant\\ncost.\\nTable 4.10: Item Fill Rate at Retail Store 1\\nRetail Stores\\nTarget OnHand Days 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5\\n0 56.4 84.6 93.2 94.0 94.3 94.2 94.3 93.4 92.3\\n0.5 56.6 - 85.3 97.1 98.1 98.3 98.2 98.5 98.5 98.3\\n1.0 56.6 85.2 98.1 99.4 99.5 99.5 99.7 99.6 99.7\\n1.5 56.8 85.1 98.3 99.7 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9\\n2.0 56.8 84.9 98.4 99.8 99.9 99.9 100.0 100.0 100.0\\nDC 2.5 56.9 85.0 98.4 99.9 99.9 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\\n3.0 56.9 84.9 98.4 99.9 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\\n3.5 57.0 84.9 98.4 99.9 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\\n4.0 56.9 84.8 98.4 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\\n4.5 56.9 84.8 98.4 99.9 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\\n.. .... ......\\nne.\\nTable 4.11: Item Fill Rate at Retail Store 2\\nRetail Stores\\nTarget OnHand Days 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5\\n0 57.6 85.6 96.1 98.0 98.5 98.9 99.0 99.3 99.6\\n0.5 57.7 85.7 98.0 99.4 99.6 99.7 99.8 99.8 99.9\\n1.0 57.6 85.5 98.3 99.7 99.9 99.9 99.9 100.0 100.0\\n1.5 57.8 85.3 98.4 99.9 99.9 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\\n2.0 57.8 85.2 98.3 99.9 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\\n2.5 57.9 85.2 98.4 99.9 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\\n3.0 57.9 85.1 98.4 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\\n3.5 57.9 85.0 98.4 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\\n4.0 57.9 84.9 98.3 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\\n4.5 57.8 84.9 98.3 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\\nTable 4.12 indicates the retail stores' contribution to the total relevant cost of the system.\\nWe can see that for the cells marked in yellow, the retail stores have a bigger impact than the\\nimpact that DC has on the total relevant costs for the system.

Further, the smaller confidence\\nintervals for the IFR at the DC and the total relevant cost for the system indicate that optimal\\npolicy would improve the reliability of the performance of the system and yield the lowest cost\\nsolution as compared to the base policy.\\nThere is a small decrease in IFRs at the retail store under the optimal policy as compared\\nto the base policy, although these IFRs under the optimal policy are still greater than 95%. This\\nis because the optimal solution trades off the lost sales cost with the shrinkage costs and\\ninventory holding costs at the retail stores in order to find the lowest cost solution for the whole\\nsystem. For example, in the case of Retail Store 1, we see that the shrinkage cost is reduced\\nfrom $23.04 to $8.37 and the inventory holding costs are reduced from $26.16 to $10.48 when\\ncomparing the base policy with optimal policy respectively. The lost sales cost increases from\\n$1.45 for the base policy to $8.62 for the optimal policy. Overall, the total relevant cost at Retail\\nStore 1 is now $27.46 for the optimal policy as compared to $50.64 for the base policy, which\\ntranslates into cost reduction of $23.18. Additionally, the IFR under the optimal policy at the\\nRetail Store 1 is 97.05% which is still greater than 95%. This means under the base policy, the\\nmajor portion of the cost comes from the shrinkage costs and inventory holding costs.\\nConsidering the cost reductions across the whole system, the optimal policy yields a\\n30.7% reduction in costs while maintaining the IFR greater than 95% at each echelon. The\\nmodel optimizes the whole system by capturing the dynamic effects of perishability and\\ninventory levels at each echelon, resulting in significant savings without sacrificing the service\\nlevels.\\n4.3 Sensitivity to the Forecast Errors\\nUsing the optimal inventory policies obtained during the simulation runs described in Section\\n4.2.3, 0.5 days inventory target at the DC and 1.5 days inventory target at the retail stores, we\\ntested the sensitivity of the system to the forecast errors. Testing the sensitivity of the optimal\\ninventory policy with respect to the forecast errors demonstrates the potential benefits of\\nincreased forecast accuracy on reducing the inventory-related costs.\\n4.3.1 Forecast Error for DC's Demand Forecast\\nWe conducted the sensitivity analysis by conducting simulation runs with the following inputs\\nfor forecast error for the DC's demand: 0, 5, 15, 25, 35, 50, 65, and 80%. Table 4.19 presents\\nthe results for the effects of DC's forecast error on the costs and IFRs at each echelon.

The forecast accuracy at the DC has greater impact than the\\nforecast accuracy at the retail stores on the total relevant cost of the system. Because of the\\nproduction and transportation lead time at the plant, the system is more sensitive to the DC's\\nforecast error. The longer production and transportation lead time at the plant means more\\nforecast error will be taken into account while calculating the DC's OUL as opposed to\\ncalculations with shorter lead times. This translates into the increased inventory holding cost at\\nthe DC.\\nHowever, the forecast accuracy at the retail stores has a greater impact than the forecast\\naccuracy at the DC on DC's IFR. Even if the forecast accuracy at the DC is improved, if the\\nretail stores have poor forecast accuracy then the DC's IFR will still suffer and the total relevant\\n.. .. .....   . ......................  ....

The cost benefits will be maximized if the forecast accuracies at both the\\nretail stores and the DC are improved.\\n4.4 Sensitivity to Transportation Lead Time\\nTesting the sensitivity of the total relevant cost to the transportation lead time from the plant to\\nthe DC helps demonstrate the benefits of using expedited shipping services. We conducted this\\nexperiment with transportation lead times from the plant to the DC of 1 through 7 days. The\\nproduction lead time is constant at 4 days which results in a cumulative lead time from the plant\\nto the DC of 5 to 11 days. Recall that the cumulative lead time for base scenario is 5 days (4\\ndays of production and 1 day of transportation lead time).

As the transportation lead time increases, products' remaining life-time at the DC and retail\\nstores decreases, in turn increasing the shrinkage volume.

In\\nthis chapter we present the challenges for perishable inventory system in a multi-echelon supply\\nchain, the insights drawn from the use of our simulation model, and an outline for the future\\nextensions.\\n5.1 Challenges for Perishable Inventory Systems in a Multi-Echelon Supply Chain\\nThe major challenges in perishable inventory management systems reside in tracking the\\ninventory distribution of different age-groups. The multi-echelon system further complicates the\\nissue as the interaction between each echelon of the supply chain makes the issue dynamic and\\ndifficult to monitor and understand. Addressing these issues analytically requires extensive\\ncomputations, thus analytical approaches are usually impractical for day-to-day operations in a\\ncomplex inventory system.\\nUtilizing a simulation model is extremely useful in dealing with perishable inventory in\\nmulti-echelon supply chains because tracking the inventory distribution and the inventory\\ntransfer becomes relatively simple using computer software. A computer simulation model also\\nhelps the user to monitor the interactions and influence between each echelon of the supply\\nchain. Additional benefits of a simulation approach are that we can test the sensitivity of the\\nsystem to varying conditions, and that we can obtain 95% confidence intervals for the output\\nvariables, which indicate the reliability of the estimate.\\n5.2 Key Insights\\nWe have discussed many of our key results in Chapter 4, and we highlight key insights in this\\nsection.\\n5.2.1 Service Level at the DC vs. Inventory at the Retail Stores\\nThe simulations reveal that the IFR at the DC is sensitive to the target days on-hand inventory at\\nthe retails stores. As the target days on-hand inventory at the retail stores increases, the IFR at\\nthe DC decreases significantly. The dynamics of the demand variability, the forecast errors, and\\nthe shrinkage in the multi-echelon system amplify as the target days on-hand inventory at the\\nretail stores increases. As a result of the dynamics of these three factors, the IFR at the DC\\ndeteriorates when the target days on-hand inventory at the retail stores increases past two days.\\nThe model suggests the retail store to keep its inventory less than two days to minimize the\\nupstream impact of the demand variability, the forecast errors, the production schedule and the\\nshrinkage.\\n5.2.2 Base Scenario Policy vs. Optimal Inventory Policy\\nOne of the three key questions posed by Chiquita is what the optimal inventory levels are\\nconsidering forecast accuracy, transportation lead-time, inventory carrying cost, lost sales costs\\nand inventory shrinkage costs due to product perishability. Our simulation model considers all\\nthese factors and determines that the optimal inventory policy would be to set the target days on-\\nhand inventory to be 0.5 days at the DC and 1.5 days at the retail stores. Comparing this optimal\\nsolution to the current inventory policy, the inventory policy determined by our simulation model\\nreduces the total relevant cost by 30.7%, reduces the shrinkage below 8.5%, and maintains the\\nIFR above the required 95% at all echelons.\\nChiquita has been considering moving to a cross-dock policy at the DC, which means the\\nDC will not carry any inventory. Our model indicates that by removing inventory from the DC,\\na cross-dock policy would reduce the total relevant costs by approximately 0.05%. Comparing\\nwith the 30.7% cost saving from the optimal policy, an additional 0.05% saving is relatively\\ninsignificant. In addition, our model shows that the cross-dock policy would reduce the IFR at\\nboth the retail stores. In particular, the IFR at the Retail Store 1 would be reduced from 97.1% to\\n93.2%, below the target IFR of 95%. Therefore, based on the results, we would not recommend\\nChiquita and ABC to introduce a cross-dock policy at the DC unless it makes other changes to its\\nordering and logistics to maintain sufficient IFRs.\\n5.2.3 Service Levels vs. Inventory Cost\\nAnother question posed by Chiquita is the trade-off between service levels and inventory cost.\\nAs we expected, the service levels and inventory costs have a positive correlation. We determine\\nour model's optimal inventory policy by selecting the policy that results in the lowest total\\nrelevant cost and still meets the minimum service level of 95% IFR. The optimal inventory\\npolicy improves the IFR at the DC from 91.74% to 95.24%, while the IFR at the retail stores\\ndecreases from 99% to 97%.\\nAlthough the IFR at the retail stores decreases by approximately 2%, 97% is still\\nconsidered high customer service level. However, the impact of a reduction of 2% in IFR on\\nconsumer satisfaction and good-will are not captured in our model. Chiquita and ABC should\\ngain a better understanding of the potential impact on consumer behavior and future sales before\\nimplementing the optimal inventory policy suggested by our simulation model.\\nOverall, the 30.7% cost savings are significant enough for Chiquita and ABC to consider\\nreplacing the current inventory policy with the optimal inventory policy found in our model. The\\nmajority of the cost reduction comes from the reductions in inventory holding costs and\\ninventory shrinkage costs across the system, especially at the retail stores.\\nAdditionally, the confidence intervals (95%) determined by our model for the IFR and\\nthe total relevant cost for the system are tighter in the case of the optimal inventory policy as\\ncompared to the confidence intervals in the base scenario policy. The tighter confidence\\nintervals indicate less variability in the system performance.\\n5.2.4 Effect of Forecast Error on the Relevant Costs and the Service Level\\nThe third question posed by Chiquita is the effect of forecast error on inventory-related costs.\\nWe found that the system is very sensitive to forecast errors, especially the forecast errors from\\nthe DC. In general, as the forecast accuracy deteriorates, the IFR at the DC and the retail stores\\ndecreases and the relevant cost of the system increases. Therefore, Chiquita and ABC should\\nconsider investing significant efforts to improve the forecast accuracies at the DC and the retail\\nstores. Additionally, improving the forecast accuracy at the DC alone may not address the issue\\nsufficiently because the DC's inventory is ultimately impacted by the orders and forecasts\\ncreated by the retail stores. The IFR at the DC is more sensitive to the forecast error at the retail\\nstores than to the DC's forecast error. To maximize the cost savings and improve the\\nperformance of the whole system, we recommend that Chiquita work with ABC to\\nsimultaneously improve the forecast accuracy at both the DC and the retail stores.\\n5.2.5 Effect of Transportation Lead Time on the Relevant Costs and Service Level\\nThe system is sensitive to the transportation lead time since the transportation lead time directly\\nimpacts the products' lifetime at the DC and at the retail stores. Our model demonstrates that as\\nthe transportation lead time increases, the shrinkage in the system increases significantly. This\\nfurther results in the increased lost sales at the retail stores and reduced IFR at the retail stores\\n79\\nand the DC. Overall, the total relevant cost for the system increases and the IFR at each echelon\\ndeteriorates. Since the system is sensitive to the transportation lead time, Chiquita should not\\nrelax the current lead time and should continue to keep the transportation lead time as short as\\npossible to maximize the products' available lifetime at the DC and the retail stores.\\n5.3 Extension of the Model and Future Research\\nFurther research on perishable product supply chains can be conducted by relaxing the\\nassumptions of our model. We have demonstrated the benefits of quantitative approach to\\nimproving the service levels at each echelon and reducing the total relevant cost of the system.\\nFurther extension of our research by exploring the following possibilities can extend the benefits\\nto the perishable product supply chains.\\n5.3.1 Mandated Shrinkage Policy at the DC\\nCurrently, ABC has mandated an inventory shrinkage policy at the DC, in which any product\\nthat has less than six days of shelf life remaining should be removed from the DC's inventory.\\nTesting the sensitivity of the system with respect to this mandated inventory shrinkage policy at\\nthe DC could help Chiquita to understand the impact of this policy on the IFR at each individual\\nechelon and the total relevant cost for the system.\\n5.3.2 Other Product Families\\nOur simulation is based on one of Fresh Express' main product families. The results generated\\nfrom using this product family should provide a good overall representation of the whole Fresh\\nExpress product lines. However, Chiquita can use the simulation model to test other product\\nfamilies or each individual product to gain a deeper understanding of its supply chain.\\n5.3.3 Other Fresh Express Supply Chains\\nOur simulation is also based on one of Fresh Express' main customers, which we refer to as\\nABC Inc. This supply chain is similar to Chiquita's other supply chains for other customers.\\nHowever, some of the inventory policies, such as ABC's mandated shrinkage policy at the DC,\\nmight be different for other customer's supply chains. Chiquita can conceivably change the\\ninput parameters in the model to determine the optimal inventory policy for its other supply\\nchains.\\n5.3.4 Demand Correlation among Complementary Products\\nIn our model, we assumed independent demand that is normally distributed for each product, but\\ndifferent demand distributions can be considered for further research. For example, it is possible\\nto analyze and incorporate correlated demand for complementary products.\\n5.3.5 First In First Out Policy\\nOur model assumes a FIFO product policy; however, in reality if there are products with\\ndifferent lifetime displayed on the shelf, some consumers would look for and purchase the\\nyounger products. Such consumer behavior is not captured in our current model. Chiquita and\\nits customers can either develop rules to expand our model to capture such behaviors or develop\\nstore shelf stocking policies to better control consumers' purchasing behaviors if needed.\\n5.3.6 Production Capacity of the Plant\\nIn our model, we assumed that the plant has unlimited production capacity to fulfill DC's orders,\\nbut this assumption can be relaxed if an additional echelon is built into the model. This may be\\nvaluable since the plant serves other DC's if it has limited production capacity\\n5.4 Summary\\nWe conclude that for multi-echelon perishable inventory management problems, simulation can\\nbe extremely helpful. Our research demonstrates that simulation modeling can quantify various\\ntrade-offs involved in making inventory management decisions for perishable products. It is\\nextremely valuable to simulate reality and test the sensitivity of the system before decisions are\\nmade by managers. Simulation modeling can lead to optimal solutions that would reduce the\\nsystem costs significantly while improving the system performance significantly.\\nReference List\\nClark, A.

A Microsoft Excel file\\nwas used feed the input parameters into this Arena model. In this Excel file, the model user can\\nspecify the input parameters specific to each individual echelon of supply chain that we\\ndiscussed in Chapter 4. The Arena simulation model reads these input parameters before\\nrunning the simulation. To that end, we have integrated the Excel file with the Arena simulation\\nmodel.\\nAdditionally, the user needs to setup replication parameters for the Arena simulation\\nmodel. At the end of simulation runs, Arena provides results for the output variables using\\nArena's built-in reports. Users can also obtain results for the specific output variables at the\\nrequired level of granularity, provided a specific output file and the output format are specified to\\nthe model by the intended user. The sections below provide more details regarding the process\\ninvolved.\\nB.2 Setting Up the Model\\nThis section provides details regarding the input parameters to be specified by the model user.\\nB.2.1 Excel Input Parameters for the Supply Chain\\nAs mentioned in Section B. 1, the user needs to specify the input parameters specific to the\\nsupply chain in file the InputDataFile.xls. Figure B. 1 (a) shows the screenshot of this file and\\nthe input parameters to be specified by the user. The user needs to specify a valid data value for\\neach of the cells marked in yellow. We have defined a valid range for each of these input data\\ncells. If the user enters any incorrect value (for example, negative values) into these cells, an\\ninput error messages twill appear to the user. The user needs to resolve any errors that are\\nprompted before proceeding to the actual Arena simulation.\\nThe user is allowed to enter data only in the InputData tab. The TestMe tab as shown in\\nFigure B. 1 (b) is protected and used for the calculations explained in Section 3.1.5 (Figure 3.1).\\nThe Arena simulation model reads the data from this tab. Figure B.1 (c) shows how to select and\\nsetup the file InputDataFile.xls in Arena.\\n0 c -(D \\nwlwI\\nE \\nC\\nl \\n9k \\nkitak\\n4-J\\nQoga \\na\\nZt \\nC \\nL\\nL) \\nL\\n1~0 \\nOL \\nassasasass\\n&\\n \\n~\\nc\\n \\n4-$$2ttg \\na\\n111;1 \\n-\\na\\nw\\n \\n2-\\no)go\\n(U\\n4-j\\nL\\ni\\nII\\nx\\n94-\\nn\\nL\\ni\\nr4 \\nC\\nm\\n, \\nm\\n'D\\nr \\no\\n94\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n \\n.\\n.\\n \\n.\\n.\\n \\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nB.2.2 Replication Parameters for Arena Simulation\\nAfter preparing the Excel file with input parameters as mentioned Section B.2. 1, the user also\\nneeds to setup the replication parameters for the simulation model. Figure B.2 shows the\\nscreenshot from Arena where the user needs to specify these parameters.\\nHi dtVie* T0,04 AmW~~ Otec (E Wmndoa H*\\nI\\nRun Setup\\nRun Speed I fComoI Pepos\\nPNed Pmwnts Repleabon Pawame ma sues\\nSat Dae and Tune\\naJuay -2-10 12 0000 AM\\nWamvp Ped Tune Unha\\nRepheabon Length Tine Unbs\\n1395 Days\\nHours Per Day Base Tune un\\n24 Htours\\nTemwaWag Cadiond\\nFigure B.2: Setting the Replication Parameters\\nWe explain the key parameters shown in Figure B.2 as below.\\nI. Number ofReplications: This indicates the number of independent iterations or\\nreplications the simulation model is required to perform before producing final set of\\nresults. We recommend 20 replications to capture the variability in the system and\\nproduce reliable results. This means that the simulation model will run twenty times with\\n95\\n.............. ....... . . .. .\\n.................. . -\\na different set of random data every time and at the end of 2 0 th replication it will produce\\nthe results for user-specified output variables.\\nII. Start Date and Time: This indicates the beginning date and time for the simulation run.\\nFor example, if we want to conduct the simulation for 365 days in future, the Start Date\\nand Time indicates the very first day on which the simulation begins.\\nIII. Warm-up Period: In general, for simulating the situations that do not start without\\ninventory or material in process, the user needs specify warm-up period. For the\\nsimulation model discussed in this thesis, we recommend 30 days of warm-up, which we\\ndetermined through tests. This means that the statistics collected over first 30 days will\\nnot be counted towards final performance measures reported at the end of simulation\\nruns. In other words, the simulation model requires 30 days to stabilize the system and\\nstart performing close to the average conditions of the system that match with reality.\\nIV. Replication Length: This indicates the duration for which user would like to conduct the\\nsimulation. For example, we wanted to collect data from the simulation for 1 year.\\nGiven that we had 30 days of warm-up, the replication length was set to 395 days. The\\nuser needs to account for the warm-up period while setting the replication length.\\nB.3 Running the Model\\nAfter successfully completing the process in Sections B.l and B.2, the user can proceed to\\nrunning the model.\\nB.3.1 Running the Model in Arena\\nThe user should first check the model for any errors as a routine procedure. If no changes are\\nbeing made to the model and procedure mentioned above is correctly followed by the user, there\\nshould be no errors. Figure B.3 shows how to check the model for errors in Arena. The user\\n96\\nshould get the message No errors or warnings in model as shown below. If there are any errors,\\nthe user should review those errors and resolve them before running the simulation model.\\nfie Edt Vitw Tools Anange Object Widow Help\\n17 c~ O9fl> A 4-01- Go FS _______________\\nstep F10 Arena\\no Basic Process Fast-orward\\no Advanced Process\\nStat over Shft-FS No errors or warnings in model\\nDel.y Oipof\\nCheck Model F4\\nLu l]Revmw Erroft ORun ContobEIZ i\\nHold Moth U MAN__________ ________\\nFigure B.3: Checking the Arena Model for Errors\\nNext, the simulation run can be started by the user just by selecting option GO in from\\nthe drop-down Run menu as shown in Figure B.3.

Figure B.6 and B.7 indicate how to collect statistics for already-existing\\nvariables in the model and the custom variables defined by the user for the purpose of this model.\\nFor most of the variables in this model, the statistics collection is turned on by selecting the\\nReport Statistics check-box for Variable under the Basic Processes panel as shown in the Figure\\nB.6. The user can see the complete list of variables in the model and select the statistics for\\nvariables that are of interest. Additionally, the user can specify new or custom variables that are\\nof interest under the Statistics option which is listed under the Advanced Process panel as shown\\nin Figure B.7.

We developed a program to export daily results for few output\\n100\\nco q>\\nvariables as shown in Figure B.10. The default export starts after warm-up period of 30 days,\\nbut the user can change it that if needed. For example, if the user is interested in reviewing the\\nIFR at the DC for each individual day simulated in Arena and for all twenty iterations, then the\\nExcel file OutputDataFile.xls will contain those results as shown in Figure B. 11. The user needs\\nto specify this filename in Arena as shown in Figure B. 1 (c). This makes the simulation\\nextremely slow; on our laptop computer, a simulation run takes 1 minute without this additional\\nexport versus 120 minutes with export. We do not recommend exporting these types of\\nadditional results unless it is extremely necessary for the purpose of analysis. Results reported in\\nArena's built-in reports are generally sufficient for the purpose of analysis.\\nFigure B.10: Additional Export Program\\nE\\n0 0 81 100\\n100 0 0 32 28 0 0 156 156 100 0\\n100 0 0 32 28 0 0 217 0 100 0\\n100 0 0 83 0 0 0 107 132 100 0\\n100 0 0 72 0 0 0 145 107 100 0\\n100 0 0 101 28 0 0 139 131 100 0\\n0 0 87 28 0 0 139 43 100 0\\n0 0 82 28 0 0 120 19 100 0\\n100 0 0 23 28 0 0 74 190 100 0\\n40 100 0 0 1 45 28 0 0 123 210 100 0\\n41 100 0 0 28 28 0 0 209 56 100 0\\n42 100 0 0 6 28 0 0 171 74 100 0\\n43 100 0 0 30 28 0 0 126 169 100 0\\n44 100 0 0 3 28 0 0 197 85 100 0\\n45 100 0 0 52 28 0 0 148 149 100 0\\n46\\n100 0 0 3 87 0 0 0 99 90 100 0\\nFigure B. 11: Additional Export File - OutputDataFile.xls\\n101\\nA a\\n32 1 31\\n33 1 32\\n34 1 33\\n35 1 34\\n36 - 35\\n37 36_\\n38 - 37\\n39 1 38\\n40 1 39\\n...............................................\\n%EMI OrCW QV RM01 F R\\\"i LOSSM .J -i RAW Orawrg Rem ROM\\ncog\\nI51\\nB.4 Sensitivity Testing Setup\\nWe discussed the details of the sensitivity analysis in Chapter 4.

INTRODUCTION According to information technology consulting corporations, Microsoft's Azure in cloud computing arises as a rapid increase in technology that many organizations are ready to assume to progress the efficiency of the companies [1]. Investment in current technologies, for instance, cloud figuring, is rapidly growing at eighteen percent annually. At the same time, it is estimated to reach at least eighty percent of information technology by 2025. The use of Microsoft Azure is evolving per year in various companies. The investigations indicate that seventy-two percent of the participating organizations had already substantially implemented cloud technologies, especially Microsoft Azure. At the same time, some organization is still piloting all project on their works and analyzing both benefits and challenges of the technology [2]. The application of Microsoft Azure in supply chain management and retail warehouse distribution have been performing in which it has led to a large-scale transformation in traditional warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management, leading such organizations to innovate more dynamic retail distribution.  The research indicated various activities that the Microsoft Azure providers incorporate, including forecasting, planning sourcing and procurement, spare parts maintenance, and logistics, considered the first move in the cloud [3]. Involving Microsoft Azure\\u2019s cloud-based technology in warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management has contributed many advantages such as simplified operations, capital investment, time visibility, and scalability. However, before applying veil computing technology in supply chain management and retail distribution, limitations and risks such as confidential material and weak data awareness should be considered. Many companies are utilizing cloud computing from the private to the public stage, enabling an organization to benefit from the competitive advantage of implementing cloud interaction. II. METHODOLOGY This research depends on secondary, for instance, reference materials, research papers, and conference proceedings, such as all forms of reliable statistics that determine this paper's determination [4]. Thus, this paper has an overview and a summary of the use of Microsoft Azure as cloud computing in supply chain organization and retail warehouse distribution and the relationship between the use of Microsoft Azure and supply chain performance. In addition to the case study, the researchers interviewed cloud providers on their views on supply chain International Journal of Smart Sensors and Ad Hoc Networks (IJSSAN), ISSN No. 2248\\u20109738 , Vol\\u20103, ISSUE\\u20104 20  transparency and its related risk in cloud computing [5-7]. From the analysis of participants' responses to the case study and interviews, their collected some transparency structures that could be useful in comparing cloud providers based on the data they published on their websites. The results discussion, conclusions, and recommendation. A. Cloud Computing When mentioning cloud computing, it is essential to indicate both software that cloud benefactors can give to their customers and hardware. Cloud computing is an information technology service model that can provide computing services either by hardware or software and deliver information on demand to customers independently [8]. Customers can access cloud-based applications via web browsers, whereas data and software are kept in the servers' locations. Cloud figuring can be characterized into four types: isolated cloud totaling, open cloud computing, hybrid cloud totaling, and community [9]. The advantage of public computing against supply chain management is that organizations are not concerned about system maintenance or construction.  Fig 1: Warehouse Management System with Cloud  Public cloud computing in the distribution of retail warehouses is designed for open usage by the public. Public cloud computing can be operated and managed by companies and several partners; public cloud exists outside of the locations of the cloud providers. Using public cloud computing, users can achieve a cheaper setup application since third-party providers cover the cost [10]. While private cloud computing is on the premises of the cloud arrangement where operators of diverse business components retrieve it within the institute, the importance of using private cloud computing to develop privacy from the internal computing sources operating within the company [11]. Therefore, the need for higher security levels and lower risk has been perfect since it limits the number of users. Several customers have preferred private cloud computing over public cloud computing because of its flexibility and security.  Hybrid cloud computing is the grouping of public cloud and isolated cloud. In a hybrid cloud, there is two different cloud structure, whereas the remaining exclusive units are combined by the consistent technology that permits application and data to be portable. In hybrid cloud computing, the organization can sustain its isolated cloud and scale out the public; if the local volume is well utilized or in-the-house arrangements cannot support the workload, then an external system can provide alternative support [12]. Hybrid cloud figuring can stabilize the risks and benefits between public and private cloud computing and manage the cost of infrastructure in supply chain organizations and retail warehouse distribution. Cloud computing is only designed for companies with common goals, such as security necessities and regulatory obedience [13]. Communal cloud computing can be accomplished by more or a single party of the community or a combination of both. Community cloud computing can be hosted either externally or internally.  Retailers can use Microsoft Azure to accept or recover any file planned for distribution with various entities, such as forms, pictures, and videotape, among other organizer kinds, or usage in a cloud presentation. Microsoft Azure packing can even accommodate the categories of facts usually defined as Big Data, like underdone data from systematic tools or records from attendants [14]. Even holdups from record attendants and other campaigns, as well as computer-generated challenging energies for extra to simulated apparatuses, can be positioned in splotch storing. Enables improved provision of a devolved industry traversing numerous places can transfer International Journal of Smart Sensors and Ad Hoc Networks (IJSSAN), ISSN No. 2248\\u20109738 , Vol\\u20103, ISSUE\\u20104 21  information technology economics from conservation to allow for novelty. A solitary combined suite, eliminating the necessity to mix different schemes, enables improved teamwork with dealers, consumers, and networks. The use of Microsoft Azure in warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management consists of three unlike prototypes, which include organization as a provision, software as an amenity, and stage as services in which each of sieving various requirements of the Microsoft users. B. Improved Data Security in the Warehouse The Retailers obtain a nonstop flow of clients each time, and statistics are produced continuously. Cloud figuring is vibrant to accomplish such a massive volume of facts made by transactions, standard facts, and so on [10]. Furthermore, such business-delicate information must be cautiously controlled. A critical reason for corporate disappointment is the cost of private corporate statistics, individually recognizable information via system penetration, outbreaks of the most mutual attacks on supercomputers and the system/attendant, and ransomware contaminating structures and negotiations statistics.Information safety is a single significant issue to be talked about. Some retailers uphold their transactions facts, account intelligence, and purchaser response, among others, on the resident attendants [15]. While it is suggested that keeping facts on the cloud helps protect the information through advanced firewalls, encryption, occasion classification, internal firewalls, and external security. C. Improved Buyer Experience In the logistics world, the Vendors only partially use the client and transaction information that they gather. The cloud amenities supplier uses dynamic computing capitals and arithmetical representations to examine facts [16]. With its massive file, vendors can influence the points from the linked strategies to explore the ordering conduct, styles, and connections with theproduct to advance a reasonable superiority in policymaking. Utilizing client information analytics aimed at analytical acquisitions, retailers can forecast their clients' purchasing performance and what goods they purchase each time. If they buy reduced produces, what is the variety of the products they purchase? These figures are kept on the cloud, and by consuming analytics, merchants grow their promotion or selling approaches to appeal to additional consumers [17]. The practice of statistics analytics has increased, with the cloud being safe, dependable, and inexpensive for information storage and dispensation. Infrastructure as a service administration through cloud computing presented essential changes in cooperative relations, beliefs, and message positions. The consequences presented extraordinary results for huge administrations using cloud figuring amid harmonious concerns and interpersonal results [18]. Logistics directors from great establishments supposed that administrations utilizing cloud computing produced higher interpersonal results. Infrastructure as a provision is a platform where businesses can display their products in the method of attendants, storing, universe, and hardware at remuneration per usage provision. These services are ideal the Microsoft azure suppliers them in the paper of a virtual machine to raw storage or physical firewalls, networks, and load balances [19]. Many users buy these models as outsourced services instead of software and networking equipment servers to monitor the organization. A perfect example is amazon cloud AWS and Microsoft Azure. D. Platform as a service Microsoft Azure provides a host for computing settings, typically operating system programming language and database, where the users deploy and develop the application. Customers can lease virtual attendants to create and organize the current application. In some circumstances, the storage and figure properties are gauged routinely to acquire presentation requests. For instance, cloud customers do not have to distribute resources physically [20]. Software as service(SaaS) mode cloud providers operate and install presentation software in the mist, and customers use the software on many customers' tools via the thin client interface. For instance, program interface and computing resources are accessed by various customers using one of the models. Technology, cloud figuring is typical for allowing universal, practical, on-request system admission to a public pond of configurable adding International Journal of Smart Sensors and Ad Hoc Networks (IJSSAN), ISSN No. 2248\\u20109738 , Vol\\u20103, ISSUE\\u20104 22  assets submissions that can be quickly provided and unconstrained through negligible administration energy or amenity supplier interface. Prominently, it energetically poises to encounter the present request, whether the market outcomes from the performance of a supply-rigorous presentation by a sole operator or the unexpected arrival of numerous customers demanding entrance to a unified mutual source.  Fig 2: Software as a Service  Likewise, cloud assets can be free once request starts to reduce [21]. Taking a cloud organization implies that researchers should not concern with having or acquisition of the abilities to shape, achieve, and uphold a central and climbable situation. In its place, they can depend on unceasing contact with a data epicenter acquired by a third party. Instead of participating frankly to protect the essential hardware for an organization accomplished of supportive calculating science, investigators can, in its place, recompense for admission to the cloud totaling only as the necessity rises. Microsoft Azure's contact with massive ranges of achieved assets is an extra convincing cloud feature for scholars [22]. Cloud computing stages uphold the organization besides amenities on which claims are operated, such as functioning schemes and record facilities. Since all hardware is inattentive by the cloud podium, there is no addiction to any exact portion of hardware. So, sellers can relate covers and improve workings without unfavorably affecting management. III. CLOUD-INFLUENCE IN SUPPLY CHAIN ACTIVITIES The presentation of the Microsoft azure notion in supply sequence organization and retail warehouse distribution generates and innovates new fields that can be linked to two parties by delivering related information and cloud facilities. Planning and forecasting. Microsoft Azure platforms are helping an organization to advance their services by organizing the sequence associates. Such as supplier retailers and distributors, who play a vital role in demand forecasting. Microsoft azure gathers sales through the internet, performs simple analytics, and executes an accurate statistical demand forecast to various supply participants. The gathering of information through the internet leads to a significant decrease in the bullwhip effect in the supply chain [23], which contributes to the distortion of critical information in various stages of supply chain management. Therefore, enabling all the partners involved in supply to be conscious of the actual claim instability so that they can manage the situation. Microsoft Azure provides a solution for the order planning and demand combine and prediction implementation submissions to one solitary multi-party podium. The customer makes an order; supplies send the information to the public cloud making the data available simultaneously to all supply chains.  A. Sourcing and procurement  Sourcing includes receipt, attainment, and examination of received resources, identifying the obtaining process, and choosing suitable dealers. In this section, Microsoft, the azure platform, can operate a database with various suppliers' data. Microsoft Provides a significant boost for companies dealing with many supply materials. Organizations can choose their supplies depending on the appropriate materials provided according to time limits and specifications [24]. Cloud computing enables stores and organizations to develop contracts, mutually enlightening contract management. B. Logistics Microsoft Azure is useful for inventory, transportation, and warehouse management. The use of Microsoft Azure for logistics tracking various supply sequence associates. Procedures such as scheduling fleet management, command International Journal of Smart Sensors and Ad Hoc Networks (IJSSAN), ISSN No. 2248\\u20109738 , Vol\\u20103, ISSUE\\u20104 23  handling, conveyance course preparation, and worldwide compliance can be transferred to a cloud computing base[25]. A sole integrated cloud platform has more advantages to the transport sector because it limits pipeline inventory and the hand logistics sector [26]. Cloud services are essential for supply companies for itineraries. Cloud computing provides solutions to warehousing management due to many different customers at the same tie in one system.  C. Service and utility management Reverse logistics should be final in supply chain management; reverse logistics should be considered since it increases profits.   Microsoft Azure as cloud computing provides an opportunity for organizations to integrate advancing logistics (see Fig 3) through converse logistics in the warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management [27]. For instance, radio occurrence identification is an intelligence knowledge container used to pathway inventory location and later transmit information to the cloud application. Moreover, the inventory route can be observable to all supply chain management, from customers to manufacturers and vice versa. The returns processing, warranty proof, spare parts record, and technician report are the only progressions presented efficiently in a sole cloud-based stage.   Fig 3: Manufacturing Automation Flow  Many organizations reflect the manufacturing technique as their extensive supply chain stage. Cloud computing may be proven unsuitable for manufacturing because of its complex essential procedure that requires a high level of degree customization that the cloud-based cannot offer [28]. IV. CLOUD COMPUTING IN THIRD-PARTY LOGISTICS SERVICES After debating primarily about the potential for cloud-computing suggestions in supply chain organization and retail warehouse distribution, precisely the issues that technology contributes to companies. The reflectiveness of inventory and shipments either inside the company s boundaries among the source chain and retail warehouse stakeholders[29]. Cloud multiplying as a public, hybrid, or private cloud assembly can provide internal or external reflectiveness, which enhances with consequences and benefits as discussed below (Fig 4).   Fig 4: Extended Supply Chain in the Cloud era[29]  V. CLOUD MULTIPLYING ON SCM AND WAREHOUSE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION Changing an ancient source chain in an organization should determine the mechanical needs for shifting the source chain to the cloud and transforming the supply chain to Microsoft Azure, as cloud computing can be implemented by employing a cloud life cycle, a development lifecycle with numerous steps that make it possible for the transformation process to be evaluated and developed regularly. Nevertheless, before the transformational process, organizations should consider all the functional aspects that can make them create an overview of Microsoft Azure's execution in the supply chain management process[30]. Queries about the modifications, the advantages, and the challenges that are likely to be encountered when using Microsoft Azure should be considered before an organization takes any vital decision when moving to cloud computing. The subtopics below address the positive impacts of Microsoft Azure as cloud computing and the challenges likely to be International Journal of Smart Sensors and Ad Hoc Networks (IJSSAN), ISSN No. 2248\\u20109738 , Vol\\u20103, ISSUE\\u20104 24  encountered when employing cloud-based technologies.Further, the positive aspects of cloud adaption are defined below.  A. Cost Efficiency Microsoft Azure as a cloud computing system can be employed effectively because it has numerous financial advantages for organizations using the technology. Cloud facilities do not need any venture for software or device control possession. Thus, Microsoft Azure is more beneficial than regular in-house Enterprise Resource Planning structures provided by public clouds[31]. As a result, supply chain management capital cost can be shifted to operational expenditure, improving organizational cash flow. Thus, organizations must only pay activation and usage fees to install Microsoft Azure systems. This ensures that a company will save more resources by minimizing maintenance costs and ensuring minimal upgrade costs.   B. Simplification.  Microsoft Azure, as a cloud computing system, simplifies the organization. The system ensures that each part of the supply series is easily accessible via the same podium[32]. Moreover, the system eliminates compatibility issues to simplify the connection process and enhance information sharing among participants in a specific supply chain. Thus, the organization benefits from a collaborative community that improves security by allowing participants to set security[33]. The system minimizes the response time when making decisions between two or more participants. Cloud-founded services provide information regulation via one centralized storage structure to ensure a smooth flow of information in the supply chain.  C. Flexibility  The cloud computing system provides flexibility from demand projection to transportation or warehouse management. The demand prediction process, Warehouse, and transport management involve numerous applications in the supply chain, which can be boosted in one cloud-founded platform. Furthermore, Microsoft Azure ensures that participants can access such a stage from various organizational environments through a standard device despite the different geographical locations[34]. Management of Microsoft Azure is location-independent; hence can be accessed from other geographical areas. The extensive network availability alerts the entire supply chain, making the company swiftly enter a fresh market with new products and services.  D. Visibility Implementing Microsoft Azure in an organization offers timely linking with numerous supply chain partners. Thus, an organization can monitor the supply chain occurrences when they occur and deal with possible issues or deviations from the main goals [35]. Visibility is critical because it ensures that organizations can organize their activities and oversee various customers while providing the customer network has a clear view of the entire supply chain process. The organization also benefits from real-time inventory visibility to improve logistic trailing [36]. Microsoft Azure acts as a simulated warehouse for specific goods, such as those in the pipeline, enabling the firm to meet strategic order decisions. Moreover, it becomes easy for the organization to reroute the inventory as guided by the actual product location. VI. RISKAND LIMITATIONS Microsoft Azure, being a cloud-based technology, faces the problem of information safety and confidentiality. Data in the cloud should only be retrieved by accredited bodies such as trusted supply chain participants [37]. Nevertheless, cloud figuring structures as software items cannot continuously be responsible for discretion and privacy due to the rise in cyber security issues such as hacking[38]. Moreover, the advanced modern technology makes it possible for competitors to access crucial data from other organizations, threatening the entire supply chain process. A. Outdated Mindset Information and data distribution with public entities results in an immediate change in the ancient methods of thinking and working, which is vital in an organization's culture. Research shows that most organizations must disclose information concerning their production International Journal of Smart Sensors and Ad Hoc Networks (IJSSAN), ISSN No. 2248\\u20109738 , Vol\\u20103, ISSUE\\u20104 25  procedures or supply chain processes[39]. If competitors access such information, the organization can lose its competitive advantage. Implementing Microsoft Azure in supply chain management implies that a new change is introduced in the organization, which modifies the entire supply chain process[40]. Therefore, the organization must train its employees about the new technology to ensure a successful transition process. Thus, more adequate resources are needed to speed up the transition process.  B. Flexible Availability The users of Microsoft Azure as a cloud computing technology raises issues about the impacts of a possible crash down due to the user system's workload, which will interfere with the entire supply chain process. Such cases can be fatal to the organization resulting in a massive loss due to any delays caused by the malfunction[41, 42]. Additionally, the system can be negatively affected by poor network connectivity in different geographical locations leading to inconveniences in the supply chain process. C. Customization Free Solutioning Cloud computing technology cannot be easily customized according to the needs of the supply chain process since it usually provides a standardized service. Therefore, it may be difficult for the organization to solve specific supply chain errors [43]. For instance, since the production process is a composite primary process in the supply chain process with numerous customized methods depending on the product type, there should be a high level of cloud computing customization to make the process effective[44]. Thus, the absence of specialization lowers the market response and can negatively affect the company's competitive advantage. VII. CLOUD TYPES A. Private Cloud The private cloud provides computing resources distributed among various business units controlled by a single infrastructure. Introducing FedEx in private companies lets an organization emphasize client connection and get one border for many transaction procedures [45]. Before the introduction of private cloud technology, companies encountered many difficulties regarding massive collections of information, which requires a lot of computing control to analyze. However, when cloud computing was deployed, it reduced time wastage by about sixty percent and provided a parallel execution of batch processes. FedEx controls the company's activities all over the sphere by enabling global demand to deliver position and worldwide list visibility [46]. The hybrid cloud in this sector allows for the company's sales team an exclusive feature of a mobile solution that increases the effectiveness and improves the service of the company and the customer.  B. Public Cloud More than the private cloud is needed to accommodate many customers and partners; this problem encourages the introduction of the public cloud. Concerning supply chain tracking, some traditional organizations use phone calls and emails to collect the required data, which does not offer timely visibility. It suffers a big blow connecting all stakeholders (Banerjee, 2018). Contrary to the introduction of cloud-based public platforms contributes to capable connection to all customers and supply chains (Khodyakov et al.,.2018). Shifting to the free cloud suggests crucial monetary welfare for companies since it reduces the cost due to the nonexistence of possession cost of services providers. The most significant advantage of a public cloud platform is that its delivered information on the timely fulfillment of orders to customers and the minimum price. A natural disaster can reduce the rate of transportation schedules for many companies; therefore, cloud technology provides a solution to such obstacles [46, 47]. Shifting companies to the public cloud offer logistics management services to their customers, subsidiaries, and distributors. Cloud figuring allows minor companies to portion the same amenities as more prominent o organizations. For instance, the paybacks of flexibly interrelating and achieving procedures external to the association reduce the cost of ownership of supply series partnerships. Cloud computing needs the arbitrating support of supply sequence addition to achieve predictable achievement. Nevertheless, there is no final sign that cloud figuring has an inspiring result on either supply chain incorporation or operating presentation [48]. A significant positive connection was established International Journal of Smart Sensors and Ad Hoc Networks (IJSSAN), ISSN No. 2248\\u20109738 , Vol\\u20103, ISSUE\\u20104 26  between supply sequence addition and functioning presentation in all symbols used. VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS Microsoft Azure makes warehouse and supply chain management greener and neater[49].Cloud computing can be practical in supply chain organizations and retail distribution to facilitate stakeholder collaboration. Forecasting on the cloud limits distortion of the demand of the actual customers. Cloud computing is a relatively vast supply chain management. Many Microsoft Azure implementations in warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management have yet to be fully discovered. Business email compromises were the second most shared form of social engineering. The mainstream of social business incidents was found externally. Suppliers are subjugating older strengths that have yet to be patched. The organization offers real-time visibility via shipment across the supply chain management and retail warehouse distribution. IX. CONCLUSIONS Adopting enabling technology, supply chain management, and retail warehouse distribution should deploy a strong network that can improve the efficiency of the operation. Moreover, providing automated pick lists with coordinated devices and mobile to help reduce waste and eliminate mistakes. The organization of the workstation increases productivity since the workers have everything in one place. Workstations should be deployed all techniques and designs to reduce errors, keep carriers at bay, and improve safety. Supply chain management and retail warehouse distribution should optimize labor efficiency to generate effective picking plans and provide a high-volume ratio for the organization. The companies should streamline operations. To optimize and maximize all available space, companies should include taller storage units that can accommodate many goods and use standardized bins to improve the neatness and orderly of the shelves. The organization should adopt lean inventory to increase stock safety and allow suppliers to use larger quantities more often.

Keywords \\u2013 Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM), Green Logistics, Food Retail, Waste Management.    I. INTRODUCTION  The overall growing concern over environmental issues had further emphasized on the importance of incorporating green and sustainable practice in the supply chain management. Having this new concept, GSCM encourages production of more green products alongside improving the integration of suppliers with environmental issues [2, 3]. Over the years, the study of GSCM had often explored in the industrial sector and hardly in other sectors such as the food retail industry. In recent years, researchers had started to focus on adopting green and environment friendly concepts in the service industry rather than manufacturing industry [4]. Therefore, research relating to GSCM, and food retail industry began to surface. Earlier research highlighted that there is growing interest on the relation between GSCM and food retail industry because food and beverage industry act as a primary industry that is most suitable to mitigate environmental impacts [5].    II. LITERATURE REVIEW  The main purpose of conducting this literature studies is to examine the important observed research to identify various aspects of green supply chain management. Secondly, the studies also aim to determine the practices and methods adopted by manufactures and good retail sectors. Retailers are responsible for all supply chain processes [6]. The link between in-store activities and logistics had been identified by [7] as a major aspect to research on retailing. This finding was later affirmed by [8] through a list of sustainable retailing measures. It was then detected that the measures focus on energy, water, and waste management. Some retailers do not pay serious attention on the importance of water and energy management and the impact to the environment. However, water management is important in food retail stores especially in the areas where hygiene standards are prioritized. Besides water, energy management is also one of the important in-store processes that associates with keeping the environment green. In food retail industries, energy management play an important role when it comes to temperature regulating for food products such as chilled and frozen food. Another study [9] had further confirmed that the key drivers of carbon dioxide gas emission in Malaysia are economic growth and energy consumption [9]. As the industrial sector contributes to the Malaysia\\u2019s economic growth, research suggested that it was not likely to reduce energy consumption as doing so may affect the economic growth to dwindle as well. The researchers suggested that energy saving methods should be emphasize and policy makers could look on other alternatives such as investing in exploratory of the renewable energy sources [9].   In Malaysia, according to Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Corporation), there are approximately 16,650 tons of food waste dumped daily in landfills. In fact, the amount of food waste tends to increase by 15-20% more especially during festive seasons [10]. This food waste disposal method is beginning to raise concern of the authorities because the improper food waste management will create negative impact to the environment as greenhouse gas emission is increased due to high amount of methane and carbon dioxide produced because of natural decomposition process [11]. To tackle the issue of excess food waste, the Standard and Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM) had come up with some projects with the effort of converting these food waste to generate sources of energy. Besides, food waste could also be transformed into useful organic fertilizer to combat food waste issue. However, efforts from the government and NGOs will not be enough. The society should play their part and be aware of the importance of food waste management for the betterment of the environment and future generations [12].

Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) The public has become more aware about environmental issues happening worldwide in recent years and have directed the focus onto GSCM by integrating green concepts and practices into the traditional supply chain management. The main reason that drives the greening of supply chain in organisations is to address the environmental burden caused by the industry and its operations [13]. For efforts of greening the supply chain to be effective, it also depends greatly on the organization nature. There are various green supply chain practices that were identified and followed in practice in the manufacturing industries. This study intends to focus more on GSCM practice in terms of cooperation with customers, green purchasing and eco design.  Customer cooperation in supply chain is the extent where two parties collaborate with a mutual goal to achieve sustainable outcomes [14]. In fact, customer pressure would exist within this collaboration and play a role in influencing the organisation in adopting GSCM [15]. Developing a close cooperation with customers is encouraged as this collaboration could enhance and strengthen green innovations in supply chains. This approach would create a win-win opportunity to meet customer demand and improve sustainability effectively. Besides that, new green innovations would surely assist firms to stay competitive in the market among their competitors [16]. The cooperation with customers would also be able to contribute positively to the food retail industry as interactions with customer is crucial in the aspect of setting environment goals and plan together with efforts of reducing environmental impact. According to studies [17], there will be a direct involvement of organisation with its customers for environmental collaboration and this will bring about joint development of environmental solutions.  Green purchasing is one of the preliminary steps in addressing global environmental concern because the basics of purchasing is about acquiring the correct materials in the correct quantity or quality and at the correct time and place [18]. More specifically, green purchasing is simply acquiring environment-friendly or green products or services [19].  Nowadays, green purchasing appears to be an important component of environmental and supply chain strategies. Due to consumers\\u2019 rising concerns over the environment, purchasing companies had stressed on the role of purchasing functions in improving the environmental performance by integrating environmental aspects into business and organisational dimensions in making purchasing decisions. To ensure that purchases are green and benefits the environment, the practice of green purchasing is already introduced and implemented in the industries. Green purchasing creates awareness in purchasing activities by considering waste reduction and at the same time encouraging the effort of recycling and reusing certain materials [20]. The green products approach is still relatively new in Malaysia [21]. There is limited research available for reference which relates to green consumer products. Therefore, it is worthwhile exploring green purchasing especially in food retail industry, in terms of waste reduction and purchasing of eco-friendly machineries and materials for food production processes with the aim to control the number of toxic gases being released into the environment.   The eco concept in manufacturing a product considers the aim to reduce a product\\u2019s environmental effects throughout the entire life cycle [21]. It is close to impossible to design a product which does not have any impact at all to the environment, but at least, with this strategy, the eco-design approach would contribute to achieving a more sustainable future [13]. In recent years, companies are already seriously looking into producing eco-designed products to maintain competitiveness in the market, based on consumers\\u2019 changing perceptions, needs and preferences. Furthermore, the concept of eco-design also serves as a great opportunity for companies to achieve their goal of replacing harmful and hazardous materials used with materials that are more environment friendly. In the food retail industry, the GSCM eco design practice plays an important role especially in the production of eco products or packaging which have the reusable and recyclable attributes. In a review [18], researchers highlighted that the adoption of eco-design practice had significantly reduced the negative impact on the environment thus improving the company\\u2019s ability to contribute towards sustainability. Engaging suppliers in collaborative programs on eco products designing can sometimes lead to introduction of new innovative ideas pertaining to environmental technologies and materials.   B. Performance Outcomes In the present, the attention is now churned towards balancing between business and environmental challenges and requirements. There has been on-going research that discover and explore the impact of GSCM on performance outcomes which interlinks environment and economic performances [22, 20]. However, the interlink study of GSCM on environment together with social performances are rarely found in the industries. Therefore, this study will focus on discovering the impact of GSCM on both environment and social performances in food retail industry.  Environment performance can be evaluated based on a company\\u2019s resources consumed, regulation compliance level, processes, products, and services towards the environment [23]. The environmental performance can be measured in terms of reduction of poisonous gas emission, solid wastes and hazardous material consumptions created by activities in the supply chain network. As there seem to be a significant connection between environmental performance with supply chain management. The implementation of GSCM will improve the environmental performance for both the firm itself and to the suppliers or customers that conform to Proceeding Book of The 6th ICMEM 2021, 11-13 August 2021, Bandung, Indonesia ISBN: 978-623-92201-2-9   \\u00a9 2021  The 6th International Conference on Management in Emerging Markets (ICMEM 2021)  environmental regulations [24]. As there is demand for environmental performance, firms had to evaluate their performances by taking the initiative to improve on their capabilities in this aspect. Other studies mentioned that there could be positive effects on environmental performance should companies focus more on both corporate environmental management and GSCM [23]. To enhance environmental performance, [25] suggested that companies should engage in environmental collaborations and monitoring with the suppliers and customers at the supply chain level. Therefore, this study investigates whether there will be a similar positive impact of GSCM on environmental performance specific to food retail industry.  Social performance in general can be perceived as a measure of social related issues that brings about the attention of the society [26]. There are various social related concerns that a firm should consider along with the implementation of GSCM practices. According to [27], even though social performance is recognised for its importance, however, studies on this aspect is rarely found with the reason being that it can be quite a challenge to measure this performance based on social indicators. Social issues found in supply chain was defined by [28] as the effect of product or process-related aspects of operation on human safety, welfare, and community development. As there could be other metrics of measures possibly available for evaluating social performance, the metrics could be identified and selected by different dimensions [29]. Due to the limited number of studies available for reference, the impact of GSCM on social performance is yet to be assessed in this study that focus on food retail industry and the findings will be reported accordingly.  III. PROPOSED RESEARCH FRAMEWORK  For many years, there are many studies carried out that highlights the importance of the relationships among experiences, the green supply chain management practices, and firm\\u2019s performances [30, 31]. Only a few similar works were done in the context of food retail industry [20, 32]. However, detailed analysis was carried out on different sets of relationship between the individual antecedents with individual GSCM practice and, individual GSCM practice with individual variables of performance outcomes. This research studies provide the importance of various attributes of green supply chain management practices and the performance variables. Hence, the study intends to contribute to a continuation of the previous research results and step up to the next level by identifying and verifying the relationship and impact of GSCM on other performance outcomes, in this case is environmental and social performances. The core of this study can be represented with a simple conceptual framework to connect the variables of interest. In this case, the backgrounds here are the in-store logistics referring to environmental and waste management. These two backgrounds encourage further implementation of GSCM practices which are cooperation with customers, green purchasing and eco-design that forms the central structure of the framework. The final part of the study will relate to the performance outcomes, environmental and social performance. There are multiple individual relationships to be investigated and each one is represented as an individual hypothesis. The in-store logistic measures are assumed to directly drive the practice of GSCM thus forming the hypothesis to be explore in future research. The conceptual framework summarised by the individual relationships of study indicated by the arrows connecting the variables.   Fig. 1.  Research Conceptual Framework  \\uf0a7 H1a \\u2013 Water and energy management positively affects cooperation of customers. \\uf0a7 H1b \\u2013 Water and energy management positively affects green purchasing. \\uf0a7 H1c \\u2013 Water and energy management positively affects eco-design.  \\uf0a7 H2a \\u2013 Waste management positively affects cooperation of customers. \\uf0a7 H2b \\u2013 Waste management positively affects green purchasing. \\uf0a7 H2c \\u2013 Waste management positively affects eco-design.    The above connection formed between in-store logistics and GSCM practices are further extended to link the relationship with the environmental and social performance of the firm. It is believed that the cooperation of customers, green purchasing and eco-design should lead to improving the environmental and social performances. Thus, the formulation of the remaining hypotheses as:  \\uf0a7 H3a \\u2013 Cooperation with customers positively affects the environmental performance. \\uf0a7 H3b \\u2013 Cooperation with customers positively affects the social performance. \\uf0a7 H4a \\u2013 Green purchasing positively affects the environmental performance. \\uf0a7 H4b \\u2013 Green purchasing positively affects the social performance.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH  With the limited number of earlier studies found studying green supply chain management (GSCM) within food retail industry, a preliminary conclusion can be drawn that even though GSCM is widely known and implemented in companies, it could rarely be taken for the food retail industry. The in-store logistics that are potential impacts on GSCM practices were identified and justified the importance of implementing GSCM practices in business and organisational operations. However, there are various GSCM practices that a company can adopt depending on their organizational needs, business functions and nature. In this study, three GSCM practices such as cooperation with customers, green purchasing and eco-design are chosen as the focus due to these variables are important components to be concerned of in the company when incorporating green concept in the organisation. Past research revealed that GSCM practices tend to affect environmental performance in the industries. However, limited evidence was found relating to social performance as not many studies were done in the aspect. Therefore, in food retail industry, the findings obtained at the end of this study shall be able to provide a better picture whether GSCM practices are able to contribute on improving company\\u2019s performance outcomes.  This research focuses on food retail industries in Malaysia. However, the area of study in Malaysia itself is too wide. Being a country comprising of 14 states, the area of study for this research has been narrowed down and Penang is selected as the prime location for data collection. Penang is well-known for being the food capital of Malaysia, thus food retail industry tends to occupy a relatively big market. In fact, Penang was also previously reported as one of the top three states with the highest retail sub-sector occupancy. There are several studies that explored the concepts of GSCM, including its implications and applications. In Malaysia, studies related to GSCM in food retail industry is indeed very rare. This research, in trying to establish the association between green in-store logistics and food retail industry performance outcome due to the implementation of green supply chain management, produces the results that should contribute to enhancing the management focus on adopting green concepts and cultures in supply chain management of food retail industry. The study aimed to identify various aspects of green supply chain management practices through comprehensive review of literature based on the outcomes of various studies carried out within the context of food retail and food manufacturing environments. Through our study it was noted that many researchers have proposed different framework based on the specific criteria and attributes within their context, and one which can be taken as the basis of future work for our research studies. One of the other aspects for future research could also examine the managerial and strategic implications on the adoption of GSCM practices within food retail sector. It should aim to inform and provide key decision makers, including management on any patters of observations and practices to be adopted by retailers. Businesses could be able to explore any drivers and barriers towards adoption of these methods and frameworks to enable them towards their future retail practices and user experiences towards green practices. Finally, like any research or conceptual studies, our study also has few limitations. Although, our study adopted a systematic approach towards researching the existing knowledge and articles, the authors do envisage some gaps that could be further explored by future research studies. For example, a social dimension study on the impact and behaviours of individuals and users from different cultural, social and usage backgrounds can be explored in future. Similarly, demographic, and behavioral studies may also be explored as a dimension in the future. Future researchers and studies are encouraged to focus on both conceptual and empirical studies to further examine and evaluate the concepts of green supply chain management practices.

      "        \"abstract\": \"Supply chain management coordinates the production and distribution of a product with the goal of increasing profitability and productivity. Advancements in technology and workflows in recent years have enabled distributors, suppliers, and retailers to operate more efficiently and effectively. Although significant technological advancements have been made in supply chain management, inventory management still causes a number of problems for retailers. The average out-of -stock rate nationally is approximately at an 8% level (Corsten & Gruen, 2003). Inadequate inventory management can reduce retail sales, drive up costs associated with transportation and storage, decrease customer loyalty, and ultimately lead to a significant loss in revenue for the retailer.

Advancements in technology and \\nworkflows in recent years have enabled distributors, suppliers, and retailers to operate more \\nefficiently and effectively.  Although significant technological advancements have been made in \\nsupply chain management, inventory management still causes a number of problems for retailers.  \\nThe average out-of -stock rate nationally is approximately at an 8% level (Corsten & Gruen, \\n2003).  Inadequate inventory management can reduce retail sales, drive up costs associated with \\ntransportation and storage, decrease customer loyalty, and ultimately lead to a significant loss in \\nrevenue for the retailer.   \\nRFID is an emerging technology that has recently begun to emerge as a tool to improve \\nsupply chain management and logistics in the consumer packaged goods industry.  While the \\ntechnology has met resistance in its implementation, its benefits still show promise in its ability \\nto improve communication and workflows.    \\nThe purpose of this study is to establish the need for increased information system \\ntechnology in the purchasing, merchandising, and distribution practices which are currently \\nbeing utilized by retailers and mass merchandisers.  This study will analyze current distribution \\nand supply chain frameworks and determine the most efficient and cost effective measures that \\norganizations can implement to the supply chain and determine if technology such as RFID can \\nbe more efficient and produce an acceptable return on investment.   \\n \\n iv \\n \\nAcknowledgements \\n \\nI would like to acknowledge my family for their support and encouragement.

Supply chain \\nmanagement plays an integral part in improving the effectiveness which organizations \\nmanufacture and deliver products to business partners and consumers.  The ultimate goal \\nof effective supply chain management is to provide the consumer with the product that \\nthey want, when they want it, and at a competitive delivered price.    \\nThere are numerous tools and processes utilized by retailers in supply chain \\nmanagement including Universal Product Code (UPC), Vendor Managed Inventory \\n(VMI), and Handheld devices (Smart handheld).    \\nThe most common tool of a replenishment system is the Universal Product Code \\nor UPC.  UPC provides a standardized method for identifying products and product \\ndescription.  They allow retailers to keep track of products that the retailer receives and \\nsells.  UPC helps improve on-hand quantities and track products moving in and out of the \\nstore.   \\nMany retailers have also utilized additional inventory mechanisms, including \\nVendor Managed Inventory, or VMI.  VMI is the process where the vendor manages the \\ninventory and replenishment of the retailer\\u2019s inventory.  VMI was designed to improve \\nthe product flow between the vendor and retailer.  Some retailers also incorporate a \\nhandheld device, these are portable computers and order transmission devices.  Handheld \\ndevices allow stores to manually update inventory levels and order product.  \\n \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n2 \\nRecently, more advanced technology has emerged in the consumer packaged \\ngoods industry. An example of this is Radio-frequency Identification (RFID), which \\nallows a product to be tracked by radio frequency.  Starting in June 2003, the Wal-Mart \\ncompany requested that its top 100 suppliers place RFID tags on pallets and cases that \\nwere shipped to stores in Dallas, Texas.  Many retailers such as Target, Best Buy, and \\nAlbertson\\u2019s followed suit, and many manufacturers began to implement the technology \\nwithin their products (Read, 2004). \\nRFID technology has the potential to revolutionize the consumer product \\nindustry, but also contains monumental obstacles that need to be overcome to realize its \\nfull potential.  While RFID promises new and efficient ways to distribute and control \\nproducts within the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry, there remain a number \\nof questions that must be resolved before the technology is completely adopted by the \\nindustry.  RFID must present an accepted ROI formula that proves that it is accepted by \\nall levels in the supply chain.  ROI formulas vary by company, but normal business \\npractices call for any capital expenditures to either maintain or improve the company\\u2019s \\nreturn on investment goals.  Simply stated, corporations are keenly aware of how Wall \\nStreet evaluates their expenditures for any asset, including technology.  Usually the \\nhigher and faster the return on investment equates to higher stock ratings and the \\nresulting higher stock valuation.  Privately held companies might be judged to be worth \\nmore in the event they were to be sold.  The issues with RFID are further complicated by \\nthe return rate which can vary by market segment; a manufactures ROI requirement may \\nbe different than a distributors or retailer due to industry standards and competition.  \\n\\u201cBest of class\\u201d always tends to set hurdle rates for each segment.  Additionally, all levels \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n3 \\nmust decide upon a common and efficient hardware configuration.   The data that is \\ncollected and assigned to products must also be managed and defined.  Current legacy \\nsystems must also be taken into account and the process of implementing the new \\ntechnology must be defined in a consistent framework.  Finally, RFID must create \\nstandards and concepts that can be applied throughout the business world including \\ninternational networks and supply chains (Poirier, 2006). \\nThis paper will look at the current state of RFID technology in the Consumer \\nPackaged Goods industry.  It will look the benefits and barriers to implementing the \\ntechnology across the industry.  The paper will conduct a study that will look at a major \\ndistributor in the consumer packaged goods industry, the McLane Company.  The current \\ndistribution model and technology used by the organization will be discussed and \\nanalyzed.  Fill rates and replenish processes using barcode technology will be discussed \\nto determine if a new technology such as RFID tags would improve fill rates, location, \\ntracking, and efficiency. The study will provide the industry insight into the benefits and \\nobstacles into implementing RFID across a large scale.  \\nListed below are the questions this thesis will address.  \\nResearch Questions \\n\\uf0b7 What is the current distribution model used by the McLane company? \\n\\uf0b7 What method is currently implemented for product and item location? \\n\\uf0b7 What are the results and fill rates of using a Vendor Managed Inventory VMI \\nsystem? \\n\\uf0b7 What is current process for replenishment to stores? \\n\\uf0b7 What are the current uses for Smart Handheld devices? \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n4 \\n\\uf0b7 How does RFID technology improve the distribution process and workflows? \\n\\uf0b7 What are the barriers to implementing an RFID system? \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n5 \\nChapter 2 \\u2013 Review of Literature and Research  \\nThe concept of Supply Chain Management (SCM) has been studied for decades.  \\nMoving products effectively from production to the end user has been studied and \\nanalyzed by manufactures, distributors and retailers, all attempting to improve the \\nprocess.  The term \\u201cSupply Chain Management\\u201d, became popular in the late 1980\\u2019s \\nwithin the business world.  is defined as \\u201cthe systemic, strategic coordination of the \\ntraditional business functions and the tactics across these business functions within a \\nparticular company and across businesses within the supply chain, for the purposes of \\nimproving the long-term performance of the individual companies and the supply chain \\nas a whole\\u201d (Metzer, 2001).   \\nThe supply chain is operated by a number of components and organizations.  Each \\ncomponent is responsible for different functions, with the end goal of delivering a final \\nproduct to the consumer effectively and at a low cost.  The companies that participate in \\nthe supply chain include producers, distributors, retailers, and the consumer.  Producers \\nare typically the manufactures of a product.  They make a product out of raw materials \\nand package the product for consumption.  Distributors are organizations that are the \\nmiddleman between the manufacturer and retailer.  A distributor will receive and store \\nproducts from a large number of manufacturers and will deliver or replenish the product \\nto retailers depending on the retailers need.  Retailers sell products directly to consumers.  \\nRetailers will advertise products and promotions to attract consumers to their stores.  \\nConsumers are the typically the end user of the product (Hugos, 2006). \\nThere are a number of factors that drive the supply chain.  These include \\nproduction, location, inventory, transportation, and information.  Production includes the \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n6 \\nactual manufacturing of a product, quantity produced, and balancing the production \\ncapabilities while still maintaining quality. Inventory management focuses on two \\nimportant aspects, customer service and cost control.  Inventory management helps \\ndecide how much inventory should be stocked during every stage of the supply chain.  \\nInventory can be costly to hold, but must also be readily available, therefore a balance of \\nlevels must be made to ensure the most optimum level.  Location in supply chain \\nmanagement determines the location of production and inventory.  Organizations must \\nensure that the location of the facilities provide efficient transportation for delivery to \\nretailers and consumers.  Transportation involves what method is utilized to move the \\nproduct through the supply chain (truck, train, aircraft, etc.).  Information is another \\nimportant aspect of supply chain management.  Data must be collected and shared to \\nensure proper management and logistics (Hugos, 2006). \\nIn order for supply chain management to work effectively, information must be \\ngathered and stored throughout the management chain lifecycle.  When large amounts of \\nproducts are produced and distributed throughout the supply chain, it is essential that \\nthese products can be identified effectively and efficiently.   In order to manage and \\nmaintain information and data, products are provided with an identification number or \\nproduct identification code.  This code can identify a product quickly and efficiently and \\nallows organizations to collect and share data (Hugos, 2006). \\nFor the past fifteen years the most popular product tracking standard has been the \\nUniversal Product Code or UPC.  The first bar code was introduced in 1952, by Joseph \\nWoodland and Bernard Silver.  The bar code was not used commercially until 1966.  \\nStarting in 1970 the first industry standard was introduced. It was called the Universal \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n7 \\nGrocery Product Identification code or UGPIC.  Three years later, the UGPIC became \\nwhat is now known as UPC.  The first product to be used at a retail store occurred on \\nJune, 26, 1974, when a 10-pack of Wrigley Juicy fruit gum was scanned using a hand \\nheld scanner at Marsch Supermarket in Troy, Ohio.  Since its original scanning in 1974 \\nUPC bar codes have been used to scan billions of products at retail stores (Albert, 2007). \\nThe introduction of UPC in the retail industry quickly transformed the way the \\nCPG and grocery industry managed their business.  Standards were created in UPC \\nbarcodes and the system grew into a global system called the GS1 System.  The GS1 \\nsystem is used by millions of companies in over 140 countries (Barcodes, 2010). \\nUPC product codes are created by a not-for-profit company called Uniform Code \\nCouncil, or UCC.  The organization develops worldwide standards for identification \\ncodes and electronic commerce.  A UPC barcode symbol includes a black and white bar \\ncode consisting of vertical black bars and white spaces in-between.  In addition to the \\nblack and white bar code, numbers are located at the bottom of each bar code symbol.  \\nThe distance between the vertical bars and the thickness of the black vertical bars \\ncontains the numbers in the barcode.  Each barcode contains two black bars that identify \\nthe beginning and the end of the bar code (Barcodes, 2010). \\nWhen an organization requests a product to be entered in the UPC system, the \\nUCC will issue the manufacturer a specific identification number.  The GS1 Company \\nprefix is a unique code that contains a numerical sequence of anywhere from seven to \\neleven numerical digits which then are licensed to the manufacturer for a single item.  A \\nLegal Entity GLN is also assigned to the manufacturer that identifies legal descriptions \\nand functions (Uniform Code Council, 2010). \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n8 \\nThe use of UPC codes actually began in the early 1970\\u2019s as a technological \\nsolution for large supermarkets trying to price goods. Supermarkets were spending \\nmillions of labor dollars annually, paying workers to work nights affixing adhesive type \\nlabels to every \\u201cstore keeping unit\\u201d or\\u201d SKU\\u201d which they stocked. Items that were \\nrefrigerated or frozen posed special problems for adhesive labels.  Night labor was paid a \\npremium shift differential and there was also a higher percentage of employee turnover; \\nthereby increasing hiring and training costs.  It was made even more difficult, as the \\npricing of many goods are driven by the constantly changing commodity markets, and \\nalso other factors such as; freight costs, labor strikes, weather, manufacturing \\npromotional activity, and competition Supermarket profits depend on their ability to \\nquickly raise prices on items that have gone up, thereby creating inventory profit gains. \\nThe reverse situation when prices fall also creates the need to maintain competitive \\npricing to protect market share.  Pricing integrity is an important factor for customer \\nretention. Sale or Promo items also drive price change needs. Wednesday became the \\nmain newspaper advertising day for supermarkets to run their weekly specials, so all \\npromo items had to be marked down on Tuesday night. Situations arose where the same \\nproduct in the same bin had more than one price, or there were numerous incidents where \\nthe new price label did not quite cover the old price, triggering the infamous public \\nannouncement, \\u201cPrice check in aisle 3 please\\u201d(Grogman, 2009).  \\nSupermarkets liked the premise that a unique numerical barcode would be made \\nfor every item produced and easily printed on the existing label or exterior packaging.  \\nThe UPC process, although tedious in start up, quickly gained a loyal following because \\nof the high return on the investment.  Like any major technological change it created new \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n9 \\nchallenges, the scanners were expensive and worked well when the UPC code was easily \\ndisplayed, but some items with reflective qualities such as water or clear juices reflected \\nback the scan resulting in a \\u201cno read\\u201d and slowed the checkers. Other times the scan bar \\nwas unable to read anything, as the enclosed glass screen was dirty, because of wet \\nproduce or leaking containers.  Training techniques for check-out personal had to be \\nincluded in the program. Other issues that challenged the program were items made \\noverseas that were not participating in the UPC program, these vendor partners had to \\nadhere to the standards or be culled from the SKU mix.  There were also items that had \\nthe UPC code but inside the carton there was more than one saleable unit. Many times \\nthese individual items did not have a UPC code, so someone buying one Snicker Bar, \\nmight inadvertently, pay for a box of 36.  These situations also led to overstock issues \\nwhen supermarkets started using UPC codes for replenishment, as sometimes there was \\nconfusion between eaches, boxes, and cases (Grogman, 2009). \\nThe success of UPC technology also accelerated the acceptance of the VMI \\nprocess which was mentioned earlier.  There had been a huge increase in the number of \\nproducts that were manufactured by one corporation, as well, as high volume SKU\\u2019s, \\nwhich represented high percentages of daily sales. Proctor and Gamble, as an example, \\nsupplies thousands of items in many categories to a supermarket. It has products in \\nalmost every aisle and might control 15% to 20% of the total items stocked.  This type of \\nmega-penetration leads to the mutual need of being \\u201cin-stock\\u201d and also being on the same \\npage when it comes to marketing and advertising. VMI insures that a supermarket chain \\nwill have the information to promote certain items at the same time the manufacturer is \\nusing a variety of media events to create demand. The price that is charged is always, by \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n10 \\nlaw, determined by the retailer. The supermarket or big box store must have a firm \\nwritten agreement in place which spells out measurable parameters that must be adhered \\nto. Main elements include; dollar inventory levels by day, week, and month, and cover \\nholiday and seasonal items. Inventory goals must also be negotiated to maximize \\ninventory turn to free up capital from slow moving inventory. The manufacturer also \\nbenefits by manufacturing on a \\u201cjust in time\\u201d atmosphere which \\u201cfrees up\\u201d its capital as \\nwell, and allows it to operate more efficiently. Shipping parameters must be decided to \\nmaximize both parties\\u2019 logistical needs and sometimes enables a retailer to fine or charge \\nback a vendor for failing to perform. Finally there needs to be a written description of \\nhow and when \\u201con-going dialogue\\u201d is to take place. A manufacturer always wants more \\nshelf space and more of its SKU's displayed, a retailer wants to stock what consumers \\nwant and also what produces the largest profit. VMI has evolved into a basic tenant of \\nsuccessful \\u201cmajor retail players\\u201d (Grogman, 2009). \\nWhile UPC has been used in the majority of CPG supply chain management \\nproduct coding, a new technology called Radio frequency identification or RFID has \\nrecently began to gain momentum.  The beginnings of RFID can be traced back to World \\nWar II.  The United Kingdom applied RFID type devices to identify airplanes returning \\nfrom a mission.  Previously, radar could only detect incoming aircraft, but not the country \\nof origin.  The application for using the technology began advancing in other industries \\nabout 30 years later.  The supply chain has been a particularly strong market for RFID \\nand its technology.  In 1974, a group of European organizations came together to develop \\na standard number system similar to the UPC standards that were established in the \\nUnited States.  The resulting organization became known as European Article Numbering \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n11 \\nInternational or EAN.   In 1999, steps were taken to form a global network that would \\nstandardize RFID in the supply chain.  The UCC and Procter and Gamble began funding \\nthe Auto-ID Center, which is based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in \\nCambridge Massachusetts.  The major goal of the Auto ID Center was to create \\ninexpensive RFID tags that could be used in consumer goods.    The tags would allow a \\nnetwork to collect and share information about products that had a RFID chip installed.  \\nThe Auto-ID Center plans to create a network that would become \\u201cAn Internet of \\nThings\\u201d: and allow the ability to share and locate items throughout the network.  The \\nAuto-ID center is comprised of 100 global companies and seven universities from around \\nthe world.  The center focuses on creating cost efficient standards, and future proofing the \\nEPC Network Infrastructure. This will allow the industry to grow and support future \\napplications and advancements in technology (Poirier & McCollum, 2006). \\nThe interest in RFID continued to develop in the CPG industry, Wal-Mart in 2003 \\nannounced new mandates for RFID implementations.  Wal-Mart required that its top 100 \\nsuppliers must apply RFID labels to all of its shipments.  Early adopters of RFID found it \\ndifficult to implement the system in their current legacy and supply chain management \\nsystems.  Many manufacturers implemented manual processes which made it difficult to \\nrealize a fair return on investment (Duvall, 2007). \\nRFID Operations and Functions \\nRFID provides a tagging system that allows an object to be tracked, located, and \\nidentified using wireless communication.  Information regarding a product or item is \\ncontained in small chips that are attached to a pallet, a shipping container, or the item \\nitself.  The information contained on the chip can be received by an RFID reader and \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n12 \\ninformation can be decoded and stored on servers.  The information is sent through a \\nradio frequency and the frequency contains the products\\u2019 electronic product code, or \\nEPC.  Information including the EPC is saved on the RFID chip; the chip has a miniature \\nantenna.  A numbering system identifies all items as unique.  When a reader scans a \\nRFID chip, the chip will return the items EPC. Information stored on the chip includes \\nthe code header, the EPC Manager Number, the Object Class, and the serial number.  The \\nheader contains the information regarding the type of EPC including the length and type.  \\nThe EPC manager number maintains and identifies the company or entity.  The object \\nclass shows the class of the item.  The object class is a similar practice to the SKU.  \\nFinally, the serial number identifies the instance of the object class (Poirier, 2006). \\nAn entire RFID system consists of an RFID tag, an antenna, a RFID reader, \\napplication software, and middleware.  The RFID tag can be either a read-only tag or a \\nread/write tag.  The tag broadcasts the information about the item to a reader that is \\nrequesting the item.  The antenna transmits and receives data through radio frequency.  \\nReaders send a signal to the RFID tag and receive a response.  The reader receives \\ncommands from the application software.  In addition, the reader can provide the RFID \\nchip with power when the RFID tag is a passive tag.  The application software can be \\nprogrammed to accommodate the functions of the user.  The middleware is used between \\nthe hardware and application software (Poirer, 2006). \\n RFID chips can be active or passive.  Passive chips have no internal power supply \\nand rely on the RFID reader to provide a small amount of power to active the chip.  \\nPassive tags are cheaper and smaller because of the lack of an internal power supply.  \\nActive chips contain an internal power source which allows the chip to transmit a \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n13 \\nstronger data signal over long ranges.  The chip can also contain a larger internal \\nmemory.  The internal memory and internal power source allows the tag to store data that \\nis sent from the receiver.  Active tags are larger than passive tags, but they are more \\npowerful and have the ability to write data, making the active tags more functional \\n(Myerson, 2007). \\nWhile there are no current universal standards in RFID technology, there has been \\na considerable amount of work done to develop standards for different applications.  An \\norganization called the International Organization for Standardizing or ISO created \\nstandards for tracking animals called ISO 11784.  Additionally, the ISO has created \\nstandards for payment systems and smart cards.  The Auto-ID center has been trying to \\ncreate low-cost RFID tags for supply chain management and CPG's.  The technology \\nthey began using was ultra-high frequency band or UHF.  The Auto Id center also \\ndeveloped a protocol and licensed it to the EPCgobal.  The protocol is made royalty-free \\nfor manufacturers and users.  The UHF protocol was originally designed to communicate \\nwith different classes as technology advanced.  Class 1 is a passive RFID tag that is read \\nonly.  Class 2 is a passive tag system that has 6KB of read and writes memory.  Class 3 is \\na semi-passive tag with a built in battery for increased readability.  Class 4 is an active \\ntag that has a built in battery and additionally transmits to a signal.  Class 5 is also an \\nactive tag that can only communicate with class 5 tags and devices.  Auto-ID gave its \\nclass 0 and class 1 protocol to the EPCglobal and the EPCglobal approved Class 0 and \\nClass 1 as EPC standards (Myerson, 2007). \\nClass 0 and Class 1 RIFD both possess downsides.  They do not work with one \\nanother and are also incompatible with the ISO standards.   Both classes also operate \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n14 \\nusing two different frequencies, one that is used to send and another to receive.  This \\nissue has caused problems in some countries where regulations prohibited their use.  A \\nnew protocol was introduced in 2004 that included a second generation of RFID tags.  \\nThe tags were developed to work within ISO standards, but were not compatible with \\nprevious generation 1 and 2 classes (Myerson, 2007). \\nRFID in Consumer Packaged Goods \\nUsing RFID in the CPG industry is a relatively new concept.  The idea took a \\nlarge leap when Wal-Mart, the world\\u2019s largest retailer, began to mandate that the supplier \\nbegin to use RFID and Electronic Product Codes to track pallets and cases.  Wal-Mart \\nmet with its top 100 suppliers and introduced the concept of RFID and requested that \\nsuppliers begin using the technology for distribution to its stores.  Their RFID strategy \\nwas announced in 2003, and top suppliers were mandated to tag all pallets by 2005. The \\ngoal included adding the next 100 suppliers to the mandate every year.  Wal-Mart \\nbelieved that a transition to RFID would improve efficiencies in logistics, improve out-\\nof-stocks, and improve sales (Supply Chain Digest, 2009).  \\nAlthough Wal-Mart gained support from some suppliers such as Proctor and \\nGamble and Unilever, many suppliers have been slow in achieving implementation.  \\nSeven years after Wal-Mart's initial mandate, only 600 of their 60,000 suppliers have \\nbeen able to adapt to the changes.  The ROI has been debated among suppliers. An \\naverage low cost RFID tag costs 10-15 cents. Compared to the standard bar code, this is \\nrelatively high, particularly among item level tagging. This makes it difficult for suppliers \\nto invest.  Wal-Mart is not the only retailer to have difficulty implementing an RFID \\nstrategy.  Retailers such as Albertsons, Best Buy and Target have all tried test pilots using \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n15 \\ntheir own RFID programs, but have scaled back implementation because of high costs \\nand other difficulties, similar to what Wal-Mart experienced (Duvall, 2007). \\nIn 2007, Wal-Mart scaled back its implementation of RFID.  Instead of having all \\npallets tagged with RFID, they focused on shipments to Sam\\u2019s Club (Wal-Mart\\u2019s \\nWholesale chain). They also focused on promotional displays and products in Wal-Mart \\nretail stores, and began to test the impact of the technology in improving category \\nmanagement in some departments (Supply Chain Digest, 2009).  \\nWal-Mart is still pushing forward with its mandate for suppliers to comply with its RFID \\nsystem.  Beginning in January of 2008, Wal-Mart charged suppliers with a $2.00 fee for \\nevery pallet that was not tagged with an RFID tag shipped to Sams Club (Weier, 2008). \\nThe charge covered the cost that Wal-Mart had to pay in order for the company to affix a \\ntag.  Additionally, Wal-Mart announced plans to implement pallet level tagging in 17 \\ndistribution centers by 2008, case and mix pallet tagging by 2009, and selling-unit \\ntagging in all distribution centers by October 2010 (Duvall, 2007). \\nBenefits of RFID in Consumer Packaged Goods \\nRFID technology has a number of benefits over the current barcode system which \\nis currently used in the CPG industry.  RFID technology has benefits that include reduced \\nwarehouse and distribution costs, reduced point of sale costs, increased inventory \\naccuracy, reduced theft, and reduction in out of stock items at retail.  RFID also provides \\nthe benefits of allowing a product or item to be tracked in a real time basis as it \\nprogresses through the supply chain.  Items can be tracked using an RFID reader, which \\neliminates the need to physically scan an item with a handheld scanner.  A RFID can also \\nscan multiple items at the same time, eliminating the need for a barcode scanner that \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n16 \\nscans items individually.  RFID tags can also hold and store much more information than \\na traditional barcode system.  Some RFID tags can read and write data allowing \\ninformation to be recorded, tracked, and changed through the supply chain (Poirier, \\n2006). \\nAccording to a survey by Aberdeen Group in 2007 the top objectives of RFID in \\nmanufacturing included asset tracking, production efficiency, supply chain visibility, raw \\nmaterials management, mandate compliance, and finished goods inventory control \\n(Zebra, 2007). \\nIn relation to retail stores, RFID technology can greatly reduce out of stock items \\nand provide better visibility of products within the store.  Out of stock items are still \\nmajor factors in the loss of sales at store level. Ensuring that an item is in stock and \\navailable to a retailers\\u2019 customer is extremely important to many organizations.  For \\nexample Wal-Mart currently has its store divided into multiple departments with each \\nmanaged by a department manager or zone manager.  Every day, Wal-Mart protocol \\nrequires their manager to scan out of stock item slots with handheld computers, called \\nTelxons.  The Telxon will inform the manager if the item is really in stock in the \\nbackroom.  If it is, the manager will add the item to the \\u201cpick-list\\u201d.  The pick-list will \\nthen be used to notify a backroom inventory specialist to select the item and place it in \\nthe sales slot as soon as possible.  If the item is not in the located in the backroom, the \\nhandheld unit will tell the employee that the inventory is not located within the store. The \\ndevice will inform the employee that the product is in transit, or needs to be ordered from \\nthe distribution center.   \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n17 \\nThis Telxon system provides an adequate way to measure and adjust quantities, \\nbut there are some problems within the system.  On-hand inventory can be inaccurate \\ncaused by issues such as; theft or \\u201cmis-ships\\u201d (items received are mislabeled or the \\nreceived quantity was inaccurate).  Therefore the inventory system shows available \\nproduct that is not really in the store.  This issue becomes more complicated as the \\nreenlistment process is reordering based on a wrong inventory level.   Another common \\nproblem is when a product is displayed in multiple departments or checkout registers.  \\nWhen an item has multiple placements, an item might be out of stock in some locations, \\nbut not in others.  An example would be a frontend checkout display in a mass retailer.  A \\nretail store might have a plan-o-gram which instructs the store to display the same items \\non ever checkout station.  If these items are located on regularly open registers, they will \\nquickly run out of stock.  These same items that are displayed on seldom open checkout \\nregisters will carry excess inventory.  Many systems such as Wal-Mart use a \\nreplenishment program based on average sales of items, insuring that inventory levels are \\nreplenished without having a large amount of back-stock inventory.  When a high traffic \\nregister is used, the inventory is depleted and not automatically restocked.  Therefore \\nthese systems using average sales or point of sales are not replenished correctly.  These \\nissues can lead to an on-going problem, creating mainly out of stocks, unless the system \\nis corrected manually by a store employee. \\nAccurate forecasting and customer specific marketing is another benefit of RFID.  \\nAccording to a study by Auto Id, using the technology can improve demand planning \\nforecast accuracy by 10-20%.  Planning and forecasting are important to every \\norganization because they reduce out of stocks, lower the risk of unsalable items, reduce \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n18 \\nexcess inventory levels, and improve efficiencies in distribution and other related costs   \\n(Smith, 2002). The reduction of inventory costs for the manufacturers from RFID can \\nprovide enormous savings both in \\u201cinventory on-hand\\u201d as well as reduced \\u201cfinished \\ninventory\\u201d. It is exciting to think that finished goods can be sent directly to wholesalers \\nor in some case to the retailers themselves. This process would eliminate the need for \\nregional storage warehouses or mixing warehouses for companies who produce certain \\nproducts in select plants and them merge or mix them in consolidated warehouse for re-\\nshipment to usually the distributor. These freight and storage savings can be passed on to \\nthe consumer in the way of lower pricing which will increase sales. \\nAnother advantage of RFID technology for the retailer is that the chip can identify \\nwhere the item was actually purchased, thereby helping them control receiving returns \\nfrom customers who purchased the product from another retailer. Returned goods cause \\nespecially large and costly problems for big box Stores like Wal-Mart, Sam\\u2019s, Costco, etc \\nas they have liberal return policies.  The Labor Savings derived from RFID, does not just \\nmean fewer checkers and support personnel but it will increase employees productivity. \\nAll retailers want to create a better, faster, and more enjoyable shopping experience to \\nattract and maintain customers.   RFID technology will provide the \\u201cperfect order\\u201d from \\nthe distributor or from the retailers own distribution centers. Currently, there are large \\ncosts associated with the issuance of credits and the resulting management of account \\npayables, due to mis-selects, overages and shortages. McLane estimates that every credit \\nthat is written costs over $25 in labor to process (McLane, 2009). These costs can be \\ngreatly reduced or eliminated with a RFID system for all parties in the supply chain.   \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n19 \\nUnsaleable items are those that are at the wrong place, or at the wrong time, or \\nappear damaged. An example of the latter would include; displaying snow shovels in the \\nmiddle of the summer, or still having Christmas candy on the shelves in February.  These \\ntypes of errors bloat the inventory in terms of dollars, take up valuable space to sell fresh \\nor current inventory, and finally necessitates the need to discount these items. Selling old \\nor out of season inventory items also implants the idea in the shoppers mind that the store \\nhas stale product.  In a study by the Unsaleable Committee, and organization made of \\nproducers and retailers, the grocery channel unsaleables were at a 1.27% of sales, which \\nis nearly 5 billions dollars in lost sales (Smith, 2002). \\nInvoice accuracy is also an issue that affects accurate forecasting; what is listed as \\nbeing received must be what is truly received.  Products with short shelf life or have \\nexpiration codes need to be accurately forecasted to reduce waste.  Inaccurate data and \\nhuman error can lead to further inaccurate forecasting with the final results as either \\nover/under supply.  There are also hidden costs associated with returns and credits \\n(Smith, 2002). \\nAs stated previously, out of stocks within the retail store is very costly to \\nbusiness.  According to a report by the GMA it is estimated on average that 8% are not in \\nstock in an average supermarket.  The study noted that promotional items or advertised \\nproducts were out of stock nearly 20% of the time.  Having out of stock items not only \\nmeans lost sales, but also can lead to customer dissatisfaction, and maybe encourage the \\nshopper to go elsewhere.  According to a research paper completed by Accenture for \\nsupermarket trade, potential for lost sales of 3% per year equals nearly $12 billion dollars \\nin lost sales revenue (Smith, 2002). \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n20 \\nCurrently many CPG companies gain forecasting knowledge by analyzing data \\nfrom companies such as A.C. Nielson, Information Resources, Inc. or IRI, and \\norganizational databases such as Wal-Mart\\u2019s retail link.  Many times companies will \\ninvest in other point of sale information and data made available from distributors and \\nwholesalers.  Data from resources such as A.C Nielson and IRI are typically out-of-date \\nand based on estimates and mathematical equations.  Information from organizational \\ndatabases such as Wal-Mart Retail Link can be valuable, but contains a relatively narrow \\nview as it is based on one company.   Furthermore, information gathered from Retail \\nLink may not explain why sales data changes so radically week to week.  Variables such \\nas weather, promos, and inventory levels are not included in the Retail Link data (Smith, \\n2002). \\nRFID will provide additional communication and data sharing throughout the \\nsupply chain.  RFID will also allow product to be tracked in real time and throughout the \\nsales process.  Better inventory data in warehouses means higher accuracy will be \\ncommunicated to manufacturers and retailers.  According to Auto Id they predict that \\nforecasting estimates can improve by 10-30% by implementing RFID technology.  \\nAdditionally, Auto ID predicts that manufacturers can see a 5-30% reduction in inventory \\nlevels, 2-13% reduction in warehouse and transportation costs, 1-5% in increased sales, \\nand 10-50% reduction in lead times.  They also predict that retailers can improve shelf \\nrate sales movement in retailers by 5-30%, 5-10% lower inventory levels, and 2-10% in \\nincreased overall retail sales (Smith, 2002). \\nWith an RFID based inventory, system retailers have a stronger knowledge \\nexchange and better visibility of all products within their store. A fully operational RFID \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n21 \\nsystem, where every item has a RFID tag, the retailer would have accurate knowledge of \\nall inventories and where the inventory is actually located in the store.  From the time the \\nproduct arrives at the store, to the moment the item is purchased by the consumer; the \\nstore could be able to monitor the inventory level and the inventory location. \\nAdditionally, the accurate inventory will cause the correct replenishment order to be \\nplaced or transmitted. The RFID system will reduce human error and eliminate current \\nsystem errors.   \\nAnother benefit of RFID is active management.  Active management allows for \\norganizations not only to see the location of their product, but also the environment \\nwhere it is stored.  For example, an organization that manufactures a product that is \\ntemperature sensitive such as yogurt could monitor and record the temperatures \\nthroughout the supply chain.  The organization would not only know that the product \\nmay be damaged or unsalable, but also be able to alert the distributor or warehouse and \\ninform them of the problem or issue before the product is received and shipped to the \\nretailer (Agarwal, 2001). \\nTheft and security is another major advantage of RFID.  Barcode and UPC \\ntechnology do not offer protection from theft.  Security tags are often applied to high \\nticket items such as electronics, but that can be costly and time consuming.  RFID tags \\ncan offer additional security throughout the products distribution and retail life.  RFID \\nreaders can warn stores and management when products are accidently or deliberately \\nbeing taken from the store.  Organizations will be able to better control shrinkage by \\nunderstanding the major causes on a real time basis (Agarwal, 2001). \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n22 \\nProducts with short shelf life or with expiration codes, for example milk or eggs, \\ncan be monitored to ensure they are rotated and sold before expiration.  In many cases \\nretailers fail to rotate their inventory, placing replenished items in front of older products.  \\nThis can be costly to the retailer in lost sales due to expiration dates.  Additionally, \\ncustomers can become frustrated when they arrive home and notice that the product they \\npurchased is expired or near expiration.  This can impact customer loyalty and discourage \\nrepeat business. RFID can identify products based on their expiration data and ensure the \\nproduct is properly rotated. Out of date product can then be quickly removed from shelf \\n(Agarwal, 2001). \\nProduct recalls and other mandates create issues for retailers, suppliers, and \\nmanufacturers. Often times, rather than pulling the batch number of a certain product, the \\nentire product line is pulled because it is difficult or impossible to trace the specific \\nproduct or batch.  For example, in December of 2009, Johnson and Johnson announced a \\nrecall of Tylenol Arthritis Pain tablets.  It was reported that this product had an unusual \\nodor and there were reports of consumers becoming ill.  The lack of specific information \\ncaused the recall to include many Tylenol pain relievers and also Motrin, Rolaids, and \\nBenadryl which are also manufactured at the same plants.  The total amount of product \\nrecalled included more than 54 million bottles.  Some of the products were found to \\ncontain a chemical called 2, 4, 6-tribomaonisole, it is now known that the odor was traced \\nto a chemical used to treat wooden pallets that Johnson and Johnson used to transport \\nthese items in only a few of their distributors (Berman, 2010).   Recalls costs retailers and \\nmanufacturers millions of dollars in lost sales and potentially destroy an entire brand or \\ncompany.  Technology found in RFID can streamline the of recall process.  RFID \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n23 \\nproducts can be programmed to contain much greater data on each chip enabling the \\ncompany to quickly zero in on a specific product rather than using the current \\u201cshotgun\\u201d \\nprocess. \\nRFID technology has the potential to save the entire supply chain substantial \\namounts in labor costs. Labor costs are a significant expense in the total supply chain, \\ncontributing to approximately 30% of overall supply chain costs (Chappell, 2002).  \\nReducing this cost can provide a large cost savings throughout the industry.  Many \\ncurrent systems use a process of manually scanning product and location barcodes.  For \\nexample, the current receiving and check-in process requires that an item or case barcode \\nmust be manually scanned and checked-in.  Items are compared to a receiving checklist \\nand labels are printed.  This process can be time consuming and is prone to human error.  \\nOrganizations can reduce labor costs by implementing an RFID system where labor is not \\nrequired to manually scan barcodes.  Cases and items that are brought into the \\ndistribution center will immediately be read, inventory amounts automatically adjusted, \\nand the storage location of the items recorded.  Items are quickly identified and \\ninaccuracies can quickly be resolved.   When the items are moved to a new location \\nwithin the warehouse, the RFID tag will automatically display its new location.  This will \\neliminate the need for an employee to scan the product and the location and eliminates \\nthe need to verify its location (Palmer, 2004).  When an order is filled, employees can \\nselect items and the system will automatically adjust inventory levels and verify the \\naccuracy of the order.  When shipping, items can be loaded directly on the outbound \\ntrailer or rail car and shipped.  In automated environments, the speed in which conveyers \\noperate will increase because there is no need for lasers to scan the product\\u2019s barcode.  In \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n24 \\na study by Accenture they estimated that using RFID could reduce labor costs by between \\n5 and 40 percent (Chappell, 2002).  \\nAnother advantage of RFID can be found at the retail store\\u2019s checkout station. \\nCurrently a typical shopping experience involves customers selecting products \\nthroughout the store and putting the items in baskets or carts.  When the customer \\ncompletes their shopping, they proceed to the checkout counter.   Items are taken out of \\nthe shopping cart and placed on a conveyor belt; a cashier will then manually scan items \\nwith a barcode laser scanner, which is typically located on the bottom of the register.  The \\ncashier will also have a handheld scanner that will be used to scan hard to reach barcodes \\non larger items.  This process can be cumbersome and slow and can lead to frustration.  \\nProducts with damaged barcodes or products, such as water, can interfere with the \\nscanner, forcing the cashier to manually enter the products UPC number into the cash \\nregister.  This procedure can holdup the checkout process and cause delays for all \\ncustomers.  With an RFID checkout system, all items can be read without even taking the \\nproduct out of the cart.  When a consumer walks through a tunnel reader with their \\nshopping cart, all items in the cart are automatically scanned by the RFID reader.  This \\nmethod can greatly improve the checkout process by reducing the time a customer waits \\nand will improve the overall customer satisfaction rate.  Additionally, the process can \\nreduce the amount of labor needed by the retailer to operate checkouts and increase the \\naccuracy of the order.  This can save the retailer meaningful labor costs and will increase \\ninventory turns due to improved accuracy.  \\nImproved marketing is another advantage of an RFID system.  Customer \\nshopping habits can be tracked while they are in the store.  Retailers can benefit from this \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n25 \\nknowledge by updating their plan o grams so that related or complimentary items are \\ndisplayed in areas and shelf locations that will stimulate increased customer purchases \\n(Sharpels, 2005).  RFID also allows greater sales tracking data that can be used to inform \\nretailers of what is being sold by Zip Code, enabling stores to stock what the consumers \\nwant to buy, rather than using regional or national plan-o-grams.  This increased data \\naccuracy can also stimulate mark-downs on product before short dating or out of date \\noccurs. Real time data also enables the manufacturer and retailer to plan \\u201clinked\\u201d \\npromotional activity whereby a well priced popular item is sold along with a lesser \\nknown product to stimulate the weaker items sales growth, i.e.: hair conditioner linked \\nwith shampoo.  Real time data also gives the retailer to quickly assess whether their \\ncurrent item placement, pricing, or promotional activity needs to be changed.    \\nObstacles of RFID in Consumer Packaged Goods \\nWhile RFID technology can benefit the consumer packaged goods industry, it \\nfaces a number of challenges and constraints that has slowed the adoption by retailers, \\nmanufacturers, and distributors.  These factors include the high costs of the silicon chips \\nthemselves, as well the hardware and software needed to operate systemically with all \\ntypes of chips, including \\u201csmart chips\\u201d.  In addition, there are a multitude of other \\nchallenges that have slowed the implementation across the CPG industry.   \\nThe high price of the RFID chip has historically been the largest obstacle in the \\nadoption of RFID in the CPG industry. Manufacturers, retailers, and distributors have \\nbeen hesitant to adopt RFID technology because it costs so much more than traditional \\nbarcodes and UPC systems.  It is a gigantic task for an industry to totally change how \\nthey do business. Retailers are beginning to recognize some of the benefits that an RFID \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n26 \\nsystem can have on their bottom line.  It reduces out-of-stock and shrinkage, and provides \\na better method for managing inventory and improves forecasting.  Manufacturers and \\ndistributors are also hesitant to adopt the technology; they too need to be convinced of the \\nbenefits for them, not just the retailer.   \\nTypically an RFID passive tags cost around $0.15 - $1.00 per tag in the United \\nStates.  Prices are subject to cost variations due to the technology and complexity \\ndepending on the type of the tag (Poirier, 2006).  These high costs makes it virtually \\nimpossible for a manufacturer of smaller CPG\\u2019s to implement the technology.  For \\nexample the cost of a 3 pack of Trident White Spearmint gum is $1.41.  Retailers in the \\nCPG industry usually look for a profit margin of around 30%.  Therefore the retail price \\nof the 3 pack of gum would be 1.98, with a $0.57 profit to the store.  If a RFID tag were \\nto be applied to every pack of gum, the cost of $0.20 would have large effects on the \\nprofit margin within the store.  The retail store would have to raise their prices to the \\nconsumer or the manufacturer would have to greatly lower or eliminate the profit of \\nevery item sold (Cadbury Profit Margin, 2010). \\nWhile RFID tags are not currently implemented on every individual product, they \\nare beginning to be used in case and pallet level tagging.  This method works for tracking \\nand validates delivery, and also allows the ability to track and monitor the movement in \\nthe supply chain.  Still it fails to derive the true benefits of having a total RFID tag \\nsystem for inventory, security, and forecasting.  Item level tagging would have to be \\nimplemented to realize the benefits of unit level handling.   \\nRecently Auto-ID has made advancements to lower the cost of RFID tags.  These \\ntags are much less complex, and simply store the electronic product code of the product.  \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n27 \\nThese chips are much smaller and much cheaper.    Auto-ID believes that they can soon \\nbegin to manufacture passive RFID chips for as little as $.05 (Swamy, 2006). \\nThe cost of individual tags is not the only barrier to implementation; there are \\nadditional costs to the supply chain.  These costs involve applying the tags to the \\nproducts, costs related to installing RFID tag readers in warehouses and manufacturing \\nplants, costs associated with integration into legacy systems, cost in training employees \\nand organization, and the cost of software and hardware solutions (Myerson, 2006). \\nConcerns have been concerning the ability of RFID to accurately read certain \\nproducts.  Products such as water, metal, and other materials have caused delays and \\ninaccuracies because of their inference with radio signals.  These products need special \\nconsideration when applying a tag because their material limits the read ranges.  The \\nfollowing table shows the read ranges of 915 MHz signals in feet (Myerson, 2006). \\n \\nTable 1: Read Ranges of Materials \\n \\n  Plastic  \\nMetal, \\nDirect \\nContact  \\nMetal, \\n.06\\\" \\nStand-off  Glass  Cardboard  \\nFree \\nSpace  Plywood  \\nContainer insert 4.5 .5 .5 8 3.5 3.5 6 \\nContainer tag 9.5 .25 .75 5 9 13 8 \\nIntelligent ID card 3.5 0 0 1.5 7.5 9 1.5 \\nReusable plastic \\ncontainer tag \\n10 1 3.5 4 6.5 6 7 \\nEncapsulated metal \\nmount stick tag \\n12.5 10 8 13 13 13 12 \\n\\\"Free space\\\" tag 4 0 0 4 11 12 10 \\nSource: Intermec. \\n(Myerson. 2006) \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n28 \\n \\nGlobal acceptance of a standard is another concern among the industry.  Although \\nthere have been efforts made to create standards for RFID and radio frequency there has \\nyet to be a complete accepted standard.  When dealing with a global distribution system, \\norganizations must consider frequencies and standards throughout the world.  \\nOrganizations are hesitant to invest large quantities of capital to promote a new \\ntechnology when the current system of bar-coding is acceptable and already \\nimplemented. \\nPrivacy is another major concern to the use of RFID technology in the CPG \\nindustry.  Consumers and end users of a product that has been tagged with an RFID chip \\nmay be unaware of the extent technology and its many uses.  When Gillette began \\npiloting its test program within Wal-Mart, they enabled a security measure that would \\nalert store personnel not only when restocking was needed, but also when high quantities \\nof products had been removed that could possibly be the result of shoplifting.  The \\nconsumer advocacy group Consumer Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and \\nNumbering, also referred to as CASPIAN, launched a campaign to alert consumer and \\nadvised to boycott Gillette products.  Many consumers then became aware of the \\npotential privacy violations (Poirier, 2006).  Some states began looking at laws to protect \\nconsumers.       \\nThe actual implementation of a new technology into the industry is another \\nobstacle in the adoption of RFID. The initial investment of installing hardware and \\nsoftware will be a significant cost to all members of the supply chain.  Costs would \\ninclude RFID readers, transponders, tags, and the systems and software to operate the \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n29 \\ntechnology. Training and support services must also be developed and maintained.   \\nAdditionally, software must be developed to insure that information gathered from the \\nnew system is gathered and stored properly so the information can be retrieved and used \\nfor business planning.   The amount of data that an RFID system will collect and store \\nwill demand much greater storage capacity than the current legacy systems.  \\nOrganizations must consider the amount of data that the new system will collect and store \\nand design software to manage the information (Sharpels, 2005).   \\n Implementing the new system will also require the industry to maintain the new \\nsystem with legacy systems.  While an organization moves to a new RFID supply chain \\nsystem, there will be redundancies with their existing barcode system.  This will require \\nthe organization to maintain two separate systems that require maintenance for a \\nsignificant period of time.  In addition, the two systems will require two separate \\noperating systems for data collecting and software processes.  Eventually, the new system \\nwill become the only system used, but the cost of maintaining an existing system while \\nimplementing a new system can be costly and difficult to maintain.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n30 \\nChapter 3 \\u2013 Methodology \\n In order to better understand the benefits and obstacles of RFID, this paper will \\nconduct a study of the McLane Company.  The McLane Company is a major distributor \\nin  the consumer packaged goods industry, and conducts business with some of the \\nlargest manufactures and retailers in the world.  The current distribution model and \\ntechnology used by the organization will be discussed and analyzed.  Fill rates and \\nreplenish processes using barcode technology will be discussed to determine if a new \\ntechnology such as RFID tags would improve fill rates, location, tracking, and efficiency. \\nThe McLane Company was chosen because of their distribution depth pertaining \\nto product mix and customer base.  They allowed full access to their Colorado \\ndistribution facility.  They also allowed interviews to be conducted with executives in \\ntheir logistics, information technology, and operational groups located in their corporate \\noffices in Temple, Texas.  The only request which they made was the opportunity to \\nreview the thesis prior to submittal and also to use the study internally for focus groups \\nassigned to RFID planning.     \\nThe case study was conducted by interviewing a number of McLane company \\nemployees and executive personnel over a 3 month period.  Information from each \\ndepartment was analyzed to gain a broad overview of the company and its practices. \\nDetailed information, regarding McLane\\u2019s current distribution practices, was recorded \\nand formatted.  Time was physically spent within one of McLane\\u2019s warehouses located in \\nLongmont, Co.  Operations and practices within the warehouse were recorded and \\nanalyzed.  In addition, data regarding current fill rates, efficiencies, and practices were \\ncaptured.  Information was gathered from McLane\\u2019s \\u201cSuperior Execution Measurements\\u201d \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n31 \\nwhich measures components of the business both internally and externally.  Data such as \\ntimely delivery, order quality, and teammate productivity was gathered and analyzed.  \\nSome of the proprietary information gathered from the McLane Company, particularly \\npoint of sale data from third parties, could not be directly referenced or included in this \\npaper. \\nThe final section of the case study will include the recommendation for implementing \\na RFID system within the McLane Company.  Benefits and constraints of implementing a \\nnew RFID system will be analyzed.  Finally, a business strategy for implementing an \\nRFID system will be recommended.    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n32 \\nChapter 4 \\u2013 Project Analysis and Results \\nIn order to understand the magnitude of implementing the new RFID system, it is \\nbeneficial to look at the distribution methods of a large wholesaler.  One such company is \\nthe McLane Company of Temple, Texas.  The McLane Company is a supply chain \\ncompany that provides grocery and foodservice distribution to convenience stores, big \\nbox stores, restaurant chains, and drug stores.  They are a $34 billion dollar organization \\nwith over 15,000 employees making it one of the largest distributors of CPG in the \\nUnited States (Kimborough, 2009). \\nMcLane Company operates 41 mega-distribution centers in the United States, one \\nof which is located Longmont Colorado. Weekly service is provided to nearly every Zip \\nCode in the lower 48 States, and weekly service is available to both Hawaii and Alaska \\nvia barge delivery.  Densely populated areas receive daily service when needed.  The \\ncustomer base is divided into four basic groups of customers: Convenience Stores, Big \\nBox Retailers, Military, and finally Foodservice.  The Grocery division handles the first \\nthree categories and the Foodservice handles only national or large regional quick serve \\nrestaurant chains.  The current annual volume is reported to be approximately $34 billion \\nand the company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Berkshire Hathaway Corporation \\n(Kimborough, 2009). \\nThe Grocery Division services more than 30,000 convenience stores with \\nvirtually everything that they stock, with the exception of alcohol and brand name soft \\ndrinks.  These are distributed directly by the individual manufacturers. The items they \\ndistribute include cigarettes, and other tobacco products, confections, dry groceries, \\nrefrigerated goods, frozen goods, paper products, janitorial supplies, and miscellaneous \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n33 \\ngoods. The military business is similar with a heavier emphasis on cigarettes and tobacco \\nproducts. The Big Box stores usually do their own distribution of the majority of their \\nown products but rely on McLane to supplement their distribution when it is more cost \\neffective.   McLane operates over three thousand multi-temperature semi trucks, which \\ndistribute; dry grocery, fresh, frozen, and dairy products.  Many of McLane\\u2019s customers \\nthat self distribute use only non-refrigerated trailers, so McLane saves them millions of \\ndollars in capital that it would cost to convert to multi-temperature equipment \\n(Kimborough, 2009). \\nMcLane purchases all goods centrally, with the top hundred vendors supplying \\nVMI (vendor managed inventory) services, a central purchasing department takes the \\nremaining items and divides them into industry recognized categories and buys and \\nmanages these accordingly.  Sophisticated buying formulas are used for replacement, \\nwith high emphasis on providing 99% fill rates on all categories except for cigarettes and \\ntobacco which McLane guarantees 100% fill rates. Many of the individual McLane \\ncustomer contracts contain clauses that guarantee these high fill rates and some have \\npenalties notated if McLane fails to provide them. These high fill rate guarantees also \\nplace enormous internal emphasis on inventory levels, as inventory turn becomes critical \\nto McLane\\u2019s profitability (Kimborough, 2009). \\nMost goods are delivered to McLane by truck in full truck quantities, smaller \\nvendors or specialty goods are received in LTL quantities. McLane backhauls \\napproximately 40% of all the goods it sells and receives goods 7 days per week in all of \\nits facilities. Currently McLane stocks approximately 18,000 SKUs or items and sells \\ngoods in full case, break pack, or individual quantities. Items that are less than full case \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n34 \\nreceive an additional mark-up. McLane uses a sophisticated receiving process wherein all \\ngoods are scanned by Smart Handheld Devices and are given a license plate or adhesive \\nlabel which is placed of every skid, identifying the manufacturer, date received, item \\nUPC code, also a McLane code. This code can be scanned to guarantee that all goods, \\nincluding imported goods are properly identified and traceable for recall/accounting \\nreasons. All perishable products are probed to insure that proper temperature was \\nmaintained during the shipping process.  Finally the license plate tells the forklift driver \\nwhere to place the goods for easy retrieval for replenishment, but also places the higher \\nmoving items in locations that are the closest to the actual selection area (Grogman, \\n2009). \\nFigure 1: McLane License Plate Example \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n35 \\n \\n(Jones T. McLane, 1998) \\nSmart Handhelds are used by drivers when delivering product.  The system is \\nintended to assist drivers in making more efficient and accurate deliveries.  It provides a \\nmethod for drivers to verify delivery items quickly, handle credits, manage high value \\nitems, and record store deposits.  The Smart Handheld can used to scan McLane barcodes \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n36 \\nor UPC.  Products can be scanned by section, by container or case, or by individual item  \\n(Grogman, 2009). \\nThe system works by downloading load-specific billing and sales information into \\nthe delivery device.  The devices are then matched to the correct driver teams by \\ndispatchers.  Information such as container count by section, total number of full cases, \\nand number of cigarettes for the driver to match against are provided.  The driver will \\nthen scan all items to verify the delivery of the product.  The driver will scan return \\ncredits and manually enter deposit counts.  The delivery report is printed and signed and \\nthe driver returns to the division for end day reports (Grogman, 2009). \\nThe put-away process is accomplished using radio controlled data that is \\ntransmitted from the receiving data to dashboard mounted radio receivers on the forklifts; \\nit instructs the operator where to put the product but also gives the process a put away \\npriority in the event that the product is needed in a pick location quickly. The inbound \\ndata also automatically updates the available inventory which enables a real time \\nperpetual inventory system (Grogman, 2009). \\nThe next step is the receiving of the actual customer orders, which are received \\nand held in an order collection data bucket and released based on a predetermined order \\ndelivery date and exact truck delivery time.  These orders are placed either directly in \\nmass EDI download communication (usually used by large national companies with their \\nown mainframe support) or with Smart Handhelds,  wherein the customer uses the device \\nto count their existing inventory and then reorders based on a standing inventory basis, or \\nperhaps a more advanced customized approach using historical data that the SHH \\nprovides.  McLane even has the ability to provide special SHH software for a weekly fee \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n37 \\nwhich enables customers to order automatically in case of power outages or other related \\nordering problems. Even more advanced software is available for a customer that adheres \\nto a manufacturers program.  The marketing programs might require a constant in-stock \\nor brand depth availability program that would mean large rebates if the retailer met the \\nprograms contract (Lyon, 2010). \\nSmart Handhelds is a device system that McLane provides to customers.  It \\nprovides an easy and efficient way for the retailer to view items and displays, as well as \\nplacing and uploading orders.  In addition, the device allows the retailer to download up \\nto date information and receive messages and communication for McLane.  The device \\nallows the retailer to scan UPC barcodes; Items can also be searched through item \\nnumber and description.  The system will provide a purposed order based on order \\nhistory at the department and at item level.  The handheld system helps improve order \\ninput quality, reduces order entry confusion, improves data accuracy, and improves the \\nforecast based on item movement (Lyon, 2010) \\nBelow is a diagram overview of the McLane Smart Handheld ordering process \\nflow. \\nFigure 2: System Process Flow \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n38 \\nCustomer downloads new \\norder guide and invoice \\nhistory to unit.\\nAble to review distribution \\nscheduled to ship\\nCreate order aided with \\nsuggested quantities from \\nstore specific invoice history\\nOrder review by invoice \\ncategory showing total \\nquantity and dollar amount to \\nbe ordered\\nAble to review all items by \\ncategory and make changes \\nto quantity\\nAble to review all items not \\nordered by category and \\nmake changes to quanity.\\nAble to review only ordered \\nitems by category and make \\nchanges to quanity\\nAble to review items by trait \\nby invoice category including \\nnewly authorized and \\ndistribution only categories\\nUpload order to McLane via \\ndial up connection\\nReceive order confirmation \\nnumber on unit\\nOrder received and \\nprocessed by Mclane\\n \\nOnce the orders are received either through mass EDI transmissions or SHH \\ntransmissions, they are automatically sorted by the mainframe order processing system \\nwhich assigns each individual order a specific number.  This determines in what sequence \\nthe orders will be selected, loaded, and dispatched.  Every customer has a predetermined \\ndelivery day and time which they selected.  The next major step is the actual printing of \\nthe invoices and the selection labels which will be the guide for the warehouse staff to \\npick the right item.  An average customer orders items which are in actually stored in \\nseven different departments; dry full case, frozen full case, single sell, frozen/refrigerated \\nsingle cell, cigarettes, and candy repack, . Therefore the selection labels are printed by \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n39 \\ndepartment and sent out for selection. These labels are coded with a myriad of data but \\nthe most important are: order number, load number, McLane item number, and pick \\nlocation.  Each selector works in a predetermined work area that might encompass \\nanywhere from 15 to 100 feet. The selector has a glove like scanner affixed to one of \\ntheir hands which has the bar code scanner on the index finger.  The selector picks up a \\nsheet of labels, scans the main order code with his finger and a light will go in the \\nspecific bin of where the item to be selected is with an illuminated number indicating the \\nnumber of items to be picked. The selector picks the correct number and turns out the \\nlight, the tote which contains the product then is placed on the conveyor and moves to the \\nnext zone where the process is repeated. Finally the Tote or case has traveled thru the \\nentire department and is then sealed and sent to the high speed sortation conveyors which \\nmerge all products from all departments. The merge operator then asks for each order to \\nbe released and high speed push roads send the right product in the right order down \\nconveyors which actually go right into a truck trailer. Loaders are at the bottom of the \\nconveyors and rescan each product to validate that it is the correct item going to the \\ncorrect customer on the correct load.  The scan data also allows every selector to be \\ntracked in terms of number of pieces selected by hour, same for the loaders, and in the \\nevent there is an error, the mis-selected can be traced back to the person who made the \\nerror (Lyon, 2010). \\nThe truck is loaded and is dispatched at the proper time; orders are guaranteed to \\narrive within a two hour window, so customers can staff their receiving departments \\naccordingly. All trucks are equipped with GPS scanning antennae so a truck is constantly \\n\\u201cpinged\\u201d to make sure that it is running on time and on the proper route. This same data \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n40 \\ncan be accessed by the customer via the internet to find out where their truck is located \\nexactly.  When the delivery is made, the drivers scan the cases and totes as they are \\nplaced in the customer\\u2019s store. If there is a missing or damaged case or item, the driver \\ncan issue an electronic credit immediately.  The current standard which McLane has set \\nfor order error is .20% or 99.8% accuracy (Lyon, 2010). \\nTransitioning To RFID \\nWhile the current system is extremely efficient, McLane is always open to new \\nand better technology.  They aim to be on the forefront of the latest innovations.  They \\nwant to not only stay competitive, but to stay ahead of their competitors by providing the \\nbest and most accurate service.  They are always ready to adapt to change if it leads to \\nbetter costumer service.  The size and volume of an organization such as McLane makes \\nit difficult to implement even a small system change, much less a total overhaul in its \\ncore distribution model.   \\nImplementing an RFID system must be done by developing a business strategy \\nthat is well documented and defined.  First the benefits of the new system must be \\ncommunicated and discussed with business partners and customers.  The system must be \\nvalidated to ensure that customers understand how the system works and how it affects \\ntheir business.  Second the system must be rolled out in select waves and pilot programs.  \\nCustomers that are interested in implementing and testing the new system should be the \\nfirst to run pilot tests.  The services and functions of the new system must be given a \\nstandard or goals and then method developed to ensure that these functions and \\nobjectives are met.  Finally, documentation and data collection must be done to measure \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n41 \\nthe costs associated with the program.  Sales and performance standards must be \\ncarefully analyzed and compared to previous results to obtain a benchmark.   \\nIt is the belief of McLane that a RFID system could increase their productivity in all \\nareas. Items could be received quicker and placed in the proper bins with fewer errors. \\nThe same is true for production selection speed and finally delivery order rates. Perfect \\norders would be possible, and perfect orders mean high customer satisfaction. If one \\nplaces a dollar value of running at a 99.8% accuracy rate, then the dollar impact from \\nitems that are either over, short or damaged equal over $60 million when the net sales are \\n$30 billion per year. \\nThe conversion to the use of RFID tags has started, but like any other enormous \\nproject faces many challenges. Not all manufacturers have the capital to invest in the \\nequipment to affix the chip to their individual products. Other major issues are created \\nwhen the USA continues to import goods from Third World Countries to save on product \\ncosts and sell at the lowest prices. Lower costs sometimes mean lesser adherence to our \\nidentification specifications.  What are the hidden distribution costs associated with non-\\nRFID labeled products? \\nThe solution lies in several types of approaches. The first is one in which a \\nseparate third party company installs and operates the RFID equipment at the \\nmanufacturing site on a fee basis. The manufacturer would not have to make major \\ncapital investments and could pass along the costs to the consumer, or by maintaining \\ntheir prices by recouping the costs by better managing the entire manufacturing process. \\nBetter data will both reduce raw or finished goods and more accurate sales data will aid \\nthem in producing inventory of what is selling.   \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n42 \\nAnother solution is for distributors, such as McLane to provide the RFID chip for \\na fee, charging back the cost to the manufacturers. McLane could affix to every case or \\nindividual item a customized RFID chip which would be produced from blank chips. This \\nprocess would replace what McLane is currently doing with their own label process but \\nwould require major capital investments in all their centers to use chips versus labels.    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n43 \\nChapter 5 - Conclusion \\n \\nRFID technology has an important future role in the supply chain network.  This \\npaper has focused on consumer packaged goods, but similar savings, accuracy, and speed \\nare applicable to numerous other classes of trade. \\nAny new system or technology requires capital, time, and planning to proceed. \\nHowever the first real first step is to expose the merits of RFID technology to every \\nsegment of the supply chain, including the consumer. \\nThis paper exposes and explores the details and benefits of this new technology, \\nbut in order to succeed, the term RFID must become a household word.  A strong \\nrecommendation is that a joint committee should be formed by the companies who would \\nmost benefit from its implementation;   silicon chip manufacturers, hardware \\nmanufactures, software development firms, etc.  Their first order of business is to fund \\npresentation and media materials that will educate and establish the benefits of this \\nrevolutionary new technology.  All forms of media have to be controlled to deliver a \\nconsistent message.  Keeping \\u201cconsistent\\u201d as the main component, custom detailed \\nversions have to be developed for every step in the supply management chain.  The type \\nof detail and benefits will be different for the manufactures, distributors, transporters, \\nimporters, retailers (national and independent), and finally the consumer. \\nWal-Mart has already made progress in advancing the technology, which should \\ngive them a head start.  Distributors, such as McLane, with existing automated platforms \\nwill also have an advantage over those employing manual techniques. This same \\nadvantage applies to previously mentioned manufactures, such as Proctor& Gamble, who \\nare currently working with Wal-Mart by applying RFID chips to their top selling items. \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n44 \\nThe critical challenge is to educate the consumer as to what RFID technology is \\nand how it will benefit them, stressing lower retail prices as the main outcome. All the \\nMedia used; print, radio, television, or internet based, has to be pro-active in anticipating \\nquestions and providing answers.  Questions such as, \\u201cAre my personal shopping habits \\nbeing divulged?\\u201d or \\u201cHow do I know that I paid the right price for an individual item?\\u201d \\ncan be answered before the consumer can even ask them.  The technology can be \\nembraced and supported even before it reaches full roll out status. \\nThe entire conversion process will take time, tests musts be run, mistakes made, \\nand the resulting learning incorporated as solutions.  However the final product will \\ndeliver a superior technology which will move the entire supply chain forward into the \\nfuture; Better, Faster, Cheaper. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nEFFECTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY \\n \\n45 \\nReferences: \\n \\nHardgrave, B., Waller, M., Miller R.

In the global economy, supply chain is part of everyday business across industries, and retailing is a leading example. On this 25th anniversary of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management we look at how the concept of supply chain management was introduced in retailing and how it has evolved over time. This exercise is based on a selective review of OXIRM publications between 1990 and 2010, mainly articles from the Retail Digest (formerly the European Retail Digest).Supply, distribution, and sourcing have always existed in retailing, even when they were labelled differently. International and even transcontinental trade have their precedents from centuries ago, when products were imported from all parts of the new World to Europe, and local goods exported in the opposite direction. What has changed, however, is scale, speed, integration, transparency and control. Today\\u2019s retailers have opportunities to manage and control the end-to-end flow of goods and associated information. To achieve the current level of supply chain integration, well over a decade was needed, during which different concepts, ideas and technical solutions were proposed, tried, adopted or rejected. In 1995, the European Retail Digest included an article by Henk de Wilt and Trichy Krishnan1, following an OXIRM European Retailing Seminar dedicated to the concept of supply chain management. So let\\u2019s look how the concept of supply chain management evolved in retailing, how this was reflected in OXIRM publications, and what was written about supply and logistics both before that Digest article in 1995 and after.SUPPLY CHAIN IN THE 1990S: BIRTH AND FOCUS ON EFFICIENCYEven though supply chain management was present in the retail literature in the late 1980s and early  1990s, its function was still largely considered as operational, as part of the  retail distribution system. However, the potential strategic impact was noted by eminent retail academic and prolific writer John Fernie in his book published in 1990 on retail distribution management. The European Retail Digest was established in 1993 as a flagship publication for the Oxford Institute of Retail Management. The quarterly publication\\u2019s aim was and remains to bring rigorous research and sound practice to academics, practitioners, analysts and commentators focused on the retail industry. Earlier OXIRM research was published in the series of Oxford Reports of Retailing. In 1992, following the signing of the Maastricht Treaty that created a common market for 12 countries in Europe, reports concentrated on retail internationalisation, where the importance of supply chain was acknowledged. Free flow of goods across borders and transport deregulation influenced supply chain design, encouraging a European perspective instead of focusing at the national level. The creation of the common trans-European transport network (TEn) was actively supported by the European Commission with the establishment of \\u2018transport corridors\\u2019, while changes in eastern and central Europe opened new markets and provided lower-cost manufacturing. One of the internal success factors required for internationalisation was control over supply chains, which allows high responsiveness to changes in consumer tastes, as explained in the introduction to the Oxford Report on Retail in the run-up to the 1992 treaty3. The importance of control over the supply chain, and the blurring of the division between retailing, distribution and manufacturing was discussed in the 1988 OXRIM report written by Alan Treadgold and Ross Davies4.  In 1993, the concept of supply chain management as the next step in the development of physical distribution management and logistics management was already present in retailing, with a dedicated chapter in books, such as Gary Davies book on trade marketing strategy5. A similar trend was reflected in the European Retail Digest. Efficient customer response (ECR) and its implications for just-in-time grocery supply chain were discussed, with the main focus on increased efficiency in the assortment, replenishment, promotions, and new product introductions. However this discussion was mainly based on US examples, revealing opportunities for efficiency improvements in the UK and France6.

The same edition of the Digest included a paper that concentrated on pan-European returnable transit packaging in grocery supply chains7. Both articles listed key drivers for supply chain development.The increased tendency to shorten and increase the efficiency of supply chains, thus reducing costs were explored further in the Digest in 19968. This was also the time when the focus moved from internationalisation to globalisation, to look for further opportunities to extend operations, brand building and sourcing, not only into eastern and central Europe, but also to Asia and the Middle East - to the regions where integrated supply chains were still at the early stages of development9. Such regional differences required to build a retailer\\u2019s supply chain from scratch was described in the example of the Office Depot entry to Poland, emphasising the importance of knowledge transfer and training10. Recognition of the differences in the local markets was seen as a requirement to operate a supply chain, build infrastructure and develop relationships efficiently. Retailers, taking advantage of scale and global supply, emphasised the importance of local marketing and multicultural organisations11. At the end of the last millennium, a new theme was introduced related to the globalised scope of operations: social rights and agreed labour standards12,13. The second theme was the integration of e-commerce into the supply chain and the advantages of online traders with established logistics and distribution structure, as discussed by Jonathan Reynolds14, as well as the impact of information technology on retailer-supplier relationships as discussed by Richard Cuthbertson15. On the customer side, mobile-commerce had been presented as a future opportunity16. Supply chain management became a key issue and a major success factor in global retailing. As retailers increased the scale of their operations, the critical mass to allow the design of expensive supply networks was achieved, according to Elizabeth Howard17. However, as was pointed out, world-trade was still in practice mainly regional and there was some shift from thinking globally to look at the regions with common economic and cultural features18, this tendency went further with the re-introduction of local supply from national/regional sources19. SUPPLY CHAIN FROM 2000: KEY COMPETENCE, GLOBALISATION AND PERFORMANCEIn the new century, there was a whole Digest issue dedicated to the supply chain relationships and best practices exchange20. The edition included an article from Richard Cuthbertson on exchanging best practice with Tesco, and one from Gerd Islei and Johannes Becker on performance measurement in supply chains. Since 2001, articles on supply chain and supply chain management have regularly appeared in all Digest issues in the form of research, interviews, conference and book reviews. This is no surprise as now supply chain is perceived as a core competency for retailers, as it integrates people and processes, allows flexible and responsive design, includes local and global suppliers, performance measurement and return logistics21. It has become one of the main OXIRM research themes.The Winter 2003 edition of the Digest was dedicated to two main themes: supply chain in retailing and the enlargement of the European Union, planned for 2004, when eight central European countries and Malta and Cyprus were to join the EU. The sub-themes in supply chain included benchmarking through a presentation of the GLOSUP project. OXIRM was involved in the CIES Global Supply Chain Performance (GLOSUP) initiative. During the project, a benchmarking tool for supply chain was developed22. Application of benchmarking at Gillette was presented23 to demonstrate supply chain improvement and alignment. Supply chain flexibility, efficiency achieved via benchmarking and the need to select different supply chains for different countries, the importance of reverse logistics and collaboration were listed as key factors for supply chain success24.

This book, written for supply chain and logistics managers and in cooperation with practitioners, answers questions such as:-  What is a successful supply chain strategy?-  How should supply chain performance be measured?-  How should organisation be managed?-  How should stakeholders be influenced?-  How can unexpected events be incorporated?We include examples from a wide range of real-life case studies, and synthesise the learning from these many different situations to provide the fundamental building blocks at the centre of successful logistics and supply chain management.environmental and social dimensions33, as well as differences in cultures and the different needs of different countries, including OXIRM\\u2019s continued interest in developments in India34,35.SUPPLY CHAINS TODAY: LATEST OXIRM RESEARCHBetween 2006 and 2010, OXIRM members (including the author of this article) carried out research for the European Commission, as part of the Bestlog (Best Practices in Logistics) project team. We looked at links  between supply chain and sustainable development, including areas such as: supply chain performance measurement36, education, best practices, and the transferability of best practices across industries, sectors, countries and regions37. Our research was based not only on the academic literature and an analysis of existing case studies, but also our study of different supply chain practices across Europe. We ran a number of workshops with policymakers and practitioners. The project covered several industrial sectors, and retailers, due to their important role in the supply chain, were well-represented. We collaborated with retailers such as IKEA, Marks & Spencer, Inditex and Auchan, as well as with third-party logistics providers that work with retailers such as Wincanton and Unipart. While the BestLog project was formally completed, its work is carried forward by the European Logistics Association (visit ELAbestLog Platform at www.elabestlog.org to see reports, analysis and best practice case studies \\u2013 including cases from the retail sector).During the BestLog research we confirmed and indentified several main themes, which are summarised in a forthcoming book. The aim of the project was to help managers to develop supply chains that are sustainable in three dimensions: economic, social and environmental. While it is easy to label supply chains \\u2018green\\u2019 for marketing purposes, to be sustainable in the long-term the whole chain should deliver economic value for all its participants. However, increasing centralisation, outsourcing of transportation and the tendency to design global supply chains creates external costs for the environment and society. As a result of supply chain redesign there is an increased need for transport services, especially in its most flexible form \\u2013 road transport. External costs associated with transport include pollution, congestion and accidents, which also negatively influence retailers in terms of reduced speed, flexibility, costs, and potential damage to the company reputation. Thus in the long-term, a reduction of the negative impacts could be profitable for all supply chain members. Such a process requires the inclusion of sustainability issues into strategy and long-term planning, and the development of measures that reflect the impact of the supply chain on economic, social and environmental dimensions (see figure). The integration of products, processes, knowledge and infrastructure, as well as communication with all the relevant stakeholders is essential. As two large markets, India and China, develop rapidly, there is an opportunity to provide for the rising customer demand. However, this further increase in the scope of activities requires new skills to operate in different cultural and political contexts. In the search for efficiency and economy of scale, there is also the issue of how to maintain supply chain flexibility, agility in the face of uncertainty, and how to manage the expected and unexpected risks, as the supply chain become global.nowadays, the role of supply chain management is different, having evolved from being a supportive function, through becoming a core competence, to the stage where it enables the increased power of retailers over suppliers. Today, retail has become the last step to the consumer in an integrated supply chain that links not only different markets, but also cultures, with the aim of delivering value to all its participants.1231cetinkaya et al.balkan cetinkaya \\u00b7 richard cuthbertson, graham ewer \\u00b7 thorsten klaas-wissing, wojciech piotrowicz \\u00b7 christoph tyssenPractical Ideas for Moving Towards Best Practicecetinkaya \\u00b7 cuthbertson \\u00b7 ewer klaas-wissing \\u00b7 piotrowicz \\u00b7 tyssen Sustainable Supply Chain ManagementThis book focuses on the need to develop sustainable supply chains \\u2013 economically, environmentally and socially.This book is not about a wish list of impractical choices, but the reality of decisions faced by all those involved in supply chain management today.Our definition of sustainable supply chains is not restricted to so-called \\u201cgreen\\u201d supply chains, but recognises that in order to be truly sustain-able, supply chains must operate within a realistic financial structure, as well as contribute value to our society. Supply chains are not sustain-able unless they are realistically funded and valued. Thus, a real defini-tion of sustainable supply chain management must take account of all relevant economic, social and environmental issues.This book contains examples from a wide range of real-life case studies, and synthesizes the learnings from these many different situations to provide the fundame tal building blocks at the centre of successful logistics and supply chain management.Sustainable Supply Chain ManagementSustainable Supply Chain ManagementSustainable Supply Chain Management57801  WMXDesign GmbH Heidelberg \\u2013 Bender   15.4.10                           Dieser pdf-file gibt nur ann\\u00e4hernd das endg\\u00fcltige Druckergebnis wieder !

31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  2  introduction a growing number of traditional store-based retailers are becoming multi-channel retailers by opening an additional online-channel to offer their customers multiple ways of buying and interaction. at the same time, former pure online-retailers are opening stores or physical pick-up points to allow their customers physical interaction and product pick-up. multi-channel retailing got primary attention principally in the field of multi-channel marketing (e.g. wirtz, 2008). marketing literature and scholarly research address multi-channel marketing mainly focusing on customer behavior on the one side (e.g. venkatesan et al, 2007) and the conflicts between channels on the other side (e.g. falk et al, 2007; avery et al, 2009). several authors (e.g. schr\\u00f6der, 2005; schobesberger, 2007; heinemann 2008, 2009) analyze different multi-channel strategies and implications on a retailers' marketing mix.  whereas operational implications of online retailing have received attention since the end of the 1990s (e.g. turban et al, 2009; swaminathan & tayur, 2003), specific analysis of operational implications of multi-channel retailing remains scarce. agatz et al (2008) reviewed the specific supply chain management issues of internet fulfillment in a multi-channel environment. they identified an important number of topics relevant for e-fulfillment, but recognized that there are only very few dedicated models on multi-channel retailing.  multi-channel retailers with different business models are using different fulfillment systems to deliver the products to their customers: the online shop of the french retailer fnac (cultural and electronics products), fnac.com, started its online activity completely separated from its store activity, with different warehouse locations and fulfillment organizations. they gradually integrated their logistics activities and are operating today a fully integrated warehouse, preparing deliveries for the stores as well as for the individual online customers. tesco.com, the online shop of the major uk retailer tesco, prepares the customer's orders exclusively in the tesco store next to the customer (smith & sparks, 2009). so does monoprix.fr, the online shop of the french city-center supermarket chain monoprix. these observations suggest that a specific multi-channel business model may induce a specific, most suitable fulfillment system. if this is the case, it should then be possible to evaluate how a fulfillment system fits a given business model.  hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  3  from an operational point of view, fulfillment systems have to be mainly time- and cost-efficient. from a strategic marketing point of view, the fulfillment system has to be able to meet the customers' expectations created by the chosen business model. we therefore propose to develop a qualitative framework to evaluate how a specific multi-channel fulfillment system matches the business model of multi-channel retailers both in terms of the expectations of their customers on the one hand and the economic performances on the other hand. this framework should serve as basis for further empirical studies. our paper is organized in two parts: in the first part, we will highlight the main characteristics of multi-channel retailing and present the major elements of the retailers' strategy, the retail mix, which have to be adapted to a multi-channel retailing strategy. 1 we then will explore the specific operational challenges to be faced when operating a multi-channel activity.  this first part will be completed with the presentation of the five major multi-channel fulfillment systems used to deliver products to the customers. in the second part, we will propose a qualitative analysis framework in order to evaluate the overall performance of a given fulfillment system, combining the two dimensions 'customer expectations' and 'economic performance'. the parameters of the framework as well as its applications will be based on the analysis of the strategic and operational challenges developed in the first part. applying the analysis framework to the five major fulfillment systems leads us to discuss how each of the systems impacts the different parameters. we conclude our paper presenting managerial implications and suggested future research avenues to provide evidence if our framework is valid for our purpose.  methodology our analysis is based on the one hand on our longitudinal industry observation of retailers' practices, completed with the analysis of company information and press articles. moreover,                                                  1 in our paper, we will concentrate on multi-channel retailers operating at least several physical stores and an online sales channel under the same brand and with the same types of products. moreover, we focus on the distribution of physical products, as dematerialized products do not need a physical distribution. we exclude as well specific configurations (which may nonetheless be dominant in particular sectors), like delivery from manufacturers or 'complex assortments' (de koster, 2002) with bulky items and temperature sensitive goods. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  4  we conducted a series of interviews with french and uk senior operations managers and consultants in the retail sector. this observation allowed us to identify five major multi-channel fulfillment systems. to be able to evaluate these fulfillment systems regarding the two dimensions 'economic performance' and 'customer expectations', we have to identify the relevant parameters to integrate into our proposed framework. to do so, we analyzed marketing and operations general literature and scholarly research. exploration of the main strategy elements and operational challenges suggests number of parameters, indicating economic performance and customer expectations. we completed the identified parameters for evaluating customer expectations with dimensions from the servqual and netqual scales, measuring service quality perception from the customers. these parameters of our framework will be the dependent parameters, whereas the analyzed fulfillment systems will be the independent parameters. the exploration of the strategy factors and economic performances in the first part will allow us to apply the framework to the different fulfillment models by assessing the chosen performance parameters for each of the fulfillment systems. this shall provide a global evaluation for the each of the analyzed fulfillment systems.  strategy factors in multi-channel retailing the objective of this chapter is to summarize the context of multi-channel retailing as well as the main drivers for customer expectations and economic performances, which will enable us to identify the relevant parameters to use in our proposed framework. we will first present the main characteristics of multi-channel retailing. we then will investigate how the business model of a multi-channel retailer, characterized by different elements of the retail mix, will have to be adapted to a multi-channel strategy. an exploration of the major operational challenges for a multi-channel retailer will conclude this chapter.  multi-channel retailing: characteristics & customer behavior worldwide retailing is still dominated by the traditional store retailing, as 95% of food retailing and 80% of non-food retailing is realized through physical store-based retailers (dioux & dupuis, 2009), and online channels still represent only a small part of the total sales of the retailers. nevertheless, the motivation to open online sales-channels is strong due to the fact that e-commerce is realizing important annual turnover growth rates of about 30% for the hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  5  last few years, whilst most other retail forms stay stable or even decline. it is therefore interesting for a store retailer to invest in the creation of an additional online sales channel.  to implement a multi-channel strategy, retailers have to decide how to adapt their business model by adjusting the elements of the retail mix. at the same time, they have to face and resolve numerous operational challenges. in multi-channel retailing, customers expect at least the same level of service, counsel, and information on every channel (cf. heinemann, 2008). they expect to have identical customer loyalty programs across all channels, to be able to pay and pick up in the shop a product ordered on the web site, or to be able to return and exchange a product bought on the web in a store (berman & thelen, 2004). this channel hopping, which is a legitimate desire from a customer's point of view, may nevertheless prove to be very difficult to implement for the retailer (vanheems, 2009). at the same time, online shoppers transfer their perception and experiences from a physical store to the website of the same brand and vice versa. customers tend to transpose a bad experience in one channel to the other channels of the same distributor (heinemann, 2008). as soon as their expectations are not fulfilled, they may adapt their purchasing habits, in the worst case stop buying with this retailer at all. it is therefore vital for a multi-channel retailer to make sure that every channel always meets the same level of expectations of the customers.  multi-channel retail mix  the retail mix consists of the mix of variables, including geographical location, merchandising, communication, price, services, product range and the personnel, which form the overall strategic marketing components of a retailing activity. it is the right mix of all these factors which determines if a retail concept is viable and successful. compared to a store retailer, the online sales channel is not only a new channel, but rather a new business model, where experiences from the traditional (brick and mortar) store channel may not be valid any more (heinemann, 2008). decisive success factors in a store like store location, sales personnel and material management in the shop are not the same success factors in an online sales channel. retailers which decide to open an e-commerce activity beside their existing store sales channel have to make sure that the co-existence of the two sales channels is working well. they have to decide how to adapt the different elements of the retail mix to each channel, hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  6  which product strategy to chose, which prices to apply, how to maintain a consistent image across the channels or what role to assign to each channel, to name a few (cf. berman & evans, 2009). we will briefly describe the major issues of some of the most important variables of the retail mix, assessing their relevance and importance in the store, the online channel and the multi-channel strategy. product mix the product mix is the major variable determining the activity of a retailer. it establishes if a retailer is specialized in selected product categories or a generalist. if a store based retailer opens an additional online channel, he has to decide which product mix he offers on this new channel. he can offer the identical product mix, a combination or part of his existing product mix or a completely different additional product mix on the new channel. location of the stores a physical store's success is to a great extend influenced by its location. in order to determine if the location can attract the store's target customers, a store based retailer has to analyze socioeconomic data, transport access, mix of competitors, costs and regulation issues. these parameters, decisive for a physical store, have generally no influence on a pure online sales channel, as access to the websites is independent from a geographical location. in a multi-channel strategy, however, the store location remains important; the density of the store network can be an important factor for offering store pick-up, returns and after sales services in the stores for their online customers. pricing the pricing policy applied in a store may take into consideration the environment of the store (socioeconomic characteristics of the geographical catchment area) and the price levels of the local competitors. such a local pricing policy which can be applied in a store is incompatible with the global price transparency in an online channel and the exposure to price comparisons. the pricing policy of a multi-channel retailer encounters specific difficulties: the global price transparency on the internet, the specific cost structures of the store and the online channel, hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  7  the existence of specific offers and the different means of payment render it difficult to apply a consistent pricing policy across all channels. especially the price transparency makes it difficult for a retailer to offer different prices for the same product on different sales channels. service, store pick-up and return a multi-channel service offer can be composed of special delivery options (delivery speed, delivery timing, information on order status), the exchange policy, return policy, refunding, after sales service, payment options and consumer credits. multi-channel retailers can offer either to deliver the order to the customer's home or to let the customer pick-up the order in one of the stores. this service allows the customer to pick up the order whenever he likes, even sooner than with home delivery.2 allowing customers in-store return or exchange can avoid the cost and time of returning via mail. at the same time, this offers an important possibility for the retailer to create a personal contact between the client and the sales personnel to increase customer loyalty and to generate additional sales. personnel the sales personnel play a decisive role in stores. they welcome clients, provide counsel and advice and can influence sales. their behavior and attitude contribute in an important way to the atmosphere and ambiance of the store and its concept.  this important parameter in a store is irrelevant in a pure online channel, except for telephone hotline contacts or the delivery service personnel. in a multi-channel strategy, however, the store personnel have to be able to orient and counsel the client using different channels. it is very important for the client not to perceive any differences or barriers between the channels.  operational challenges of multi-channel retailing in general, the operational organization of a retailer is mainly focused on efficient store replenishment, lowering costs and shortening the product turnover time.                                                  2 in case of unavailable items, the retailer can chose to send the missing items directly to the customer and only reserve the available items in the store for pick-up. in this case, the customer experience will be negative, as the customer's decision to pick up his order in the store can't be fulfilled.   hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  8  to offer an online channel to its customers, a retailer has to be able to manage its operations in a very different way from its physical store activity. e-fulfillment may be considered as one of the most expensive and critical operations of internet retailers (de koster, 2002), logistics and stock management becoming core competencies (benghozi, 2001). keeping stock of a high number of different references, making it available, picking and packing, sending and delivering quickly at a low cost are the numerous constraints to respect. in the following, we will present and discuss the main operational issues, which are decisive for the overall performance of the multi-channel retailing. product availability product availability is one of the most important parameters for customer satisfaction (browne, 2009). a store customer usually can compare the products present in the store. availability is indicated through the simple presence of a product in the store shelve. a customer can ask the sales personnel if there is any stock of the product or when it will be available again. an online client needs to have all this information indicated on the website together with the product information. the online channel offers the possibility to display the remaining stock of a chosen product, or even, in a multi-channel context, the remaining stock and the location of the store where the product is available for testing, purchasing or withdrawal. displaying the availability of products or the delay of their replacement is an important marketing tool impacting the sales and influencing customer satisfaction.  stock keeping stores usually receive deliveries either directly from the manufacturer or from one or several logistics platforms with either warehousing or cross-docking function. as online orders may consist of different products, composing the orders from different warehouse locations may prove to be difficult and inefficient in terms of cost and delivery time. a central warehouse and fulfillment center may therefore, at a first view, be more adapted to the online channel. however, multi-channel retailers may as well pick the items for an online order directly in the stores. for an online order, the retailer has some flexibility where from he delivers the products to his customers, as he can use multiple stock locations and therefore offer a wider product range than the one contained in a single warehouse, as multiple channels may share their hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  9  inventories. in-store inventories can therefore be available for online customers' orders (agatz et al, 2008). centralizing stock allows easier monitoring of the stock levels for different products. if a retailer is serving its online clients (totally or partially) from stock in the stores, the overall stock level on these different locations is difficult to monitor. this is the same problem for multi-channel retailers who offer the possibility to their customers to order online and withdraw the product in a nearby store. as information on product availability is a crucial parameter for the customers buying decision, the accuracy of the stock level information is very important. order taking and fulfillment in an online channel, the customer enters the type and number of products he wants to acquire and enters the payment information (usually done by credit cards), the online channel therefore becomes a self-service channel (falk et al, 2007). all this information entered by the customer triggers the order preparation and fulfillment process. retailers once delivering their stores from centralized distribution centers (often with complete boxes or pallets) have to re-think the way orders are prepared, as their organizations are not designed for small individual customers' orders. they must therefore be reorganized to treat these orders (de koster, 2002), implementing a process of single item picking and packing. as mentioned above, another option for the retailer is to pick the items in the stores, where the products are available on the shelves, and to prepare the order in the shops. furthermore, orders may be consolidated from multiple stock locations (for example from a warehouse and a store), which needs a specific process. the more complex the fulfilment process is organized, the more difficult it becomes to respect the quality and efficiency of this process. delivery to the customer besides the availability of the product, the different delivery options for a product are an important parameter for the online channel client. different delivery service levels offered like delivery in 24 hours, delivery to a pick-up point, national post service etc. are becoming a product differentiation factor of the retailer. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  10  delivery to the customers' homes, which is a distinctive element of an online channel, implies to deal with cost and organizational issues. the usually small transactions have to be managed and delivered in an efficient way, while respecting the promised delivery timing. the costs of the home delivery can be totally or partially paid by the customer. this becomes an important parameter of choice for the client, as no direct delivery costs appear in the store channel. on the other hand, the costs of delivery can be used as a marketing tool for special offers (\\\"your next order free of charge\\\") or minimum order amounts (\\\"delivery free of charge for every order above 100 euros\\\"). delivery becomes therefore a service parameter, a price parameter and a promotional parameter. reverse logistic store customers can usually see, touch and try the goods before purchasing. returns are limited and very often linked to an exchange of the product, where the returned product is put back into the shelves. defect products are reimbursed. as online customers cannot see, touch and try the products, online retailers usually offer good conditions for the customer to return the products they don't like (due to legal and regulatory obligations, but as well as part of their customer service offer).  return handling must be quick in the eyes of the customers, either to get a product exchange or to get reimbursed and the customer account re-credited. the process must as well be efficient as it is a very manual process and impacts the stock management of the returned products (min et al, 2006). a physical store channel can be an easy way in the customer's eyes to return the products. multi-channel fulfillment systems  to operate the multi-channel strategy, retailers have to set up a fulfillment system to deliver products to the customers. this fulfillment system, organizing the process from order intake to delivery to the customer, has to match the business model and to reply to the operational challenges. industry players are using different fulfillment systems, and several authors suggest typologies of fulfillment schemes, focusing on the locus of order preparation (de koster, 2002; durand, 2008). multi-channel retailing per se intends to offer the clients the choice where and how to order and where and how to get the products delivered. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  11  the major choice for the client is to shop in the store or shop online. if shopping online, the client can furthermore opt for delivery at home or pick up his products in one of the retailer's stores.  the retailer has to set up a fulfillment system able to respect the client's choice of the delivery mode, either by creating a new logistics infrastructure, or using the existing one, by adapting the existing processes. in order to be able to analyze the fulfillment systems from a customer expectation's perspective, we decided to distinguish the fulfillment systems by the delivery option chosen by the customer: clients may either choose the direct home delivery for their purchases completed on the online channel or choose to pick up their purchased items in a physical store of the retailer. this in-store pick-up is a delivery option only multi-channel retailers can offer and which may be chosen to 30-40% of the customers at some multi-channel retailers (berman & thelen, 2004). a client going into a store in order to buy a product, searches, compares, picks the product out of the shelve and pays the product. single-channel store shoppers may therefore not be affected by the multi-channel fulfillment organization. 1. direct home delivery direct home delivery can be completed either by the retailer's own delivery organization, a delivery logistics provider or via an external pick-up point network3. before entering in this 'delivery pipeline', products have to be picked, prepared, packed and expedited, which can be done either in a central warehouse or distribution center, in a store, or in multiple locations (central warehouse and one or more stores).                                                   3 we consider a delivery via an external pick-up-point network (usually neighborhood shops linked to a network which offers the retreat of parcels for the clients of different retailers) like a home delivery, as the fulfillment process is quite identical, with a delivery of (sometimes pre-sorted) parcels to the pick-up point network's injection hub. although this is influencing the ease of access, this way of delivery cannot provide a contact with the retailer as in his own store.  hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  12  1.1 direct delivery from central warehouse  picking, preparation and packing of ordered items can be done from a central warehouse stocking the products (figure 1.1). this central warehouse can either be a purpose-built entity to serve exclusively the online channel or the existing warehouse for the store operations (in which case the processes in the warehouse have to be adapted).  1.2 direct delivery from a store  picking, preparation and packing of the ordered items can be done inside a physical store out of the shelves. in this case, operators pick the products into a specific order preparation cart from the shelves and then pack and send the completed order to the customer (figure 1.2).   1.3 direct delivery after multi-stock consolidation  if the desired articles of an order are not available in one place, picking of the ordered items has to be done in a central warehouse as well as inside a physical store from the shelves. the picked items have then to be consolidated, prepared and packed in one site (figure 1.3). in some cases, the multichannel  figure 1.1: direct delivery from central warehouse figure 1.2: direct delivery from a store figure 1.3: direct delivery after multi-stock consolidation hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  13  retailer may opt for sending the order in two different parcels, to avoid the costs and delay of the consolidation.  2 client pick-up in the store a customer ordering online may choose to pick up his products in one of the retailer's stores. in this case, products have to be picked, prepared, packed and kept ready for pick-up in the store. 2.1 direct in-store order preparation  if all the products of the customer's order are available in the store chosen by the customer to pick-up, the picking, preparation and packing of the order can be done immediately in the store (figure 2.1).     2.2 in-store order consolidation from multiple stocks  if some of the products of the customer's order are not available in the store chosen by the customer for pick-up, the unavailable items must be ordered from the central warehouse (or other stores) to complete the order. the preparation and packing of the order can be done only after consolidation of all items in the store (figure 2.2). (a specific case of this in-store order consolidation can be a complete order  preparation in a central warehouse sent to the store only to be picked up by the customer, without further adding any product in the store).  figure 2.1: direct in-store order-preparation figure 2.2: in-store order consolidation from multiple stocks hal-00560956, version 1 -

31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  15  \\u2010  delivery cost efficiency (indicating the total cost of delivery from the stock(s) to the customers' home or to the desired store for pick-up) \\u2010  channel organization efficiency (indicating the information exchange between sales channels and real time availability of data) \\u2010  fulfillment infrastructure costs (indicating the necessary investments, rents or outsourcing costs for the fulfillment infrastructure) \\u2010  return handling efficiency (indicating the speed and quality of the return handling process, from product reception to exchange or reimbursement for the client)  analysis in the first part of this paper suggests three parameters indicating the customer expectations: \\u2010  product availability (indicating the availability of the desired products) \\u2010  speed of delivery (indicating the time between the order placement and the reception of the products by the customers) \\u2010  ease of access and return of products (indicating the ease for a client either to get the products delivered/to pick them up or to return/exchange the products received) in order to assess more precisely how a fulfillment system corresponds to the customer expectations, we completed these parameters with parameters from the servqual framework, developed by parasuraman et al (1988) to measure service quality. nevertheless, this traditional service quality may not be applicable in an online environment (parasuraman et al, 2005). bressolles (2006) developed the netqual framework to specifically assess electronic service quality.  as multi-channel retailing provides both 'traditional' and 'online' service experiences, we have to combine these two approaches in order to identify all the relevant dimensions to customer expectations and retain only those which may be directly impacted by the fulfilment model.  therefore, we selected the following dimensions out of the servqual and netqual scales for our analysis: \\u2010  quality and quantity of information ( netqual) (indicating the availability and correctness of the information provided in terms of product availability, stock level, delivery times etc. either on the website or in the stores)  hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  16  \\u2010  reliability and respect of commitments (servqual & netqual) (indicating the ability to deliver the products in terms of quantity, price, description and timing) \\u2010  offer (netqual) (indicating the lengths and the width of the product range available on the different channels) \\u2010  assurance (servqual) (indicating the competence and friendliness of the personnel usually in the store for buying, pick-up and exchange transactions of the client).  we did not retain those dimensions having only an indirect link with the fulfillment systems. these elements constitute the analysis framework we propose to analyze the overall performance of specific fulfillment systems. application of the analysis framework  we are now able to apply this proposed framework to the five identified fulfillment systems according to our objective to evaluate the fit between a multi-channel retailer's business model and a specific fulfillment system. to be able to analyze each of the abovementioned fulfillment systems, we will explore the sensitivity of each of the parameters regarding the main characteristics of the different fulfillment systems.4 we apply numerical scores to each parameter, depending if the efficiency of this parameter is high (2), medium (1) or low (0). this qualitative evaluation, based on the discussion of the different elements of the retail mix and the operational challenges, aims to compare the relative efficiency of one parameter in different fulfillment systems. we do not intend to provide an absolute performance test. quality and quantity of information customers expect correct information, especially on pricing and delivery costs of the different channels, but as well on other parameters like product availability, speed of delivery and product characteristics. the retailer's challenge is always to have the right information available on every channel.                                                  4 each of the above identified parameters expressing customer expectations and economic performance of a specific fulfillment system has multiple implications on other parameters. it is to retain that these parameters may be interdependent (e.g. the width of the product offer impacts the product availability, the picking efficiency and the fulfillment infrastructure costs).  hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  17  using a centralized stock provides the highest chance to have the right information available (score: 2), whereas an order preparation from stores induces the problem of obtaining the right information on the store stock level (score: 1). if the order preparation has to be completed on several stock locations (central warehouse and stores), it is very difficult to obtain correct information and the quality of information may be low (score: 0). reliability and respect of commitments customers expect retailers to keep their promises, especially in terms of delivery time and delivery service. central warehouse order preparation should facilitate this, as the quality of information is high and the fulfillment process can be optimized (score: 2). order preparation in the stores suffers from difficulties in keeping a real-time stock level of all the products. therefore, store preparation may guarantee only a medium level of reliability and respect of commitments (score: 1), whereas multi-stock order preparation may only provide a low level (score: 0).  offer customers expect to find the offer they expect on every channel, a large or narrow product range with the appropriate depth of assortment. the retailer has to make sure to be able to offer the products customers expect on every channel. order fulfillment at a central warehouse or from multiple stocks should be capable to provide the entire range of the products (both score: 2), order preparation at the store is limited to the only product assortment in stock at the store (score: 0). product availability the customer expects that the products he intends to buy are available in the channel he desires to use. a central warehouse order preparation may provide only a medium level of product availability (score: 1) compared to the other options, as the availability depends on the stock keeping and forecasting precision of this single warehouse. stores can only guarantee a low level of product availability because of the small number of stock for every referenced product and the continuous buying from customers in the store (score: 0).  multi-stock order preparation may use the stock of different entities (stores and central warehouse) and therefore guarantee a very high level of product availability (score: 2), especially in case of a high number of articles per customer order. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  18  speed of delivery customers usually expect a rapid delivery of the products they bought and to be informed about the delivery timing. retailers therefore have to implement a fast and reliable delivery process, which may imply an external delivery service provider. a central warehouse usually needs to bridge the distance to the final customer, which may be long and therefore time-consuming. a medium level of speed of delivery may therefore be guaranteed (score: 1). as stores are closer to the final customer, the speed of delivery can be high when orders are prepared in the store (score: 2). orders prepared from multiple stock locations need a long time to be consolidated and can therefore only provide a low relative delivery speed (score: 0). ease of access and return of products customers expect easy access to the retailer to either pick up the products ordered or to return or exchange a product in case of dissatisfaction. home delivery from a central warehouse may make returns and exchange difficult for customers (score: 0), who have to use a postal service for returning the products (except in the case the retailer owns a quite dense network of stores and the store channel is fully integrated to handle returns and exchange from the online channel). order preparation in the store is usually done in the store closest to the customer. this store is therefore easy to access for the customer (score: 2). multi-stock preparation can only provide a medium level of ease of access and return (score: 1). although the customer can return a product to the closest store, exchange can be impossible if the products to be exchanged are only available at another stock location. assurance the customers expect competent and friendly personnel in the store for buying, picking up their orders, return or exchange. the same expectation may apply for the personnel on telephone customer hotlines or the delivery personnel. these functions being very often outsourced (especially the latter), retailers have to focus on their own sales personnel and make sure they provide the level of assurance the customer is expecting by providing the same information to all channels. the assurance of the personnel can only be provided in the case of order pick-up of the customer in the stores (score: 2; other option scores: 0). hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  19  stock efficiency for the retailer, the efficiency of stock management is crucial for numerous reasons. stock keeping and monitoring of stock levels, balancing between different stock locations and the forecasting of sales and product reorders influence the availability of the products and therefore the sales. efficient stock handling is as well an important cost element. central stock management can provide a high level of efficiency (score: 2), whereas a store can only provide a medium efficiency (score: 1) because of the low number of products per article and the continuous stock movement due to customers purchases out of the shelves. the handling of multiple stocks in the fulfillment process is the least efficient (score: 0). picking efficiency the picking of products out of stock to prepare the customer's order is the key process of the overall fulfillment process, representing a very important part of the warehouse operating costs. this process is nevertheless transparent to the customer. a central warehouse can be organized in a way to optimize the picking process by planning and reducing the way picking operators have to go during the process (score: 2). depending on the volumes and the type of articles, it is possible to split the stock for whole cartons or open cartons picking or separate zones for stocking and picking. this optimization cannot be provided in a store or in multiple stock sites (scores: 0). stores' layouts and product locations are planned to make the customer spend the maximum time in the store and not to optimize the picking (de koster, 2002). delivery cost efficiency customers expect to pay the lowest extra cost possible for the delivery of their online orders and the retailer has to reduce the overall cost of the delivery. delivery of orders prepared in a central warehouse has always to include the transport to the customer's home and therefore only achieve a medium efficiency (score: 1) compared to the delivery from a store (score: 2), where the distance to the final customer is short. pick-up by the customer from the store where the order was prepared is the less costly way of delivery for the retailer. any delivery from an order prepared in multiple stock locations (for home delivery or to a store for pick-up) is least efficient (score: 0), as the consolidation process of the order implies multiple costs of handling and transportation. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  20  channel organization efficiency as stated above, customers want to be able to use different channels simultaneously. a retailer has therefore to manage all the channels in an integrated manner.  preparing orders for home delivery from a central warehouse is the simplest and most efficient organization (score: 2). order preparation in the store involves the online and the store channel in the fulfillment process, therefore adding a level of complexity (score: 1). multi-stock preparation adds further complexity, being therefore the most difficult solution to achieve an efficient channel organization (score: 0). fulfillment infrastructure costs the fulfillment process may generate important investment costs, when a specific site is built as the stock and the distribution center, or if the design and the organization of an existing facility have to be modified. renting or outsourcing this infrastructure generates additional costs as well. a central warehouse order preparation generates a high infrastructure cost (score: 0), whereas the store preparation generates the lowest additional infrastructure costs (score: 2). order preparation from multiple stocks may generate medium additional infrastructure costs (score: 1) to organize the consolidation of the orders. return handling efficiency customers expect their returns to be processed quickly, to receive an exchange product or to get reimbursed the purchasing price. the retailer must therefore provide a quick and efficient return handling process. a central warehouse enables creation of optimized return processing (score: 2) to check the returns, repack and restock them and send the exchange items to the customers. multi-stock fulfillment can only provide a lower rate of return efficiency (score: 1), as the returned items arrive in different locations and the exchange items may only be available on different stock locations. for a store it is very difficult to offer an optimized return process (score: 0), especially when returned products are not part of the store's product offer.  we can therefore summarize the impacts of the different fulfillment systems on the different parameters as follows (figure 3):  hal-00560956, version 1 -

home delivery from a central warehouse (system 1.1) is the fulfillment system best meeting the combination of the two dimensions customer expectations and economic performance, providing a total score of 16. this system provides the highest score in economic performance (9) and the second highest score in customer expectations (7). - customer pick-up after preparation in the store (system 2.1) provides the highest score in customer expectation (8) and a medium score in economic performance (6). the overall performance of this system is second best (total score of 14). - home delivery after store preparation (system 1.2) provides medium scores in customer expectations (6) and economic performance (6), ranking third best in the overall score (12).  - any fulfillment system implying the order preparation out of multiple stocks appears to be less efficient: if the order is picked up by the customer (system 2.2), the total score is 9, if the hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  22  order is delivered at home (system 1.3), the total score is only 7. in terms of economic performance, these two systems provide the lowest score (2). - economic performances of order preparation in the store or from multiple stocks are identical for both home delivery or in-store pick up by the customer. the difference in customer expectations (difference of 2) results from the possibility to have a personal contact with the customer, therefore responding to the customer expectation of 'assurance', which can only be provided in a store. discussion, managerial implications and research avenues  the qualitative analysis of the different fulfillment systems and their impact on customer expectations and economic performance reveals that different fulfillment systems can provide high overall performance levels in terms of customer expectations and economic performance. the framework shows that orders for home delivery prepared in a central warehouse present only a slightly higher overall performance than an order prepared in a store for customer store-pick-up. a retailer has to assess the importance of each of the analyzed parameters for his specific retail mix and to optimize the trade-offs between channel fulfillment synergies and specific needs on different channels. depending on the product mix between food and non-food products, the width of product assortment and the characteristics of the existing store network, specific solutions may be more appropriate than others to fit with a specific business model. whereas proximity to customers is best achieved through a store network, stores add complexity on different levels in the fulfillment process which affect timing, costs and reliability. multi-stock consolidation seems to be always by far the less efficient model, regarding the customer expectations and the economic performance. this corresponds to the three initially mentioned multi-channel retailers: fnac abandoned the multi-stock preparation and completely integrated their fulfillment for the different channels, and neither tesco nor monoprix apply a multi-stock solution, whilst optimizing the in-store order preparation. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  23  our proposed framework could prove useful for multi-channel retailers in various ways: it provides a tool to evaluate the chosen fulfillment system and therefore identifying improvement potentials on specific parameters. it could also provide helpful to measure customer satisfaction. moreover, it should clearly be useful in anticipating the needs for fulfillment systems when planning to implement a multi-channel strategy. the proposed qualitative framework should be further validated by conducting supplementary empirical analysis, although it may be difficult to compare economic performances and customer expectations of different fulfillment systems in a same company. another difficulty may be to isolate the impacts of the supply chain from other impacts (marketing, pricing, product policy etc.). a limitation of our framework is the fact that it does not assess the interdependencies between the different dependent parameters, but only focuses on one major impact at a time. a first step to further back this framework could be to conduct a dynamic analysis through a simulation, testing values for the different parameters of the analysis framework. research could aim to find evidence if there is an 'optimum' fulfillment system for every multi-channel retailer. such an optimal model could be defined depending on different independent variables like product assortment, average number of items per shopping basket, value of products, product characteristics, degree of channel integration etc. this would also include an analysis of the trade-off between cost- and customer service level optimization. such a research could as well reveal that there is no optimum model, but just a set of independent and non stabilized models evolving quickly as the retailers' strategy mix evolves.   acknowledgement  the work on this paper was partially supported by the innovation and regulation chair of orange, ecole polytechnique, telecom paris. hal-00560956, version 1 -

      "        \"abstract\": \"The traditional retail environment, which is characterized by a clear division between brick-and-mortar and non-brick-and-mortar retail channels, has been recently disrupted by developments in e-commerce and mobile technologies. The result has been the emergence of omni-channel retailing. Within the reality of this new retail environment, it has been proposed that retailers should develop the necessary capabilities to fulfill consumer demand from anywhere \\u2013 the store, the distribution center, or via drop-shipping from a supplier \\u2013 which leads to the emergence of new operational complexities and challenges in the retail supply chain. In light of the growing popularity of these new fulfillment capabilities, it is important to not only consider the financial returns they provide to retailers, but also the potential impacts on the upstream supply chain. Moreover, omni-channel operations will allow retailers to offer new fulfillment services to consumers, such as cross-channel returns or in-store pick-ups, ultimately resulting in new supply chain service outputs in the consumer market.

recently disrupted by developments in e-commerce and mobile technologies. the result has been the emergence of omni-channel retailing. within the reality of this new retail environment, it has been proposed that retailers should develop the necessary capabilities to fulfill consumer demand from anywhere \\u2013 the store, the distribution center, or via drop-shipping from a supplier \\u2013 which leads to the emergence of new operational complexities and challenges in the retail supply chain. in light of the growing popularity of these new fulfillment capabilities, it is important to not only consider the financial returns they provide to retailers, but also the potential impacts on the upstream supply chain. moreover, omni-channel operations will allow retailers to offer new fulfillment services to consumers, such as cross-channel returns or in-store pick-ups, ultimately resulting in new supply chain service outputs in the consumer market. thus, the aim of this dissertation is to investigate and obtain a holistic understanding of the importance and impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations for successful retail supply chain management. this will be done by considering three different echelons in the supply chain, (retailer, supplier, and consumer), and investigating how emerging strategies in omni-channel fulfillment impact all three. using the theoretical underpinning of ambidexterity, essay 1 investigates how retailers manage their investments and developments pertaining to existing and new fulfillment operations, and how that may lead to improvements in a retailer's operational and financial performance. to address this research question a structured content analysis in combination with secondary financial data was conducted. to explore how retail omni-channel fulfillment operations impact upstream supply chain members a qualitative research approach was executed in essay 2 using the case study methodology. essay 3 employs a

characterized by a clear division between brick-and-mortar and non-brick-and-mortar retailers, experienced a recent shift by the emergence of e-commerce and mobile technologies (brynjolfsson, hu, and rahman 2013; rigby 2011). in this new retail environment, the clear division between physical and digital retail channels has been slowly diminishing. now, a new integrated omni-channel retail environment (brynjolfsson et al. 2013) with multiple touch-points (wallace et al. 2004) and innovative services, such as in-store pick up (vishwanath and mulvin 2001) and the ability to return online purchases at a physical store is emerging (bendoly et al. 2005). however, retailers offering consumers with these innovative fulfillment services spanning multiple channels are likely to also face difficulties and challenges in managing and executing their retail supply chain operations in an efficient and effective manner. while some retailers, such as nordstrom, apple, or walmart for instance, excel with their omni-channel fulfillment operations, the reality is that the majority of retailers struggle with the realization and management of their omni-channel fulfillment operations (forrester research, inc. 2014). omni-channel fulfillment operations are those activities that span from consumers placing orders from multiple touch points (i.e. store, website, mobile device) to retailers fulfilling those orders from multiple touch points (i.e. store, dc, or manufacturer), ultimately resulting in customer satisfaction (pyke et al. 2001; strang 2013). research suggests that retailers with effective omni-channel retail service operations management are able to gain a competitive advantage (burke 2002; weinberg et al. 2007). however, the majority of the research on retail operations focuses on investigating operations within a single channel, neglecting the emerging operational complexity of omni-channel retailing (agatz et al. 2008). 2  thus, important and interesting research questions pertaining to omni-channel fulfillment operations are still unanswered and warrant further exploration.   apple, for example, became a leading omni-channel retailer by taking advantage of its already established fulfillment operations of its brick-and-mortar and online channel through integrating the respective channel operations to develop and establish new fulfillment operations opportunities. this anecdotal evidence of apple advocates the importance of adopting new fulfillment operations for retailers to be successful within the new reality of omni-channel retailing. it is proposed that retailers developing the necessary capabilities to fulfill consumer demand from anywhere \\u2013 the store, the distribution center, or via drop-shipping from a supplier (strang 2013) \\u2013 is leading to the emergence of new operational complexities and challenges in the retail supply chain.  while these new fulfillment operations enable retailers to offer new services to consumers, such as cross-channel returns or in-store pick-ups (vishwanath and mulvin 2001), they might also have significant impacts on the upstream supply chain as well. however, current research falls short in terms of considering the potential impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations on different echelons in the supply chain. thus, the aim of this dissertation is to investigate and obtain a more holistic understanding of the importance and impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations for successful retail supply chain management by considering three different echelons in the supply chain. three individual studies implementing various methodological approaches were conducted that considered the potential impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations at the supplier, the retailer, and the consumer level. figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the three essays. the following research questions are addressed in this dissertation: 3  (1) how do retail omni-channel fulfillment operations impact retail firm performance? (2) how do retail omni-channel fulfillment operations impact the upstream supply chain? (3) how do retail omni-channel fulfillment operations impact consumer service perceptions?  figure 1: dissertation overview foundational literature review retail supply chain management retail supply chain management research spans across a wide range of specific research areas, but predominantly focuses on investigating the potential impacts of operational improvements on retail supply chain performance (mentzer et al. 2000). over the last decade more retail research emerged focusing on the strategic importance of the retailer (randall et al. 2011) and even consumers in retail supply chain management (e.g. rao et al. 2014; rao et al. 4  2011). extant literature can be broadly categorized into three areas that address: forecasting, inventory management and the bullwhip effect, and retail operations. forecasting literature exploring forecasting in supply chain management can be segmented into three literature streams. the first stream focuses on how forecasting accuracy can be improved (e.g. williams and waller 2010; williams and waller 2011). for example, research in this stream suggests that suppliers may be able to improve their forecast accuracy by using point-of-sale data rather than using a retailer's order history to develop forecasts (williams and waller 2010; williams and waller 2011). the second stream explores how forecasting impacts operational performance (e.g. aviv 2007). for instance, it is suggested that suppliers and buyers can achieve significant supply chain performance improvements when implementing a collaborative forecasting approach in comparison to each echelon developing an individual forecast (e.g. aviv 2001; cachon and lariviere 2001). the third stream of research integrates the importance of managerial decision making into forecasting accuracy (carbone and gorr 1985; kremer et al. 2011). this body of work suggests that human judgment is an important factor that should be considered when developing forecasts. for example, kremer et al. (2011) showed that managers are likely to overreact to forecast errors in stable environments leading to poorer forecasting performance.  inventory management and bullwhip effect another body of literature within the area of retail supply chain management considers inventory management and the bullwhip effect. the bullwhip effect is the amplified variability in demand as one moves upstream in the supply chain (lee et al. 1997). within that literature, 5  research primarily focuses on exploring the impact of inaccurate inventory records (e.g. dehoratius and raman 2008; kull et al. 2013) and the operational and behavioral causes of the bullwhip effect (e.g. lee et al. 1997; croson and donohue 2006). in general, research has shown that inventory record inaccuracy leads to poor retail performance. specifically, within a multi-channel retail setting, daily inventory record inaccuracy has been shown to increase inventory levels, while simultaneously decreasing service levels (kull et al. 2013). similarly, nachtmann et al. (2010) found evidence for lower service levels stemming from inaccurate inventory records. pertaining to the bullwhip effect, early research was specifically interested in exploring the operational causes that lead to the bullwhip effect (e.g. sterman 1989; lee et al. 1997). in addition to operational causes, behavioral causes, such as decision biases, have been of interest to retail supply chain management research. for example, croson and donohue (2006) found that managers constantly underweight the supply line (i.e. failure to account for past orders) inducing the bullwhip effect even after controlling for operational causes. however, some researchers failed to find evidence that the bullwhip effect  exists in retail supply chains (cachon et al. 2007).  retail operations a last major topic in retail supply chain management considers retail operations and specifically focuses on on-shelf availability (osa) (e.g. dehoratius and raman 2008; waller et al. 2010; ehrenthal and st\\u00f6lzle 2013). within this research domain two streams can be identified. the first stream emphasizes the causes of poor osa (e.g. ehrenthal and st\\u00f6lzle 2013; ettouzani et al. 2012) whereas the second stream focuses on consumer responses to out-of-stocks (zinn and liu 2001; zinn and liu 2008; peinkofer et al. 2015). this research 6  suggests that poor osa is primarily the result of operational inefficiencies within the supply chain (corsten and gruen 2003). furthermore, while poor osa leads to significant financial losses for retailers and suppliers, it also impacts consumers. the literature suggests that stockouts lead to consumer dissatisfaction and lowers repurchase intentions (pizzi and scarpi 2013; kim and lennon 2011). fulfillment operations research pertaining to omni-channel fulfillment operations is still in its infancy and the majority of the available papers are either analytical in nature or adopt simulation techniques. this body of literature primarily focuses on investigating the linkages between fulfillment operations and the potential cost trade-offs firms may face when implementing omni-channel fulfillment operations (e.g. bretthauer et al. 2010; alptekino\\u011flu and tang 2005).  while these important contributions should not be overlooked, the current focus of the extant research effectively ignores the impact that omni-channel fulfillment operations may have on supply chain members. thus, it might be necessary to gain a holistic understanding of the potential impacts, changes, and challenges by considering different echelons of the supply chain. within the realm of omni-channel retailing, operating and integrating multiple channels adds to a supply chain's complexity but also provides members of a supply chain with new service opportunities and synergies (verhoef et al. 2012). this is particularly relevant within the context of fulfillment operations. for example, some companies now offer consumers the ability to order products online and pick them up in the store, or request they be delivered to their home or place of employment. given this change in the consumer environment, retailers will need to develop the capabilities required to fulfill consumer orders that are received and 7  satisfied simply from anywhere - whether it is from the store, the warehouse, or directly the supplier (strang 2013).   one common theme found across the fulfillment literature pertains to the different strategies that multi-channel retailers use. typically, retailers adding an additional  retail channel can either select to establish a separate fulfillment network or they can leverage their already existing  network (bendoly 2004). in the latter case, retailers could use their stores to also fulfill online demand. however, research shows that retailers should carefully evaluate based on various factors, such as that the percentage of online sales (bretthauer et al. 2010) for example, which stores to dedicate for simultaneous in store and online demand fulfillment since not all stores may be appropriate for online fulfillment operations (e.g. bretthauer et al. 2010; bendoly 2004; mahar et al. 2014). another possible option for retailers is to fulfill online demand using a distribution center. insofar as distribution cost might differ for each of these options, alptekino\\u011flu and tang (2005) develop a model and demonstrate that it is typically more beneficial to fulfill online demand from the store when the distribution costs for both options similar. a second stream of research pertaining to fulfillment operations focuses on the impact of drop-shipping in online retailing. drop-shipping is a fulfillment strategy where online orders are directly fulfilled by suppliers rather than drawing inventory from a retailer's physical store or a distribution center (cheong et al. 2015). one major challenge associated with this fulfillment option has to do with the potential discrepancies in inventory information between retailers and drop-shippers. inventory record inaccuracies are a major driver of retail operation inefficiencies (kull et al. 2013; dehoratius and raman 2008). however, research shows that 8  these challenges can be mitigated by commitment-penalty contracts (gan et al. 2010) or by accounting for potential inventory errors (cheong et al. 2015). theoretical background essays one and two focus on the firm level; hence, an organizational theory is a suitable lens to inform these essays. insofar as it is important for suppliers and retailers to refine their current fulfillment operations while simultaneously developing new fulfillment operations to adapt to the changing environment, the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity is deemed appropriate for these two studies. essay three focuses on consumers more specifically and thus warrants a consumer level theory. since equity theory has been widely used to study consumer behavior and perceptions in the context of service recovery (e.g. roggeveen et al. 2012), equity theory is suitable to explore how omni-channel fulfillment operations impact consumer service perceptions.  ambidexterity rothaermel and alexandre (2009, 759) define ambidexterity as \\\"an individual's ability to use both hands with equal ease\\\". applied to organizational management research, the ambidexterity concept has received interest from management scholars over the last decade (o'reilly and tushman 2013) and have given rise to a new research paradigm in the organizational theory literature (raisch and birkinshaw 2008). research suggests that specifically within dynamic environments successful firms are understood to be ambidextrous (junni et al. 2013) when they are capable of meeting current demand while at the same time being able to adapt to environmental (and subsequent demand) changes (duncan 1976; gibson and birkinshaw 2004; tushman and o'reilly 1996).  9  the concept of ambidexterity has been examined across various disciplines and contexts, such as organizational learning (e.g. march 1991; katila and ahuja 2002), innovation (e.g. tushman and o'reilly 1996; he and wong 2004), and most recently, operations management (e.g. blome et al. 2013; kristal et al. 2010). ambidexterity originated in the organizational learning literature (march 1991) and implies that in order to be successful, firms should meet current business demands (exploitation) while simultaneously adapting to environmental changes (exploration) (duncan 1976; gibson and birkinshaw 2004; tushman and o'reilly 1996). according to march (1991, 71) exploitation is defined as a firm's activities that are characterized by, for example, refinement, efficiency, implementation, and execution, whereas exploitation is understood as a firm's activities that include risk taking, experimentation, flexibility, discovery, and innovation to name a few.  while earlier research proposes that it is impossible for firms to achieve a simultaneous balance between exploitation and exploration (hannan and freeman 1977), march (1991) argues the contrary. march claims that it is of explicit necessity to a company's survival that a balance between exploitation and exploration is maintained. focusing on only one activity, either exploitation or exploration, may actually be to a company's disadvantage. literature suggests that companies solely focusing on exploitation may find themselves in a competency trap since these companies are unlikely to have the necessary capabilities in place to respond to environmental changes (levitt and march 1988). similarly, companies solely focusing on exploration may find themselves in a reiterative circle of search without any long-lasting outcomes (levinthal and march 1993). therefore the organizational research focus shifted from considering trade-offs between competing organizational activities, to adopting the 10  paradoxical view of aligning competing organizational activities simultaneously, thus giving rise to the concept of ambidexterity in management research (o'reilly and tushman 2013). operations and supply chain scholars recognize ambidexterity as a potential solution to overcome the trade-offs between operational efficiency and adaptability (e.g. kristal et al. 2010; patel et al. 2012). within the limited number of research manuscripts addressing ambidexterity three themes can be distinguished. first, some scholars use ambidexterity within the broader context of supply chain management (kristal et al. 2010; chandrasekaran et al. 2012). for example, kristal et al. (2010) showed that firms having an ambidextrous supply chain strategy is helpful in developing supply chain capabilities and competencies leading to increased firm performance. a second theme considers ambidexterity at an operational level. research suggest that operational ambidexterity is specifically important for companies operating under high uncertainty (patel et al. 2012). while the first two themes consider ambidexterity within an individual firm, the third theme investigates the potential impact of ambidexterity when spanning firm boundaries. research especially focused on how ambidextrous governance relates to firm performance (blome et al.  2013; chiu 2014). findings suggest that within supply chain management, contractual and relational partnerships should be viewed as complementary rather than trade-offs (blome et al. 2013).  equity theory equity theory (adams 1965) is an appropriate theoretical lens to study retail phenomena involving retailers and consumers. equity theory states that in an exchange relationship, one party will experience a feeling of injustice if their ratio of outcomes to inputs is perceivably lower than their exchange partner's ratio of outcomes to inputs. for example, if a retailer and its consumers are in an exchange relationship and the retailer is unable to provide 11  the consumers with the products they desire, consumers are likely to experience inequity and dissatisfaction (oliver 1980) since they expected to be able to buy the product. however, equity can be restored by altering either the consumer's inputs or outputs. for example, a retailer may offer customers a similar product (to the one they are out of), which in turn may increase the consumer's output, thereby mitigating the feeling of injustice leading to consumer satisfaction (roggeveen et al. 2012) and a positive attitude (oliver 1980).   while equity theory originally only considered the dimension of distributive justice, more recently it has been conceptualized by three dimensions: distributive, procedural, and interactional justice. distributive justice refers to an individual's perception that the outcome of a process was fair (adams 1965; tax et al. 1998). procedural justice refers to an individual's perception of whether the process and policies that led to the outcome of process are were fair (lind and tyler 1988; blodgett et al. 1997), and interactional justice refers to an individual's perception of whether the interpersonal treatment during the process was fair (tax et al. 1998).  service recovery literature specifically draws on equity theory and conceptualizes equity as consisting of the three aforementioned dimensions. extant research has shown that all three justice dimensions are important when attempting to restore consumer satisfaction after a service failure has occurred (e.g. roggeveen et al. 2012). additionally, supply chain management researchers have used equity theory to investigate supply chain failures (rao et al. 2011; griffis et al. 2012). therefore, the use of equity theory to study how omni-channel fulfillment operations impact consumer service perceptions is appropriate.    12  structure of the dissertation three individual essays with different methodological approaches were conducted to address the research questions outlined in the introduction. essay one addresses the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations at the retailer level using secondary data. essay two investigates the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations on upstream supply chain members. for this study a qualitative approach is used. lastly, essay three focuses on the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations at the consumer level by implementing a series of experimental studies. essay one using the theoretical underpinning of ambidexterity, this essay explores how retailers manage and prioritize their investments and developments pertaining to exploratory and exploitative fulfillment operations and how those may lead to improvements in a retailer's operational and financial performance. to address how omni-channel fulfillment operations are related to retail firm performance, a combination of secondary data of the retail industry are used. using secondary data overcomes several shortcomings of other methods, for example survey methods, which are associated with common method and key informant bias (roth 2007; gattiker and parente 2007). data was collected from various secondary data sources. first, compustat data was used to collect firm-level financial measures for publicly traded retailers. second, press releases from the lexis-nexis database were used to collect data pertaining to a retailer's announcement of fulfillment operations. this approach is in line with prior research 13  implementing a similar research approach (e.g. hofer et al.  2012; uotila et al. 2009; tate et al. 2010).  the search within lexis-nexis is limited to the archives of the business wire and pr newswire and all press releases referring to a retailer's omni-channel fulfillment operations will be included in our analysis. once all press releases were collected, the archival texts were analyzed using atlas.ti to extract data to create our independent variables. structural content analysis is an appropriate tool for quantitative content analysis (tangpong 2011) and has been used in prior supply chain and operations research (e.g. hofer et al. 2012). this approach is in line with previous research using press releases and structural content analyses to construct the independent variables of interest (uotila et al. 2009).  essay two  a qualitative approach is suitable for exploration and theory building (charmaz 2006). to explore how a retailer's omni-channel fulfillment operations impact upstream supply chain members a qualitative research approach is employed using a case study design (yin 2009). by starting the research process with examining the potential impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations on upstream supply chain members in depth, a solid understanding of the underlying assumptions and processes is achieved. two case studies consisting of in-depth interviews and on-site visits were conducted. the emerging findings were triangulated with data from online news articles. this study explores the new role of suppliers within omni-channel retailing and how suppliers achieve operational ambidexterity. interviews were professionally transcribed and analyzed using initial and focused coding procedures following charmaz (2006). adopting a qualitative research approach resulted in a solid theoretical model deeply grounded in the data (charmaz 2006). 14  essay three the aim of this essay is to explore how omni-channel fulfillment operations can be used to recover from a stockout. this essay investigates how, in the case of a stockout, different attributes (e.g. convenience and speed) of omni-channel fulfillment operations may impact consumer satisfaction and their evaluation of a retailer's physical distribution service quality (pdsq). using equity theory, a conceptual framework was developed and a series of experimental studies conducted to address the aforementioned research question. experimental methods are used to isolate the causal effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable(s) of interest (tokar 2010) and to test for potential mediators and moderators (knemeyer and naylor 2011). to ensure that only the variables of interest are manipulated and to rule out potential confounds, this method involves the careful development of experimental manipulations through extensive pretesting (perdue and summers 1986; knemeyer and naylor 2011). the first study manipulated two attributes related to omni-channel fulfillment: convenience, which refers to where a product is shipped to (i.e. the store or the consumer's home) and speed, which accounts for when a product will be delivered (i.e. next day or in 9 days). building on the first study, the second study specifically investigated the underlying theoretical mechanism, which may led to restoration of positive consumer perceptions after a stockout occurred. study 3 introduced purchase criticality as an important contextual factor to investigate whether the relationships found in study 1 and study 2 holds in different consumer's shopping context. research on consumer responses to out-of-stocks has shown that it is important to consider whether a consumer feels he or she truly \\\"needs\\\" a product or not, since this contextual factor might alternate the expected relationships (zinn and liu 2001).  15  following prior experimental work in the supply chain management field (e.g. esper et al. 2003), the series of experiments is based on a hypothetical shopping scenario where only the variables of interest vary between treatment groups. careful development of the experimental shopping scenario, following the guidelines of rungtusanatham et al. (2011), ensured the validity of the shopping scenario. similarly, extensive pretesting ensured the validity of the experimental manipulations (perdue and summers 1986). the hypothetical shopping scenario asked participants to imagine themselves in a particular shopping situation and asked them to answer a short survey, wherein the responses served as the dependent variables of interest. for the pretest, a student sample was used. students are an acceptable sample for experimental research in supply chain management research (thomas 2011), insofar as students are also consumers (kardes 1996). the final data wwre collected via amazon mechanical turk (mturk), a national online consumer panel. mturk has been deemed an acceptable source to recruit participants for experimental research (knemeyer and naylor 2011; goodman et al. 2013).  contributions and implications  the current fulfillment operations literature primarily employs analytical models to investigate the impact of various fulfillment strategies on cost trade-offs. consequently, the extant literature provides only limited insights into the impact of fulfillment operations and neglects the potential effects on other important retail supply chain performance measures. this dissertation overcomes these limitations by exploring the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations on three different echelons in the supply chain. thus, this dissertation provides a holistic view of how omni-channel fulfillment operations affect retail operations and supply chain management, more generally. 16  contributions and implications of essay one essay one of this dissertation highlights the strategic importance of omni-channel fulfillment operations for retailers' performance outcomes. specifically, this research shows that retailers in the general merchandise and apparel segment achieve significant financial performance improvements due to operational ambidexterity. by focusing on the importance of developing ambidexterity in terms of fulfillment operations to achieve superior operational and financial performance outcomes, this dissertation explicates the impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations, beyond just a retailer's cost structure. this is of particular interest, insofar as some companies fail to report any performance enhancements despite conducting omni-channel fulfillment operations (pwc 2015). consequently, this research is able to explain why some companies experience superior performance outcomes due to omni-channel fulfillment operations and why others do not. such insights might enable mangers to evaluate their own companies and equip them with better understanding as to why their companies might not reach expected performance outcomes. it also highlights the importance for managers to develop ambidextrous fulfillment operations to succeed in the changing and volatile retail environment. moreover, by considering the impact of additional factors on the ambidexterity-performance relationship, this research explores boundary conditions and thus, also contributes to the theoretical understandings of ambidexterity. considering resource endowment as a potential moderator, this research shows that large as well as small retailers might benefit from developing ambidextrous fulfillment operations. managerially, the results inform mangers on whether, operational ambidexterity would be is a viable strategy to implement in order to achieve improved performance outcomes. 17  this research also contributes to the limited body of work on operational ambidexterity. ambidexterity is an important concept, which overcomes trade-offs that managers might experience in the operations management field. thus, this research provides further evidence of the positive relationship between operational ambidexterity and a firm's operational and financial performance. in particular, this research uses longitudinal data providing further insights into the impact of operational ambidexterity over time to overcome the limitations of the current research, which relies heavily on cross-sectional data (e.g. patel et al. 2012). furthermore, by constructing an innovative data set and using a structured content analysis, this research specifically follows recent calls for more innovate research approaches (boyer and swink 2008) and the usage of content analyses for operations management research in particular (tangpong 2011). accordingly, essay one contributes to the general operations management literature by illustrating the suitability of this methodological approach for this discipline.  contributions and implications of essay two essay two of this dissertation explores how suppliers become operationally ambidextrous. specifically, considering drop-shipping as a new fulfillment option, suppliers might experience a disruption in their already established fulfillment operations, insofar as they now might also fulfill individual end-consumer orders. this research focuses on suppliers' operational ambidexterity by providing a detailed description of how suppliers actually achieve operational ambidexterity within the context of drop-shipping. it is suggested that within the context of drop-shipping, there is a cyclical nature of exploitation and exploration. this is especially important considering that the literature lacks a clear understanding on how companies can achieve ambidexterity (e.g adler et al. 1999; siggelkow and levinthal 2003). 18  thus, this research advances the theoretical understandings of operational ambidexterity. this research also provides managers with insights on how to become operationally ambidextrous. supply chain managers can use the findings of this study to benchmark them against their own company to investigate the factors needing adjustment in order to improve their operational ambidexterity. in addition, this research shifts the focus of drop-shipping research from a strategic perspective (the retailer) to a more tactical perspective (the supplier). in response, this research provides insight into the operational challenges (customizing, complying, and coordinating) and drivers (reacting, accepting, and penetrating) suppliers are facing within the current context of omni-channel retailing. contributions and implications of essay three essay three spans the research areas of operations and marketing by investigating how omni-channel fulfillment operations can impact consumer perceptions. this research specifically contributes to the growing literature stream associated with consumer issues in supply chain management, which advocates the importance of operations management to create end-consumer value (flint and mentzer 2006). specifically, this research highlights the importance of fulfillment operations for service recovery within an omni-channel retail environment. this research is important considering that in in an omni-channel retail environment fulfilment operations may play a new and important role in recovering from out-of-stocks and could help retailers \\\"save the sale.\\\" additionally, this research contributes to the literature that investigates how consumers respond to out-of-stocks. historically, this body of work has exclusively focused on exploring 19  consumer responses to out-of-stocks in a single channel setting (e.g. zinn and liu 2008; pizzi and scarpi 2013). however, with the emergence of omni-channel retailing, consumers have new options, in terms of their behavioral responses, when a stockout occurs. this research extends the current understandings of consumer responses to out-of-stocks by considering an omni-channel retail context. furthermore, given the shift towards an omni-channel retail environment, wherein consumers have increased expectations and immediate switching capabilities (brynjolfsson et al. 2013), it is essential for retail managers to understand consumer behavior and how consumers evaluate different fulfillment operations. this research highlights that a fast stockout recovery is essential for positive consumer perceptions. however, it is important to understand that not all recovery efforts will be evaluated by consumers equally. this research shows that the shopping context (purchase criticality) as an important effect on how consumers perceive different recovery attributes. managers may wish to gain an understanding of the recovery attributes that are most valued by consumers to increase consumer satisfaction and repurchase intentions. this research considers the attributes of convenience and speed. these attributes are evaluated considering the situational involvement of the consumer in the shopping process and thus provide further insights for managers. this research shows that consumers evaluate the attributes differently based on their situational involvement. thus, managers should adjust their recovery strategies according to consumer's situational involvement to provide the most value and satisfaction to consumers. dissertation outline following the introduction in chapter one, chapter two focuses on how omni-channel fulfillment operations are related to a retailer's performance. next, chapter three constitutes the 20  qualitative study, which explores operational ambidexterity within the drop-shipping context. chapter four consists of a series of experiments that investigate how omni-channel fulfillment operations impact service recovery after a stockout has occurred. lastly, chapter five will conclude this dissertation by summarizing the grand findings of this dissertation.  21  references  adams, j.s. 1965. \\\"inequity in social exchange.\\\" advances in experimental social psychology 2: 267\\u201399.  adler,

performance                        30  introduction  in early 2013, macy's announced that it would be dedicating an additional 200 stores by the end of the year for the purpose of fulfilling online orders (ryan 2014). now, macy's is one of the leading retailers competing in the current retail landscape. by integrating their physical and electronic fulfillment operations (referred to as an omni-channel) (brynjolfsson et al. 2013), macy's was able to gain more flexibility to efficiently and effectively fulfill consumer demand and address increasing consumer expectations. however, anecdotal evidence with regards to the effectiveness of omni-channels is mixed. while some retailers have reported performance improvements due to the implementation of omni-channel fulfillment operations (forrester research, inc. 2014), others failed to report any performance enhancements whatsoever (pwc 2015). because technological advancements are thought to disrupt and alter the traditional retail landscape (brynjolfsson et al. 2013; rigby 2011), it is pivotal to understand why some retailers might be able to succeed within this new omni-channel reality while others might not be able to thrive.  macy's standing as one of the leading retailers in the u.s. is largely due to its emphasis on improving existing fulfillment operations while simultaneously developing new fulfillment services, such as online ordering and in-store pickup options (vishwanath and mulvin 2001). in particular, when retailers fulfill online customer orders from physical stores, it allows the retailer to leverage pre-established fulfillment operations (metters and walton 2007), while simultaneously employing new fulfillment services for consumers. this anecdotal evidence suggests that retailers may need to develop \\\"ambidextrous\\\" fulfillment operations to compete and survive within this new reality of omni-channel. using the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity (e.g. tushman and o'reilly 1996; raisch and birkinshaw 2008), this study 31  investigates how retailers manage and prioritize their investments and developments with regards to their fulfillment operations and how that may lead to improvements in a retailer's operational and financial performance.  rothaermel and alexandre (2009, 759) define ambidexterity as an \\\"individual's ability to use both hands with equal ease\\\". in the organizational management literature, ambidexterity is used to describe the concept of balancing existing activities (exploitation) and new activities (exploration) (march 1991). thus, the main premise of ambidexterity is that firms can achieve higher performance outcomes if they are able to balance activities pertaining to exploration and exploitation (march 1991). it is widely accepted within the management literature that firms will achieve higher performance outcomes if they are able to become \\\"ambidextrous\\\" (lubatkin 2006; he and wong 2004; junni et al. 2013). similarly, the operations management literature suggests that firms that are able to exhibit ambidexterity in their operational activities might be able to achieve superior performance outcomes (patel et al. 2012). alternatively, those companies which fail to establish a balance between their exploration and exploitation activities, might not achieve optimal performance outcomes. a company that focuses exclusively on exploitation may lack the necessary capabilities to respond appropriately to changes in the environment (levitt and march 1988). correspondingly, a company that focuses exclusively on exploration may find itself in an reiterative circle of search leading to no performance enhancements (levinthal and march 1993).  the majority of extant research exploring fulfillment operations uses analytical modeling to analyze the link between single and multi-channel fulfillment operations and estimate potential cost trade-offs (e.g. bretthauer et al. 2010; alptekino\\u011flu and tang 2005). this body of research is limited insofar as it lacks an in-depth exploration of this linkage 32  between fulfillment operation and firm performance. furthermore, a limited number of studies have developed empirical models to study the impact of fulfillment operations on operational (randall, netessine, and rudi 2006) and financial performance (xia and zhang 2010). however, research exploring the link between a retailer's fulfillment operations and its operational and financial performance within an omni-channel retail context is still lacking.  this research will make several contributions to the operations and supply chain management literature. first, it empirically explores the potential benefits of ambidextrous fulfillment operations within the u.s. retail industry. prior research suggests that ambidexterity may be advantageous for firms to achieve higher performance outcomes, specifically within service industries (junni et al. 2013). furthermore, while the majority of operational ambidexterity research relies solely on survey data, this study uses a combination of data extracted from content analyses and financial information from compustat to overcome the limitations of using survey data, such as common method and key informant bias (roth 2007; gattiker and parente 2007). research implementing quantitative content analyses is limited in the operations management discipline (montabon et al. 2007), but remains an interesting and innovative approach to analysis, particularly in this field (tangpong 2011). thus, this research follows boyer and swink's (2008) call to employ diversified data sources in operations management research and specifically addresses tangpong's (2011) suggestion to use content analysis tools for operations management research. the remainder of this manuscript will first provide an overview of the fulfillment operations literature. next, the theoretical underpinnings and hypotheses will be presented following by an overview of the methodological approach and the results. the paper concludes with a discussion of the research findings and implications. 33  literature review   consolidating physical and electronic retail channels in order to achieve a seamless retail environment carries some operational challenges, specifically in terms of order fulfillment, insofar as this act essentially necessitates a redesign of the retail supply chain. the physical retail environment is characterized by central warehouses and distribution centers that deliver products by the truck-load to respective retail stores, where end-consumer demand is fulfilled (metters and walton 2007). in the electronic retail environment, retailers take a different approach and end-consumer demand is directly fulfilled from a central warehouse location (metters and walton 2007). with the advancement of omni-channel retailing, however, online orders may be fulfilled either by a central warehouse or a dedicated store(s), hence combining the benefits of both approaches and fostering synergy effects across channels (agatz et al. 2008). this is particularly advantageous for retailers, as their aim is ultimately to fulfill demand as efficiently as possible, be it by a store, distribution center, or manufacturer (strang 2013). nonetheless, this introduces new complexities to the retail supply chain and also impacts operations.  the more recent online fulfillment literature can be distinguished into two streams of research. the first stream focuses exclusively on online fulfillment operations (e.g. rabinovich 2005; netessine and rudi 2006; acimovic and graves 2015). internet retailers can fulfill end-consumer demand via their own inventory stocking locations, through an external supplier that directly fulfills end-consumer demand upon the retailer's request (also known as drop-shipping), or by using a hybrid of these two strategies. the optimal fulfillment strategy for retailers depends on various external factors, such as drop-shipping mark-up, transportation costs (netessine and rudi 2006), market value, product popularity (bailey and rabinovich 34  2005), product variety, demand uncertainty, and firm age (randall et al. 2006), to name a few. for example, retailers using drop-shipping may optimize their profits by dividing incoming orders based on high and low priority (ayanso et al. 2006) and may achieve higher fulfillment performance due to emergency transshipments (rabinovich 2005) or inventory consolidation (rabinovich and evers 2003). the second stream considers fulfillment operations within a multi-channel context (i.e. retailers that operate physical stores and have an online presence). integrating physical and electronic channels allows retailers to offer new and different fulfillment services to end-consumers, such as online ordering and in-store pick up or return (vishwanath and mulvin 2001). accordingly, these new services also require retailers to rework their fulfillment strategies. for example, retailers may need to evaluate whether online demand should be fulfilled from a distribution center or from retail stores. research shows that a retailer can determine the optimal number of stores which handle online order fulfillment based on the percentage of online sales (bretthauer et al. 2010). thus, retailers can potentially decrease their costs by selecting only dedicated stores to offer new fulfillment services, such as online ordering and in-store pick up or return (mahar et al. 2014). still issues may occur; for example, fulfilling online demand from in-store inventory could lead to a lack of inventory availability in stores (bendoly 2004) and hence retailers could potentially face a loss in sales.  as was previously mentioned, the majority of the literature investigating fulfillment operations employs analytical research methods and focuses on optimizing cost trade-offs for various fulfillment options. research exploring the potential operational and financial benefits for retailers employing omni-channel fulfillment operations is still lacking. xia and zhang (2010) are among one of the first to empirically investigate the potential advantages of multi-35  channel retailers in comparison to traditional retailers. their findings show that retailers operating multiple channels achieve superior operational and financial performance outcomes in comparison to single-channel retailers. however, their research focuses exclusively on comparing different types of retailers and does not consider the impact of different fulfillment operations, per se. in addition, their study only considers retailers operating up until 2008, which was before the majority of retailers developed omni-channel fulfillment operations. further research has corroborated their findings (forrester research, inc. 2014), while others have contradicted it, failing to report any performance improvements due to the implementation of omni-channel fulfillment operations (pwc 2015).  given such limited, yet diversified and seemingly conflicting findings, a study that further investigates the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations on the performance of retail firms is undoubtedly warranted. in this way, this research contributes to the relevant literature stream by empirically examining the operational and financial effects retailers from three different retail segments (general merchandise, drug and food, and apparel) might experience when implementing omni-channel fulfillment operations.  conceptual framework and hypotheses   ambidexterity is a relatively recent theoretical view which has primarily been addressed by organizational research (raisch and birkinshaw 2008) but has, of late, also been used in the operations management discipline (e.g. patel et al. 2012; kristal et al. 2010). ambidexterity originated in the organizational learning literature (march 1991) and implies that in order to be successful, firms should meet current business demands (exploitation) while simultaneously adapting to environmental changes (exploration) (duncan 1976; gibson and birkinshaw 2004; tushman and o'reilly 1996).  36  according to march (1991, 71) exploitation is defined as a firm's activities that are characterized by, for example, refinement, efficiency, implementation, and execution, whereas exploitation is understood as a firm's activities that include risk taking, experimentation, flexibility, discovery, and innovation to name a few. contrary to earlier research, which argued that firms cannot achieve alignment between their exploration and exploitation activities (hannan and freeman 1977), march (1991) suggests that firms that are able to create and foster such a balance and in so doing, will achieve greater performance outputs. considered individually, exploitation is likely to lead to more short-term performance enhancements, whereas exploration is believed to impact long-term performance (march 1991). however, taken together a firm balancing exploratory and exploitative firm activities is likely to achieve short-term, as well as long-term performance outcomes, and hence, better performance outcomes over all. based on the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity, i developed a model proposing that a retailer's operational and financial performance is dependent on the balance it maintains between its exploratory and exploitative fulfillment operations. furthermore, external factors, such as firm-specific characteristics (e.g. resource endowment) is believed to further amplify the relationship between ambidexterity and firm performance, which are thus accounted for in the theoretical model outlined in figure 1. 37   figure 2: theoretical model for this study, i build upon the exploration and exploitation constructs and define them within the context of retail fulfillment operations, where exploratory fulfillment operations are denoted by activities which aim to develop and establish new and innovative fulfillment options and exploitative fulfillment operations are denoted by activities that help to improve and refine pre-established fulfillment operations. following uotila et al. (2009), the balance between exploration and exploitation is readily apparent when looking specifically at a firm's relative exploration activities. a low relative exploration indicates that retailers primarily focus on exploitative fulfillment operations whereas a high relative exploration is an indicator for retailers focusing primarily on exploratory fulfillment operations.  successful omni-channel fulfillment operations are dependent on inventory management and inventory allocation in the supply chain (e.g. bretthauer et al. 2010; alptekino\\u011flu and tang 2005). following prior research, operational performance is defined as the extent to which a retailer is able to effectively manage its inventory (alan et al. 2014; gaur et al. 2005). thus, for the purpose of this study operational performance refers to a firm's inventory turnover, gross margin return on investment, and cash conversion cycle. financial performance, as it is defined in the extant literature, is understood in terms of return based metrics, such as return on assets and return on investment (e.g. carr 1999; vickery et al. 38  2003), or market value based metrics, like tobin's q (jacobs et al. 2010; uotila et al. 2009). in line with the previous research then, exploring the impact of ambidexterity on financial performance, i.e. market value, seems appropriate (uotila et al. 2009), especially since market value has the advantage of capturing long-term and short-term performance effects (lubatkin and shrieves 1986; allen 1993). thus, for the purposes of this research, financial performance is defined as market value.  exploratory and exploitative activities are fundamentally different in terms of their underlying structures, processes, and resources; this causes tension between exploratory and exploitative activities within a firm (he and wong 2004). for example, firms face significant risks in terms of not achieving optimal performance outcomes when they exclusively emphasize one activity (e.g. exploration or exploitation) over the other. firms focusing on exploitation might experience short-term performance benefits, however, they might fail to report positive long-term performance outputs, since these firms are not able to adapt to environmental changes (uotila et al. 2009). as a result, these companies are likely to experience a competency trap since they lack the necessary capabilities to adjust and address changes in their environment (levitt and march 1988). for example, radio shack announced bankruptcy in early 2015 after failing to adapt to changes in the retail sector due to the emergence of the internet (ruiz and de la merced 2015). radio shack is thus an example of a retailer that focused on exploiting its pre-existing fulfillment operations in its physical stores, without taking into account changes in the online retail environment. as a result, they were not able to sustain future activities and were forced to declare bankruptcy.  alternatively, retailers focusing exclusively on exploratory activities might find themselves exposed to the risk of  a reiterative circle of searching for and developing new 39  fulfillment operations (levinthal and march 1993) with highly variable and often volatile long-term benefits (uotila et al. 2009). since these retailers' pre-existing competencies and capabilities are not continuously refined or improved in a timely manner, they miss out on realizing many short-term benefits (march 1991). for instance amazon, a retailer known for its innovativeness always exploring new fulfillment activities, reported positive profits for the very first time eight years after the company was founded (stone 2013). in sum, based on the premises of ambidexterity, firms concentrating on either exploitative or exploratory activities, but not both, will experience less than optimal performance outcomes (march 1991). consequently, rather than focusing on trade-offs between exploration and exploitation, research shows that companies should become ambidextrous to achieve superior firm performance. the tenets of ambidexterity calls for retailers to establish a balance between refining their pre-existing fulfillment operations and discovering new fulfillment operations (e.g. offering online orders and in-store pick up) in order to achieve superior operational and financial performance outcomes. prior research has demonstrated that firms can achieve higher performance outcomes if they are able to balance their exploitative and exploratory activities (he and wong 2004; junni et al. 2013; cao et al. 2009). the literature situated in the operations management realm has corroborated this claim, evidencing the importance of ambidextrous operations in order to achieve better performance outcomes (patel et al. 2012). thus, an inverted u-shape relationship is hypothesized: h1: a retailer's relative exploration exhibits a curvilinear relationship on the retailer's financial performance such that retailers focusing predominantly on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities will exhibit lower tobin's q than retailers balancing exploitative and exploratory (medium relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. h2: a retailer's relative exploration exhibits a curvilinear relationship on the retailer's operational performance such that: 40  h2a: retailers focusing predominantly on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities will exhibit lower inventory turns than retailers balancing exploitative and exploratory (medium relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. h2b: retailers focusing predominantly on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities will exhibit lower gmroi than retailers balancing exploitative and exploratory (medium relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. h2c: retailers focusing predominantly on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities will exhibit higher cash conversion cycles than retailers balancing exploitative and exploratory (medium relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities.  based on our discussion above, retailers concentrating on exploitative or exploratory activities face the risk of either achieving only short-term benefits or only long-term benefits leading to less than optimal performance outcomes overall (march 1991). literature suggests that the ambidexterity-performance relationship might also depend on firm-specific factors, such as resource endowment, which refers to a firm's availability of resources (raisch and birkinshaw 2008). according to the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity, exploratory and exploitative activities stand in competition for a firm's available resources (march 1991), as firms face the challenge of deciding which activities to allocate their available resource to.  the management and allocation of available resources within a firm depends on the firm's organizational structure (moch 1976). thus, the success of balancing exploratory and exploitative fulfillment operations will depend to the extent that a retailer is able to manage and allocate its resources accordingly. in general, large firms can be characterized by having a complex hierarchical structure impeding the resource allocation within the organization (blau 1968). contrary, small firms lacking a complex structural hierarchy are able to allocate resources fairly easy across the organization to various business activities (moch 1976). thus, specifically large firms might experience difficulty in managing and attaining their resource 41  allocating in a balance of exploratory and exploitative business activities. however, for small firms lacking a complex organizational structure it can be easier to cope with the management and allocation of resources making the achievement and attainment of a balance between exploitation and exploration more beneficial. prior research has shown that smaller firms with limited resource availability benefit most by focusing on achieving a balance between exploitation and exploration (cao et al. 2009). therefore, i hypothesize: h3: resource endowment moderates the relationship between a retailer's relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its financial performance such that the relationship between a retailer's relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its tobin's q is negatively moderated by resource endowment. h4: resource endowment moderates the relationship between a retailer's relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its operational performance such that: h4a: resource endowment negatively moderates the relationship between a retailer's relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its inventory turn. h4b: resource endowment negatively moderates the relationship between a retailer's relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its gmroi. h4c: resource endowment positively moderates the relationship between a retailer's relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its cash conversion cycle.  methodology  data the data for this study are compiled from two different data sources. firm-level financial data were collected from compustat and firm-level data pertaining to a retailer's omni-channel fulfillment operations were collected from electronic press releases from the lexis-nexis database. this approach is in line with other research using secondary data to investigate the ambidexterity-performance relationship (e.g. uotila et al. 2009). furthermore, 42  scholars have called for more research employing longitudinal data sets to explore the impact of ambidexterity on firm performance as a way to gain a better understanding of the effects over time (kristal et al. 2010; patel et al. 2012).  while most retailers introduced omni-channel fulfillment operations after 2010, leading omni-channel retailers, such as macy's and walmart, began as early as 2007/2008. to ensure these earlier press releases are taken into account, the longitudinal data were collected starting from 2004 until 2014, spanning a ten year period. this time period has been selected to ensure that sufficient data are available pertaining to retailer omni-channel fulfillment operations, insofar as it is a fairly recent phenomenon.  sample following prior research (alan et al. 2014; gaur et al. 2005), the selection of retail firms was based on the four-digit standard industry classification (sic) codes that the u.s. bureau of commerce assigns to each company within industry segments. the sample includes 164 publicly traded retailers from 12 different retail industry segments, which is in line with previous research focusing on the context of the retail industry (gaur, fisher, and raman 2005). based on the sic codes and similarity in terms of products sold by the retailers, we created three sic groups. sic group 1 consolidates general merchandise stores, sic group 2 food and drug stores, and sic group 3 apparel retailers. table 1 summarizes the retail industry segments and their respective sic codes. a total of 25 retailers was removed from the sample due to not having at least four consecutive yearly observations between 2004 and 2014 or being international retailers. the final sample consists of 39 u.s. retailers in sic group 1, 44 u.s. retailers in sic group 2, and 56 u.s. retailers in sic group 3. the overall sample has a total of 1289 firm level observations.   43  firms operating in highly dynamic and competitive environments are more prone to become ambidextrous than firms operating in less dynamic and competitive environments (raisch and birkinshaw 2008). sic groups 1 through 3 represent different subgroups of retailers facing unique environmental conditions within their respective retail segments. for example, sic group 2 (food and drug stores) is associated with a less dynamic and competitive retail environment in comparison to sic group 1 (general merchandise stores) and 3 (apparel) (mazzone & associates, inc. 2015). hence, one would expect that the predicted relationships might depend on the retail segment that retailers are operating in and thus, i subsequently test the hypotheses for each individual sic group to control for the unique environmental settings each retail segment is facing and to gain more nuanced insights. table 1: retail industry segments with

inc.  content analysis  this research employed a structured content analysis of press releases concerning u.s. retailers as a way to capture activities pertaining to omni-channel fulfillment operations. the extant operations and supply chain management research that employs structured content 44  analyses is limited, but such a method may prove particularly useful in extracting and analyzing data from archival documents, such as press releases or company reports (tangpong 2011). for example, this method has been used by operation and supply chain scholars to explore firms' social responsibility (tate et al. 2010) and environmental management activities (montabon et al. 2007; hofer et al. 2012). thus, this research approach is in line with other studies implementing structured content analysis. the press releases were collected from the lexis-nexis database and i limited the search within the database to the archives of business wire and pr newswire. only those press releases that contained the name of the retailer in the headline and discussed a retailer's fulfillment operations were inlcuded. once all press releases were collected, duplicates were removed and the word frequency for exploratory and exploitative words using atlas.ti was extracted. with the availability of content analysis software, manual coding has been widely replaced by automated computer coding. research shows that there is no significant difference in the accuracy between automated and human coding (king and lowe 2003), thus automated coding is a feasible alternative to human coding procedures (neuendorfer 2002) and is used for the purpose of this research.  this methodological approach is in line with uotila et al. (2009) who developed a methodology to assess a firm's ambidexterity based on secondary data and frequency word counts. i extended uotila et al.'s (2009) methodological approach by tailoring the operational definition of exploration and exploitation to a supply chain and operations management context. uotila et al. (2009) used the rather general definition for exploration and exploration following march (1991). march (1991) refers to exploration as terms such as \\\"search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, innovation\\\" and 45  exploitation as terms such as \\\"refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, execution.\\\"  to extend and adjust the operational definition of exploitation and exploration to a supply chain and operations management context, i developed a list containing synonyms of the proposed terms by march (1991) from three different online dictionaries (theasaurus.com, oxforddictionaires.com, and merriam-webster.com). any word duplicates were removed leaving a list of 384 potential synonyms. two independent coders were selected to evaluate each of the word, determining whether they should be included as a synonym within the context of supply chain and operations management or not. the coders were provided a detailed description for the coding process. the percent agreement between the two independent coders was 80.7%. any discrepancies between the two coders were resolved by the primary researcher. a total of 40 additional synonyms representing the supply chain and operations management context were included to operationalize exploration and exploitation. table 2 summarizes the word roots which were used in this research. table 2: operationalization of exploration and exploitation   word roots exploration explor*, search*, variation*, risk*, experiment*, play*, flexib*, discover*, innovat*, analy*, investig*, reserch*, study*, pursu*, adjust*, change*, develop*, modific*, redesign*, revamp*, shift*, transform*,  test*, trial*, interact*, operat*, accomodat*, cooperat*, resilience*, variab*, identifi*, utili*  exploitation exploit*, refine*, choice*, production*, efficien*, select*, implement*, execute*, expan*, improve*, upgrade*, assembl*, build*, construct*, manufactur*, output*, produc*, capab*, capacit*, pick*, execut*, handl*, operat*, fulfill*   note: words in bold indicate the original synonyms proposed by march (1991)   46  independent variables exploration and exploitation  following the approach of uotila et al. (2009), the main variable of interest is a retailer's relative amount of exploratory versus exploitative omni-channel fulfillment activities that can be observed at the firm-level. the relative amount of exploration versus exploitation was calculated for each retailer (by year) by dividing the number of word occurrences that relate to exploratory activities by the sum of exploratory and exploitative words. this approach was used previously by uotila et al. (2009) to measure companies' ambidexterity based on data  from a structured content analysis;  resource endowment  following prior literature, firm size is an effective proxy from which to measure a firm's resource availability (cao et al. 2009; lin et al. 2007), since large firms often have higher resource availability than small firms (chen and hambrick 1995; boyer et al. 1996). firm size has been operationalized in various ways, but is most commonly done so in terms of the number of employees a firm has, i.e. its human resources (e.g. cao et al. 2009; koufteros et al. 2007) or with regards to a firm's sales in dollars (e.g. hofer et al. 2012) or assets (e.g. lin et al. 2007; eroglu and hofer 2011) which refers to its physical resource availability. in the context of this research, a firm's physical resources are most appropriate to study the ambidexterity-performance relationship. since this research focuses on omni-channel fulfillment operations, resources for day-to-day operations (current assets) as well as fixed physical resources (fixed assets) are expected to play an important role for retailers developing ambidextrous fulfillment operations. thus, in line with previous operations management 47  research, firm size will be measured in terms of a retailer's total assets (e.g. eroglu and hofer 2011).  dependent variables operational and financial performance  for retailers, inventory management is one of the key operational activities. retailers strive to reduce their optimal inventory levels to enhance their overall competitiveness and performance. since omni-channel fulfillment operations are directly related to a restructuring of inventory allocation and management in the retail supply chain, inventory effectiveness is an appropriate operational outcome to explore. prior research has primarily focused on inventory productivity (e.g. chen et al. 2007; huson 1995; gaur et al. 2005; alan et al. 2014) and several different measures have been proposed, such as inventory turnover or gross margin return on inventory (gmroi) (alan et al. 2014). following alan et al. (2014), i will focus on inventory turnover and gmroi as our inventory productivity measures. in addition, i focus on the cash conversion cycle as an additional important operational outcome variable (e.g. hendricks et al. 2009) since it reflects how fast a company can turn its resource investments into cash. the three measures were calculated as follows: (i) inventory turnover (it) \\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc47\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 =\\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc3a\\ud835\\udc46\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 \\u2212 \\ud835\\udc3f\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc39\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 + \\ud835\\udc3f\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc39\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc56,\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc49\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 + \\ud835\\udc3f\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc39\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 (ii) gmroi \\ud835\\udc3a\\ud835\\udc40\\ud835\\udc45\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 =\\ud835\\udc46\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 \\u2212 \\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc3a\\ud835\\udc46\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 + \\ud835\\udc3f\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc39\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc56,\\ud835\\udc61 \\u2212 \\ud835\\udc3f\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc39\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc56,\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc49\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 + \\ud835\\udc3f\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc39\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 48  (iii) cash conversion cycle (ccc) \\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 = \\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc60 \\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc63\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc66 \\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc54\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 +  \\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc60 \\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc60 \\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc54\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61\\u2212 \\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc60 \\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc4f\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc52 \\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc54\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 prior research has highlighted the important linkage between a firm's operational and financial performance (e.g. hendricks and singhal 2005; hendricks and singhal 2009; alan, et al. 2014). accordingly, this study also pays particular attention to a retailer's financial performance. in line with previous research, market value serves as an appropriate outcome variable (uotila et al. 2009). market value has been operationalized in the operations management literature as tobin's q (e.g. setia and patel 2013; modi and mishra 2011) and has the advantage of capturing long-term and short-term performance results (lubatkin and shrieves 1986; allen 1993). tobin's q (tq) is calculated as follows: (\\ud835\\udc56) \\ud835\\udc47\\ud835\\udc44\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 =\\ud835\\udc40\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc58\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc61 \\ud835\\udc63\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc52 \\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc53 \\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc35\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc58 \\ud835\\udc63\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc52 \\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc53 \\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc60 since the data set spans a time period of 10 years, a dummy variable to account for the economic recession occurring in late 2008 was included. year 2004 through 2008 are coded as 0 and years 2009 through 2014 are coded as 1. hence, the year dummy is capturing the potential impact the economic recession of 2008 might have had on retailers' financial and operational performance. table 3 provides an overview of the variable definitions and descriptive statistics.    49  table 3: variable description and descriptive statistics variable description mean std. deviation tq tobin's q is calculated as a retailer's market value of assets over its book value of assets. compustat: (at-ceq+csho*price)/at 1.93 1.73 tq_lagged tobin's q lagged by one period. 1.93 1.78 it inventory turn  7.26 9.21 it_lagged inventory turn lagged by one period 7.24 9.28 ccc cash conversion cycle 52.71 46.85 ccc_lagged cash conversion cycle lagged by one period. 52.82 43.93 gmroi gross margin return on investment 3.48 3.38 gmroi_lagged gross margin return on investment lagged by one period 3.43 2.92 relexp relative exploration 0.21 0.29 ta_log log transformation of total assets 6.99 1.86 n=138 empirical analysis and results  a dynamic panel data model was used to test the hypotheses. based on the characteristics of the data set, a two-step dynamic gmm estimator was applied using xtabond2 in stata (roodman 2009). the data set is unbalanced and has missing values. the gmm estimator accounts for missing values by using orthogonality conditions and hence, exploits all the information that is potentially available in the data set using internal instrument (roodman 2009). since the number of instruments is quartic in the time period, i controlled for the number of instruments used in the model by employing the collapse demand in stata. the dynamic gmm model is an appropriate estimator for a dynamic model with a large number of cross-section units (n=131 retailers) and a small time period (t=11 years). furthermore, the explanatory variables cannot be assumed to be strictly exogenous and hence, one must account for potential endogeneity. the difference gmm estimator allows to estimate models with predetermined and/or endogenous explanatory variables.  50  the year dummy and log transformed total assets were treated as strictly exogenous variables. the lag of the dependent variables entered the model as endogenous variables, and following uotila et al. (2009) relative exploration was treated as a predetermined variable. for each of the four dependent variables i estimated three models: model 1 is the base model including the control variables, model 2 includes the main effect variables and tests hypotheses 1 and 2, and model 3 includes the interaction terms to test hypothesis 3 and 4.  for sic group 1 (general merchandise stores) there is a significant curvilinear relationship between relative exploration and tobin's q. the result indicates that retailers in this segment who are able to balance exploitative and exploratory fulfillment operational activities (medium relative exploration) exhibit higher tobin's q than retailers who focus predominately on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. hence, h1 is supported for sic group 1. however, resource endowment does not function as a moderator of the relationship between relative exploration and retailers' financial performance, leading to rejecting h3 for sic group 1. furthermore, for the remaining dependent variables (it, gmroi, and ccc) no significant effect of a retailer's relative exploration was detected suggesting that retailers in sic group 1 do not gain operational efficiencies due to becoming more ambidextrous in terms of their fulfillment operations. we reject h2a, h2b, and h2c for sic group 1. moreover, resource endowment does not moderate the relationship between a retailer's relative exploration and its operational performance. therefore, h4a, h4b, and h4c are rejected. error! reference ource not found. reports the statistical results for sic group 1.   51  table 4: empirical results of the dynamic gmm models for sic group 1 dv: tobin's q sic1 dv: it sic1  model 1 model 2 model 3  model 1 model 2 model 3 relexp  1.903*** 2.927 relexp  0.091 0.360   (0.593) (2.187)   (0.308) (0.999) relexp2  -1.637** -2.140  relexp2  -0.041 -1.102   (0.807) (3.225)   (0.371) (1.506) relexp*ta_log   -0.151 relexp*ta_log   -0.030    (0.232)    (0.103) relexp2*ta_log   0.073 relexp2*ta_log   0.126    (0.328)    (0.155) tq_lagged 0.707*** 0.682*** 0.426*** it_lagged 0.383** 0.419*** 0.435***  (0.135) (0.135) (0.104)  (0.165) (0.141) (0.128) ta_log -0.032 -0.068* -0.028 ta_log 0.111 0.143 0.127  (0.026) (0.039) (0.043)  (0.107) (0.111) (0.113) yeardummy 0.236*** 0.289*** 0.242*** yeardummy -0.096 -0.100 -0.088  (0.078) (0.048) (0.068)  (0.064) (0.074) (0.061) constant 0.593* 0.642* 0.798* constant 1.545 1.213 1.308  (0.329) (0.347) (0.414)  (1.121) (1.082) (1.032) wald chi2 37.59 (3) 72.42 (5) 58.59 (7) wald chi2 6.39 (3) 13.04 (5) 23.69 (7) hansen 0.020 0.525 0.967 hansen 0.223 0.380 0.970 ar(1) z -1.59 -1.60 -1.64 ar(1) z -1.63 -1.70 -1.70 ar(2) z -1.50 -1.45 -1.57 ar(2) z 0.99 1.01 1.01 number of instruments 13 35 57 number of instruments 23 34 56 note: tq_lagged=tobin's q lagged by one period;

ta_log=log transformation of total assets discussion  the empirical results support that retailers in certain segments who are able to balance exploitative and exploratory fulfillment operational activities achieve higher financial performance than retailers who focus predominately on either exploitative or exploratory fulfillment operational activities. this is specifically the case for general merchandise (sic group 1) and apparel (sic group 3) retailers operating in highly dynamic and competitive retail segments. it is suggested that retailers who are becoming ambidextrous in terms of their fulfillment operations are able to harvest short-term as well as potential long-term financial benefits. hence, these retailers are likely to gain a financial advantage over other retailers focusing on either exploitation or exploration despite increasing fulfillment costs. based on the empirical evidence, food and drug stores (sic group 1) do not seem to benefit financially from being ambidextrous in terms of their fulfillment operations. the food 61  and drug retail segment can be characterized as being  relatively mature and stable (mazzone & associates, inc. 2015). since the reason for a firm to pursue explorative activities is to adapt to changes in the environment, firms operating in stable environments might not need to invest in explorative activities and achieve a balance between exploitative and exploratory activities. prior research suggests that achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation is specifically important for firms operating in highly dynamic environments and does not have a significant performance impact for firms operating in stable environments (zahra and george 2002).  in addition to exploring the linkage of operational ambidexterity and financial performance, i also examined the potential impacts on a retailer's operational performance. while the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity and its impact on a firm's financial performance have received support in prior research (e.g. he and wong 2004; uotila et al. 2009), extending it to a firm's operational performance is rather new. a retailer's ambidexterity in terms of omni-channel fulfillment operations did not lead to enhancement in terms of inventory turns. this was a consistent finding across all three sic groups and anecdotal evidence might explain the lack of support. retailers investing into omni-channel fulfillment operations frequently report operational inefficiencies due to exploring new fulfillment opportunities while exploiting already established ones (aptos, inc. 2016). for example, until recently american eagle operated separate distribution centers for its in-store and online fulfillment services which increased its operational expenses (guillot 2016). since the emergence of the omni-channel retail environment is a rather recent phenomenon and retailers are still struggling to adjust to the operational challenges, the data might have captured a time period which is characterized by operational inefficiencies.  62  however, i do observe that apparel retailers (sic group 3) who are becoming operationally ambidextrous in terms of their fulfillment activities achieve a higher gmroi than apparel retailers focusing on either exploitation or exploration. thus, operationally ambidextrous apparel retailers have a greater ability to turn their respective inventory into cash which might also be due to generally higher margins (mazzone & associates, inc. 2015) and the notion that 18% of each sale has been shown to come from satisfying consumers' omni-channel expectations (aptos, inc. 2016). moreover, the insights from the results pertaining to the potential moderating effect of firm size are more nuanced. based on the theoretical underpinnings we expected small retailers to be better at managing and allocating their available resources due to the lack of a complex organizational structure (moch 1976) and hence, to be better attain the balance between exploratory and exploitative fulfillment operations. in line with the predictions, the results illustrate that resource endowment plays an important role in the context of omni-channel retailing specifically when focusing on operational performance outcomes. for example, while there is lack of evidence of operational ambidexterity impacting performance outcomes for sic group 2 overall, the results show that the effect is contingent on retailer size. hence, although larger retailers might have more resources available, in line with prior research (cao et al. 2009) i found evidence that smaller retailers benefit more from achieving and attaining a balance between exploitative and exploratory activities which might be due to their ability to easier cope with their resource allocation and management.   63  theoretical contributions  by employing a relatively novel data collection and generation approach i was able to provide more nuanced insights into the phenomenon under study. ambidexterity has only recently been addressed in the operations management literature. the limited number of studies use survey data providing only subjective insights from key informants at one specific point in time. to overcome these limitations, i followed the call for research implementing content analysis (tangpong 2011) and using a variety of different data sources (k. boyer and swink 2008) for operations management studies. by combining the ambidexterity data extracted from press releases and actual financial and operational measures from compustat, i provided objective measures for the ambidexterity-performance relationship. this approach led to a longitudinal data set which allowed me to investigate the phenomenon over time overcoming the limitations of using survey data (kristal et al. 2010; patel et al. 2012). in addition, i am building on the methodological approach of uotila et al. (2009) who defined exploitation and exploration in a broad business context following the original definitions from march (1991). i recognized this as a limitation and systematically adjusted the definitions for exploitation and exploration to a supply chain and operations management context. hence, i extended the vague and rather broadly held theoretically definitions of exploitation and exploration to the operations management context.  furthermore, by considering three sub segments of retailers in this study, i was able to provide more nuanced insights for the importance of the environmental context when examining the impact of operational ambidexterity on performance. the environmental circumstances seem to play an important role for our understanding of why some retailers are able to achieve performance enhancements due to balancing exploratory and exploitative 64  fulfillment operations while others may not. hence, this study highlights the environmental context as an important boundary condition for the ambidexterity-performance relationship. lastly, the premises of ambidexterity might provide a theoretical explanation for the reporting of mixed performance outcomes of retailers operating in an omni-channel retail environment (pwc 2015). based on this research, retailers failing to report any performance enhancements due to developing omni-channel fulfillment operations might solely focus on exploring new fulfillment operations rather than striving for a balance between exploiting their already established fulfillment operations while simultaneously developing new fulfillment operations. hence, this research furthers our understanding of the ambidexterity-performance relationship for retail supply chain management research.  managerial implications  while the development of omni-channel fulfillment operations is still growing, it is slowly becoming the norm. based on a recent survey, for 80% of retailers omni-channel fulfillment operations are either not profitable or they are not aware of it (aptos, inc. 2016). i provide evidence to managers that specifically within the general merchandise and apparel retail segment the investment in omni-channel fulfillment operations improves a retailer's profitability. hence, specifically retailers operating in highly dynamic and competitive retail segments might benefit financially from establishing omni-channel fulfillment operations.   however, managers should also be aware of the potential operational inefficiencies they might face especially at the beginning of investing in omni-channel fulfillment operations. as the results indicate, retailers in the apparel segment who have invested in developing omni-channel fulfillment operations for probably the longest period of time are just seeing now at 65  least some positive impacts on their operational performance. thus, while retailers developing omni-channel fulfillment operations might achieve financial improvements rather in a short-term, the potential operational improvements might only be achieved after a longer period of time.  furthermore, it is suggested that large retailers as well as small retailers seem to benefit from investing into omni-channel fulfillment operations. while small retailers might not have as many resources available as large retailers do, the former might benefit most from achieving a balance between exploiting already established and exploring new fulfillment operations rather than focusing on either exploration or exploitation. larger retailers, however, have the advantage of being able to draw upon their available pool of slack resources (chen and hambrick 1995) and maintain periods of focusing on either exploration or exploitation. thus, specifically managers of smaller retailers that currently focus on either exploitation or exploration should allocate their limited resources accordingly and try to achieve a balance between these both activities.  future research the contextual setting selected for this research is quite unique. the data set represents a time period (2004-2014) where omni-channel retailing just started to emerge and grow over the last couple of years. the selected time period is characterized by retailers suffering from operational inefficiencies due to developing omni-channel fulfillment operations (aptos, inc. 2016). once omni-channel becomes more mature, retailers might actually be able to gain operational efficiencies. therefore, future research should extend this study to a later point in time when omni-channel retailing will be more mature. a replication of the current study 66  would provide further insights on the linkage between operational ambidexterity and financial and operational performance at different life cycle stages of omni-channel retailing. furthermore, the sample is constrained to publicly traded retailers in the u.s. and hence, the predictions are limited in terms of generalizability. thus, future research endeavors could extend this research to other geographical regions. each country has a unique retail landscape, and being able to contrast the operational ambidexterity performance relationship across different countries might provide more nuanced insights. also, future research might consider exploring online retailers and the extent to which these retailers develop ambidextrous fulfillment operations within an omni-channel retail environment. this kind of research might provide us with a better understanding of the operational ambidexterity-performance relationship within another unique retail context. however, the linkage between operational ambidexterity and performance does not have to be solely investigated within the retail industry. extending this research to other industries might provide further interesting insights.  lastly, future research might also want to explore additional boundary conditions. the rapid developments in technology (brynjolfsson et al. 2013; rigby 2011) provide retailers with new and innovative technological options, which have the potential to enhance the performance of their omni-channel fulfillment operations (anderson and lee 2000). operations and supply chain managers suggest that enabling inventory visibility across retail channels is important in facilitating successful omni-channel fulfillment operations (strang 2013). 48% of retail managers perceive inventory visibility as a major inhibitor for successful omni-channel fulfillment operation (aptos, inc. 2016). thus, exploring the potential moderating effect of inventory visibility might be an important consideration for future research.  67  references  acimovic, j., and graves, s.c. 2015. \\\"making

retail omni-channel fulfillment operations on the upstream supply chain                        75  introduction  the development of omni-channel fulfillment operations has led to the emergence of new operational complexities in the retail supply chain. managers are now faced with the challenge of developing new ways to efficiently and effectively manage omni-channel operations to meet consumer expectations and achieve a competitive advantage (brynjolfsson et al. 2013; strang 2013). it has been suggested that in order for retailers to be successful, they should develop the necessary capabilities to fulfill consumer demand from anywhere \\u2013 the store, the distribution center, and/or directly from suppliers (strang 2013). while the role of retailers, as it pertains to fulfillment operations, has received a lot of attention in the literature (e.g. randall et al. 2006), research investigating suppliers and their operational capabilities for successful demand fulfillment within this new reality is lacking. specifically, considering the recent emergence of drop-shipping as a viable fulfillment option in the omni-channel retail environment suggest that suppliers will experience significant changes to their fulfillment operations which warrants further research. drop-shipping, also known as consumer direct fulfillment, refers to a fulfillment strategy where end-consumer orders are fulfilled directly from suppliers upon a retailer's request (cheong et al. 2015). while this fulfillment strategy has been predominantly used in online retailing (e.g. randall et al. 2006; netessine and rudi 2006), it can also be successfully implement in an omni-channel retail environment. contrary to traditional retail supply chain management, suppliers may now engage  directly with end-consumers, directly fulfilling end-consumer demand in the name of a retailer (agatz et al. 2008).  as a result, suppliers are likely to experience a disruption in their current fulfillment operations and might develop new fulfillment capabilities while refining pre-established ones 76  in order to succeed within the new reality of omni-channel retailing. this suggests that suppliers may need to become \\\"ambidextrous\\\" in terms of their fulfillment operations in order to adapt to the changes in the retail environment. this is particularly important when considering the fact that suppliers might not only fulfill pallet size retail orders but simultaneously may also develop the necessary capabilities to fulfill individual consumer orders (agatz et al. 2008).  ambidexterity is simply defined as an \\\"individual's ability to use both hands with equal ease\\\" (rothaermel and alexandre 2009, 759). within a business context, prior research defines ambidexterity as a balance of activities pertaining to exploitation and exploration (march 1991). thus, ambidexterity refers to firms being able to be aligned and efficient in meeting current business demands (exploitation) while simultaneously adapting to environmental changes (exploration) (duncan 1976; gibson and birkinshaw 2004; tushman and o'reilly 1996). building on this, the concept of operational ambidexterity, which refers to \\\"an operational unit's simultaneous pursuit of exploration and exploitation [activities]\\\" (patel et al. 2012), has recently been introduced to the operations management literature. relevant research shows that firms which are able to exhibit ambidexterity in their operational activities tend to achieve superior performance outcomes (patel et al. 2012).  operations and supply chain management research falls short when it comes to exploring how companies actually achieve operational ambidexterity. even in the management literature, research considering the antecedents of ambidexterity is lacking (adler et al. 1999; siggelkow and levinthal 2003). however, it is pivotal to gain a thorough understanding of the drivers, barriers, and complexities that lead firms to achieve operational ambidexterity, specifically within the new reality of omni-channel retailing, where operational ambidexterity 77  might be the key factor to a supplier's success. in response, the proposed study addresses the following research questions: (1) to what extent do suppliers exhibit ambidextrous fulfillment operations within the omni-channel retail environment? (2) what are the enablers and barriers for suppliers to develop ambidextrous fulfillment operations?  since the concept of operational ambidexterity is still relatively new and this research is exploratory in nature, a qualitative research approach will be used to address the aforementioned research questions. this is in line with the operations management literature calling for more qualitative research to address operational phenomena (barratt et al. 2011; mccutcheon and meredith 1993). in addition, the majority of the literature investigates drop-shipping from the perspective of retailers (e.g. rabinovich 2004, randall et al. 2002), developing mainly analytical models (e.g. yao et al. 2008). hence, by employing a qualitative research approach we address the methodological shortcomings associated with quantitative research methods and aim to provide a more thorough and realistic understanding of drop-shipping operations (flynn 1990). the remainder of the paper will provide a brief overview of the relevant fulfillment operations literature and discuss the theoretical foundations. subsequently, the methodological approach as well as the data collection and analysis processes will be discussed. literature review  the emergence of the internet led to a disruption in how supply chain activities are managed and executed (anderson and lee 2000). traditionally, suppliers fulfilled retailers' pallet-sized orders, but given the changing retail environment, suppliers are increasingly expected to also fulfill individual orders from end-consumers in the name of the retailer (agatz et al. 2008). while this latter fulfillment option, also referred to as drop-shipping, is a 78  fulfillment strategy that has been predominately used in online retailing (rabinovich et al. 2008; bailey and rabinovich 2005), it may prove a viable fulfillment option across other retailer environments as well (randall et al. 2002).  drop-shipping has been exclusively explored within the context of online retailing (e.g., rabinovich et al. 2008; ayanso et al. 2006; acimovic and graves 2015) and three streams of research can be distinguished. the first stream of research concentrates on the impact of drop-shipping on fulfillment performance (e.g., rabinovich 2005). more specifically, this body of work investigates how drop-shipping performance can be enhanced through emergency transshipment (rabinovich 2005), inventory consolidation (rabinovich and evers 2003), and coordinating order-to-ship times and delivery times (rabinovich 2004). furthermore, in the case of drop-shipping, retailers are now primarily concerned with attracting end-consumers, while suppliers are concerned with fulfillment operations. this functional separation is likely to lead to difficulties in the management of the fulfillment processes (gan et al. 2010; yao et al. 2008). however, if suppliers provide poor fulfillment performance, end-consumers are likely to hold the retailer accountable (bulger 2012; rabinovich 2005). prior research highlights the importance of the relationship between high fulfillment performance and end-consumer satisfaction and future purchase behavior (e.g. esper et al. 2003; rao et al. 2011). taken together, this stream of literature suggests that drop-shipping is likely to improve an online retailer's fulfillment performance considering different members of the supply chain. while the first stream of research focuses on the potential performance outcomes, the second stream investigates the conditions under which drop-shipping might be superior to other fulfillment options for online retailers. this body of work provides evidence that online retailers should consider product (randall et al. 2002) and environmental characteristics 79  (netessine and rudi 2006) when deciding to engage in drop-shipping operations. for example, randall et al. (2002) found that it is more desirable for online retailers to have heavy and bulky products fulfilled via drop-shipping. moreover, with the option of employing different fulfillment operations retailers are challenged by deciding which fulfillment option, or mix therefore, is most desirable. the majority of the research supports that a mixed approach in terms of fulfillment operations is most profitable (e.g., bailey and rabinovich 2005; netessine and rudi 2006). for instance, bailey and rabinovich (2005) show that online retailers are better of using drop-shipping in combination with owning inventory. overall, this body of work suggest that drop-shipping operations constitutes as one option of their overall fulfillment portfolio and should be employed based on evaluating more nuanced product and environmental characteristics. the third stream of research focuses on exploring how retailers best manage the relationship with their drop-shipping partners. retailers give up a fair amount of control when implementing drop-shipping (rabinovich et al. 2008); this suggests the difficulty retailers face in holding their suppliers accountable for high fulfillment performance standards. to address this issue, different management strategies, pertaining to the retailer-supplier relationship in a drop-shipping context, have been investigated. for example, research shows that revenue sharing incentives tend to improve the reliability of a drop-shipper (yao et al. 2008). the elimination of information asymmetry in the retailer-supplier relationship has also proved beneficial, insofar as discrepancies of demand and inventory information might lead to either excessive inventory or inventory unavailability (gan et al. 2010; cheong et al. 2015). in addition, retailers and suppliers may experience cost reductions and performance improvements if information accuracy can be mitigated via contracts or through information 80  transparency (i.e. sharing demand and inventory information), for example (gan et al. 2010; cheong et al. 2015). these findings are in line with other research that considers the importance of visibility for successful supply chain management (williams et al. 2013). nevertheless, the current literature falls short in addressing other important research endeavors pertaining to drop-shipping. as most intriguing appears to be the fact that within the new omni-channel retail environment suppliers are expected to develop drop-shipping fulfillment operations to meet individual end-consumer demand (orders), while simultaneously fulfilling pallet size retail orders. these different fulfillment operations are likely to rely on different operational processes and capabilities leading to tensions in suppliers' overall fulfillment processes. furthermore, the use of drop-shipping operations is likely to dramatically increase over the next three years (ames 2016) leading to significant changes in a supplier's fulfillment operations and hence, inducing more complexity to the retail supply chain. thus, considering that suppliers play an even more critical role in achieving high fulfillment performance outcomes, an investigation of how suppliers develop drop-shipping operations and integrate these with already established fulfillment operations provides a much needed extension to the extant literature. next, the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity are offered as a way to provide further insight into this topic. theory  over the last decade, ambidexterity has emerged as a new theoretical paradigm in the organizational management literature (o'reilly and tushman 2013; raisch and birkinshaw 2008). the main tenet of ambidexterity, as it is understood in this context, is that in order for firms to achieve superior performance outcomes, they must strike a balance between their exploration and exploitation activities (tushman and o'reilly 1996).  81  according to march (1991, 71) exploitation refers to a firm's activities, which are characterized by \\\"refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, and execution,\\\" whereas exploitation activities are characterized by \\\"search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, and innovation\\\". firms that focus exclusively on one activity or the other will likely experience less than optimal performance outcomes. firms emphasizing exploitation activities might not be able to adequately respond to environmental changes, due to a lack of the necessary capabilities to do so (levitt and march 1988), and firms emphasizing exploration activities might get trapped in an reiterative circle of searching for new alternatives, without achieving satisfactory performance outcomes (levinthal and march 1993).  ambidexterity has recently been applied to study operations and supply chain management phenomena (e.g. patel et al. 2012; kristal et al. 2010; blome et al. 2013). aligning the two competing organizational activities (exploitation and exploration) is recognized by operations and supply chain management scholars as a potential option for companies wanting to overcome the trade-offs between operational efficiency and adaptability (e.g. kristal et al. 2010; patel et al. 2012). the extant operations and supply chain management literature pertaining to ambidexterity is very limited. the few studies that do investigate ambidexterity within operations and supply chain management do so providing empirical evidence for the ambidexterity-performance relationship. for example, kristal et al. (2010) conceptualized supply chain ambidexterity and showed that implementing an ambidextrous supply chain strategy is helpful in developing supply chain capabilities and competencies, which leads to increased firm performance outcomes. thus, future research is warranted to gain a better understanding of how companies become operationally ambidextrous.  82  prior research has shown that especially companies operating in highly dynamic environments are likely to showcase ambidexterity (junni et al. 2013). due to the emergence of omni-channel retailing, the retail supply chain management can be described as rapidly changing and hence, highly dynamic. in order to succeed within this highly dynamic retail environment, suppliers must both sustain and improve current fulfillment operations while simultaneously developing new ones. in this way, the context of drop-shipping serves as a suitable domain to inform this study on operational ambidexterity. methodology  insofar as the proposed research questions are rather exploratory in nature, a qualitative research approach has been deemed most appropriate for this study (ellram 1996). adopting a qualitative approach allows to study the underlying structures, processes, and interrelationships of suppliers' ambidextrous fulfillment operations in great detail and depth (gephart 2004). furthermore, such a method will allow to investigate the phenomenon in an actual contextual setting (meredith 1998). thus, i employ an inductive research paradigm (warren and karner 2005), specifically implementing a case study approach (yin 2009).  i developed a multi-case study design following the logic of literal replication with the aim of identifying cases that would provide similar results (yin 2009). through careful case consideration i ensured that the selected cases would be representative of the phenomenon of interest. thus, the initial population consisted of retail suppliers with freight and drop-shipping operations. since fulfillment operations likely depend on product characteristics (randall, netessine, and rudi 2006) and suppliers generally manage a broad variety of different products and brands, i selected the business unit as our unit of analysis.  83  the focal company for this research is a large u.s. based appliance manufacturer consisting of several business units managing a broad variety of products and brands. due to the broad variety of product and brands, the focal company is overseeing different fulfillment operations to meet the specific brand and product requirements. for the first case i selected a fairly new business unit (alpha) that just recently started to establish drop-shipping operations. the second business unit (beta) is a well-established business unit with its own fulfillment operations and has been engaged in drop-shipping operations for a longer period of time. alpha and beta operate as separate business units and their main offices are located in different cities in the u.s. table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the selected cases. table 1: overview of case characteristics   case characteristics number of informants number of interviews informants' functional areas  alpha alpha is a recently established business unit within the focal company. the current goal of alpha is to gain more brand recognition among end-customers. alpha manages different fulfillment processes for a large appliance. 8 7 logistics and operations management, marketing, information systems, and finance beta beta is a well-established business unit within the focal company and manages its own separate operations. beta offers and manages different fulfillment options for small appliances. 5 4 logistics and operations management,  data collection multiple data collection methods were employed to gather rich descriptive data for the qualitative study. in-depth interviews enable researchers to perceive the world through the eyes of their research participants, which might not otherwise be possible with quantitative methods 84  (charmaz 2014). thus, the primary data collection method were in-depth interviews via case method which was triangulated with secondary qualitative data retrieved from news articles.  the primary researcher spent four days on site to conduct the interviews with several informants for each case study. while higher level managers are able to provide more strategic insights on the phenomenon of interest (joshi et al. 2003), lower level managers are able to provide more tactical insights on the phenomenon of interest. thus, i interviewed informants from different organizational levels. in addition, the primary researcher had the opportunity to visit and tour two of the focal company's distribution centers to observe the operational activities. throughout the four day visit, the primary researcher also had a chance to closely shadow the key informant. i carefully developed a semi-structured interview guide with open-ended questions to guide the conversation, and probes to ask for additional description and details. appendix a provides an overview of the actual interview guide. the interviews lasted between 20 to 100 minutes, and all interviews were audio-recorded with the permission of the informants and professionally transcribed leading to a total of 160 pages of qualitative text. i conducted seven interviews at alpha and five interviews at beta. out of the total of 12 participants, nine held higher managerial positions and three lower level managerial positions. four participants held positions outside the operations/logistics area providing cross-functional insights about the phenomenon of interest.   to gain even more in-depth insights and knowledge on the phenomenon of interest i collected secondary qualitative data in the form of online news articles discussing drop-shipping operations. using news articles discussing the topic of interest allows us to triangulate our data (patton 1990). the online news articles were collected from the top online supply 85  chain management publications for industry professionals by friddell (2015). out of the originally listed 12 top supply chain management publications we selected the ones most relevant to retail supply chain management and with an open search option for articles on the website. i conducted an initial search on each of the online publications' websites with the search terms \\\"drop-shipping\\\" and \\\"drop-ship\\\". table 2 summarizes the top supply chain management publications used for this research and the number of initial articles from each publication. the initial search resulted in 98 articles. next, i removed any duplicates and articles published before the year 2010 since omni-channel retailing especially gained traction after 2010. the final sample constitutes 43 articles for further content analysis. table 2: selected online supply chain

initial coding and focused coding phase of all interviews resulting in a detailed, descriptive memo for each case (ellram 1996; barratt et al. 2011). coding allows the researcher to connect contextual rich descriptions with more abstract theoretical categories, which served as the \\\"bones of the analysis\\\" (charmaz 2014, p.113).  86  the initial coding phase allowed for the emergence of a wide array of theoretical concepts and ideas stemming from the data (charmaz 2014). in the initial coding phase, i assigned a code to a smaller segment of data (i.e. sentence). after the initial coding phase, i moved on to the focused coding phase, during which i sorted, synthesized, and organized large amounts of data into more parsimonious codes.  after going through several iterations between the data and codes and organizing the focused codes in a structured manner, i conducted a cross-case analysis. this analysis allowed me to compare and identify commonalities and differences across the two cases, which allowed for a more complete and holistic understanding of the phenomenon of interest (eisenhardt 1989; yin 2009). lastly, i triangulated the findings from the two cases studies by using a content analysis of the news articles i collected. the news articles were coded using the focused codes emerging from the interview data to substantiate the findings.  to assess the thoroughness of the case study approach, i carefully addressed the proposed evaluation criteria for case study research (yin 2009; eisenhardt 1989; voss, tsikriktsis, and frohlich 2002; stuart et al. 2002): construct validity, internal validity, external validity, and reliability in the case study design and execution. table 3 summarizes the evaluation criteria and how they were implemented.   87  table 3: case

concepts   the following section describes in detail the themes and concepts that emerged from the analysis of the cases and secondary qualitative data. from the data, two frameworks emerged. the first framework is associated with drop-shipping operations and focuses on the drivers and operational challenges thereof. the second framework is grounded in the theoretical underpinning of ambidexterity and captures the underlying mechanisms of 88  operational ambidexterity. figure 1 illustrates the general framework pertaining to establishing drop-shipping operations that emerged from the data and table 4 provides descriptions and examples of the emerging themes. from the analysis of the cases and news articles three main themes emerged, which are denoted as drivers, operational challenges, and outcomes. figure 1: drop-shipping operations: drivers and operational challenges       89  table 4: description and examples for emerging codes category code description example  drivers reacting refers to the supplier developing drop-shipping operations to address the changing retail environment \\\"the market for supply chain design is growing as more companies realize they have to reexamine their networks, and make sure their network of distribution centers and plants are in line with changing market conditions.\\\"   accepting refers to the supplier developing drop-shipping operations as a necessity \\\"so it came out of necessity really, where retailer a and retailer b were not going to hold inventory, they wanted us to just ship direct to their consumers.\\\"    penetrating refers to the supplier developing drop-shipping operations to gain access to more end-customers \\\"i think when xyz was originally launched the perspective was to let's get in as many doors as we can\\\"  operational challenges customization refers to the supplier's problems with customizing the drop-shipping processes \\\"now since the consumer's ordering them, instead of a two-pack of blenders, they want a single blender.\\\"   complying refers to the individual supply chain members problems with adhering to requirements \\\"really as we were onboarding them, trying to get that information on them on the front end.\\\"    coordinating refers to supplier's problems with managing the drop-shipping operations \\\"we're expected to get the d to c orders out the door within 24 hours of receiving them here.  so that's how the people on the floor are supposed to prioritize the work.\\\"         90  drivers of drop-shipping operations  the analysis demonstrates that there are three predominant reasons why suppliers business units/companies decide to establish drop-shipping operations. the first driver of establishing drop-shipping is that suppliers are reacting to the changes in the retail environment. consumer expectations in this new omni-channel retail environment are steadily increasing especially due to the \\\"amazon effect\\\" (ames 2016). as a theme the \\\"amazon effect\\\" emerged from the secondary qualitative data. the \\\"amazon effect\\\" refers to amazon's offering of free and fast shipping which consequently leads to consumers expecting an equivalent high service offerings to be the norm across other retailers (shiphawk 2015). within this new retail environment constituting of high consumer expectations and a fierce competition from other businesses, alpha considers it as a necessity for businesses to rethink and restructure fulfillment operations. a marketing manager at alpha notes: \\\"if people are going online and order their stuff themselves it affects how much brick-and-mortar do you need anymore? how many real buildings? you know, everyone had to redefine.\\\" hence, suppliers seem to develop and establish drop-shipping operations to \\\"redefine\\\" themselves and to adequately react to the changes occurring in the retail environment.  a second theme that emerged for the drivers for drop-shipping operations is accepting drop-shipping operations as a requirement from the retailer. the case observations indicate that the retailer plays an important role for suppliers to establishing drop-shipping observations for two reasons. specifically, the observations for alpha substantiate that retailers \\\"rule the show\\\" almost forcing the business unit to engage in drop-shipping. hence, suppliers might not have another choice than to follow the retailer's requirement and establish drop-shipping operations. one of the logistics/operations managers stated: \\\"well, their role was really to 91  force our hand to develop that because they weren't going to sell with us if we weren't going to ship direct to consumer.\\\"  another reason why suppliers simply accept the fact that they have to establish drop-shipping operations might be due to product characteristics. alpha, managing a large and heavy appliance, experienced reluctance from retailers to further stock the product due to the weight and length dimensions of the product. a logistics/operations manager from alpha noted: \\\"again, it'd be something they don't handle very well with the size and that.  so they said, \\\"if you want to do business here, you're going to do it direct to consumer.\\\"   lastly, suppliers establish drop-shipping operations as a way of directly penetrating the consumer market. in the drop-shipping model the retailer as \\\"middleman\\\" is removed, providing suppliers with direct access to end-customers. in addition, suppliers are also able to offer a larger product variety to end-customers to subsequently increase their market share. thus, the overarching theme of directly penetrating the consumer market consists of accessing end-customers and of servicing end-customers better with a larger product variety. in the case of beta, a logistics/operations manager extensively discussed that drop-shipping operations were established to have access to a larger end-customer base to gain a competitive advantage. the manager noted: \\\"we want to expand drop ship because we think we'll be able to sell a bigger assortment of products for our retailers and they don't have to hold the inventory.  there is a belief that we are missing out on sales and so we need to expand it to more retailers and more footprints.\\\"    92  operational challenges of drop-shipping operations  operational challenges associated with establishing and managing drop-shipping operations emerged as another major theme from the data. while suppliers are used to the processes of fulfilling freight orders for their retailers, the requirement of directly fulfilling end-customer orders involves new processes for the supplier. hence, suppliers adding drop-shipping operations to their fulfillment capabilities are likely to experience operational tensions and challenges the first operational challenge emerging from the cases was customizing the drop-shipping fulfillment process. for example, end-customers might wish to have the product wrapped in gift-wrapping paper or attach a personal note to their order leading to highly customized orders. one factor contributing to the high customization of the drop-shipping process are any value-added services the supplier is executing. hence, each end-customer order is not only different in terms of the products that need to be picked but also in terms of what additional services the end-customers request. a logistics/operations manager from aplpha referred to value-added services as \\\"a nightmare\\\" since it adds additional complexity to the fulfillment process. a manager from beta further elaborated: \\\"like with product x, product x is kind of a huge nightmare because the co2 tanks in them make them hazmat so we have to ship them out specially so they have to be in the vas station to be specially processed so that they go out hazmat.  so there's a lot of stuff that happens in the vas station.\\\"  a second factor contributing to customizing the drop-shipping process is the volume. the cases indicate that especially when only a low volume is fulfilled via drop-shipping, the fulfillment process is prone to be highly manual in nature. in the case of alpha, handling a small volume for drop-shipping, every step in the drop-shipping process was manually in the 93  beginning. a marketing manager noted: \\\"i mean a lot of the stuff we did was manual. i mean we actually have been drop manual, we manually dropped documents and manually send trucks and manually fix problems. so it was a nightmare from our perspective and trying to start business.\\\"  a second operational challenge that emerged from the data was complying with retailer requirements. the secondary qualitative data specifically highlighted the importance of vendor compliance for successful drop-shipping operations. our secondary qualitative data indicate that \\\"the urgency around attaining the perfect order through compliance programs is amplified, thanks to a number of factors\\\" (terry 2013), one of these factors being the \\\"increasing use of direct shipping from vendors.\\\" however, the observations from the cases indicate that achieving compliance might not be an easy endeavor for suppliers. suppliers work with a great number of retailers and hence, have to adhere to a lot of different requirements dictated by the retailers. a specific problem alpha experienced was that the requirements were only communicated after the sales agreement had been signed, increasing time pressure on other business functions to comply with the requirements. an information systems manager from aplha described: \\\"their mission is go out and get sales agreements.  so they go out and do that and we're \\u2013 i don't want to say the afterthought, but once they get the sales agreement, then they send us all the information with a deadline that sometimes we can meet and sometimes we can't meet.  99 percent of the time we do meet it, but if it's a real short time frame, we meet it but we don't meet it following the processes that we like to follow, but we need to follow to make sure that we have everything covered.\\\" the third theme that emerged was coordinating with other external and internal entities to establish drop-shipping operations. carriers play an important role in the success of drop-94  shipping processes. alpha described an incident where carriers were reluctant to adjust their processes to ensure that the product arrives at the end-customer's house undamaged. the failure to coordinate with the carrier from the beginning on resulted in damaged products and hence, in unsatisfied end-customers. consequently, alpha started to adjust its packaging to prevent damage and coordinated with the carrier to ensure that the product is handled in a different manner. a logistics/operations manager recalled: \\\"getting them (the carrier) to look at a different shipment with different requirements reliably is incredibly difficult when they're just used to turning numbers.\\\"  also, coordinating with internal business functions constitutes a challenge when establishing drop-shipping operations. alpha described a situation where the sales team agreed with the retailer on doing drop-shipping without consulting the logistics/operations managers first. after the agreement had been signed, alpha discovered that it actually did not have the necessary capabilities in place. \\\"so that capability didn't exist and the people over here behind me that handle all the major stuff had no clue as to how to do any of that.\\\"   in addition, the observations suggest that coordinating with the it department is also of essence. in the cases, the majority of orders arrived through the edi system. however, the edi systems were configured to receive standardized retail orders but with drop-shipping the edi systems need to be compatible to receive orders where the ship to address is different for each end-customer. alpha and beta spend ample amount of time and effort with the it department to coordinate the new system configurations. a manager from alpha stated: \\\"chris (name changed by the author) was tremendous in the process of setting them up 'cause he knew what the requirements were and what the capabilities were versus what we had on 95  hand and he figured out how to do the processing of the edi to override the ship to and to do an appropriate direct consumer order taking.\\\"    the general framework of drivers and operational challenges discussed above provides interesting insights and a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon of drop-shipping. in a second level of interpretation i was focusing on uncovering the findings pertaining to the interrelationships of exploitation, exploration, and ambidexterity to gain a better understanding how suppliers become operational ambidextrous. figure 2 illustrates the emerging findings from the second level analysis. figure 2: the cyclicality of exploitation and exploration  operational ambidexterity: an emerging process model  prior to becoming ambidextrous, suppliers focus on exploiting their already established operations (freight operations) to gain further operational efficiencies. in the case of alpha standard operating procedures have been developed and are already in place to execute freight operations. however, through a continuous improvement program developed by the mother 96  company the already existing operating procedures are steadily refined to increase performance. a manager from alpha noted: \\\"[the mother company's] really good at continuous improvement, and putting projects around things, and trying to take as much of that variation as we can out of the system.  we have a pretty solid black belt program and green belt program to go in and try to lean out the operations and dummy proof them as much as we can. \\\"   the focus of improving already established operations gets disrupted by the changing retail environment. thus, suppliers seek to reinvent themselves and rethink their fulfillment operations to stay competitive within this new omni-channel retail environment which subsequently leads to the exploration of drop-shipping operations. a manager from alpha stated: \\\"but the ability for people to go online and learn about the product and see what's going on facebook and twitter and you know. that's what we learned on the major appliance side years, several years ago was what how much more educated consumers are today. they walk in with their iphone and their ipad. they know more about the appliance than you do. they have got all their reviews and all the lots and everything right there in front of them. they can check your price against whoever they want to standing right in front of you.\\\"  furthermore, the cases show that once the supplier acknowledges the changing retail environment, the supplier enters a phase of predominately exploring drop-shipping as a new fulfillment operation. alpha experienced the changing retail environment as a disrupting factor to their already established fulfillment operations which led alpha to \\\"look around at what the processes were inside of [the mother company] for direct to consumer.\\\"  once the supplier enters the phase of focusing on exploring drop-shipping operations, the suppliers experiences the need for balancing already established fulfillment operations with 97  developing the new drop-shipping operations (ambidexterity). the findings from the cases suggest that it depends on the volume how suppliers will manage to keep the balance between the different operational activities. alpha and beta have highly integrated fulfillment processes whereas beta's seemed more advanced since they are automated. alpha, processing a small volume of drop-ship orders and having manual processes, highly integrated its processes for drop-shipping with its already existing operational processes. moreover, this highly integrative approach of balancing freight with drop-ship operations was noted by a manager from alpha as \\\"being the parasite\\\" and \\\"piggybacking.\\\" a manager further explained: \\\"we had to fit our processes to hit their processes because it's just economically desirable to have one additional [product] or five [name of the product removed by the author] units go in with a truckload of other stuff.\\\"  most interestingly, from the conversations with managers from beta (processing a higher volume of drop-ship orders and having an automated system), it emerged that as volume is further increasing the managers will look into separating freight fulfillment operations from drop-shipping operations to some degree. currently beta experiences difficulties in terms of balancing freight with drop-ship orders since each of these activities has different requirements. a manager from beta explained: \\\"when the get mixed together, they're not really mixed together.  it's just these happen before these will happen, so we see really big spikes in our small pack volumes and then our freight volumes die off.  they just conversely work against each other.  so an issue with that process is not being able to differentiate them through our operational how we process them, which results in delayed times to focus on one group or the other.\\\"  98   the cases furthermore indicate that the phase of focusing on exploring drop-shipping operations return to a phase of exploitation. however, in this next phase of exploitation the supplier improved both, freight and drop-shipping operations suggesting that there might be a dynamic component associated with exploitation and exploration. for instance, alpha described a situation where the business unit earlier engaged in exploring how the edi processes for drop-shipping operations can be developed. once these edi processes had been developed, they can now be exploited and implemented with other trade partners. a manager from alpha recalled: \\\"now, if we're gonna maintain retailer x i'm gonna work on getting them on edi just because it needs to happen.  once i get them into [\\u2026] then i think i have an already established and i can just add it as an offering, so i don't have to go back and redo all the testing that i'd done before.  so i think that'll be a big win for us.\\\"  thus, our cases provide evidence for a cyclicality between exploitation and exploration.  discussion and literature integration    the case studies in combination with the secondary qualitative data provide interesting and nuanced understandings of drop-shipping operations and operational ambidexterity. however, to gain a broader understanding of the meaning of the findings, they should be considered within the extant literature. thus, to further interpret the findings i synthesized and integrated the prior literature on drop-shipping and operational ambidexterity into the discussion. while this research corroborates some prior findings, it more importantly offers interesting and new insights into themes not addressed in the prior literature stimulating potential future research ideas.   99  drop-shipping research on drop-shipping is limited and mainly focuses on investigating the phenomenon from the perspective of online retailers, providing insights when it would make sense for a retailer to engage in drop-shipping (randall et al. 2006). in line with the finding that retailers are an important driver for suppliers to establish drop-shipping operations, the drop-shipping literature further substantiates that retailers serve as a driver for suppliers to develop drop-shipping operations (e.g. rabinovich 2005; randall et al. 2006; bailey and rabinovich 2005). however, the findings of this study indicate that other drivers for establishing drop-shipping operations may exist which could be categorized as being external (reacting to the changing retail environment) or internal (penetrating to the market) to the supplier. the most interesting finding probably is that while suppliers might develop drop-shipping operations to service their retailers, suppliers establish drop-shipping operations for their own benefits. thus, this research contributes to the extant drop-shipping literature by providing an explanation of why suppliers establish drop-shipping operations.   retailers deciding to engage in drop-shipping leave their suppliers not only with the associated costs and risks but also the responsibility of executing all fulfillment operations to the retailer's standards (rabinovich et al. 2008). while the decision for retailers to engage in drop-shipping might be more strategic in nature, the suppliers will take on all operational responsibility and associated challenges. therefore, this research extends the current drop-shipping literature by shifting the research focus away from retailers to suppliers; and hence, shifting the focus from a strategic towards a more tactical perspective since suppliers will be required to figure out the details as it pertains to establishing efficient drop-shipping operations. 100  the findings pertaining to the operational challenges of complying and coordinating suggest that these issues are rooted within the broader subject of managing relationships in supply chain management. the findings advocate that businesses appear to still operate within functional silos and lack coordination with other supply chain partners although extensively discussed in the literature (e.g. stank et al. 1999; fawcett and magnan 2002). furthermore, the finding of suppliers complying with retailers' requirements could be perceived as one mechanisms that governs the supplier-retailer relationship. overall, these findings suggest that there might also be a relational component to establishing and managing successful drop-shipping operations such as supplier accommodation (murfield and esper 2016) or internal and external integration (flynn et al. 2010). furthermore, prior studies employed only quantitative methods to investigate the impacts of drop-shipping operations (e.g., bendoly 2004; elliot rabinovich 2005). while quantitative methods are appropriate to explore specific relationships between two or more variables deducted from theory, these methods do not allow for a richer and descriptive exploration of the phenomenon. by employing a qualitative approach using a case study designs and secondary qualitative data, this research provides a rich and descriptive understanding of drop-shipping operations uncovering the associated drivers and operational challenges. therefore, this research helps and extends our current understanding of the drivers of drop-shipping operations and associated operational challenges. operational ambidexterity the notion of ambidexterity has only recently been introduced to the operations management field and the resulting research is fairly limited (patel et al.  2012; kristal et al. 2010). in an operations management context, the theoretical premises of ambidexterity suggest 101  that companies exploiting already existing operational activities while exploring new operational activities will achieve higher performance outcomes than if the company focuses on either of these two activities (duncan 1976; gibson and birkinshaw 2004; tushman and o'reilly 1996). the limited body of work on operational ambidexterity focuses exclusively on testing the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity rooted in the field of management neglecting why and how firms develop and manage operational ambidexterity. the qualitative research approach provided me with the opportunity to stimulate a discussion about the theoretical understanding of operational ambidexterity. a key findings from this research suggest that exploration of new operational activities require a \\\"trigger\\\" or \\\"disruptive event\\\". this observation suggests that in the context of drop-shipping, environmental changes may serve as a trigger shifting the focus of companies away from exploiting already existing business activities and leading them to focus on exploring of new business actions. prior research has shown that firms facing a highly competitive and dynamic environment exhibit tendencies to engage in exploring new business activities (jansen et al. 2005; auh and menguc 2005) and support our observations.  this research further enhances our understanding of operational ambidexterity by providing at least some insights into the widely debate about the appropriate internal structural solution to manage ambidexterity. the ambidexterity literature lacks a clear understanding whether ambidexterity is achieved through integration or separation (raisch and birkinshaw 2008). from the management literature addressing ambidexterity structural differentiation emerged as one option to successfully manage ambidexterity (e,g., tushman and o'reilly 1996; gilbert 2005). however, the extent to which these structural differences should be integrated is not well understood yet, and hence, warrants further investigation. considering 102  operational ambidexterity in the context of drop-shipping, the findings of this study suggest that if the processes volume for drop-shipping is low, a higher degree of operational integration is appropriate while a lower degree of integration (or separation) is perceived to be more appropriate with higher volume. thus, this research exposed volume to be an important contingency factor to consider when investigating the structural solution for managing operational ambidexterity. in addition, i was able to present some evidence suggesting that exploitation and exploration occur in a cyclical nature, suggesting that suppliers shift between phases of exploiting established operations and exploring new operations. the cyclical nature of exploitation and exploration in a drop-shipping context might suggest that operational ambidexterity is a dynamic process rather than a static status. this observation is further substantiated by nickerson and zenger (2002) and siggelkow and levinthal (2003)  who suggested that firms cycle through phases of exploitation and exploration. thus, suggesting that there is critical dynamic component to exploration and when it actually transfers into exploitation. however, prior research on operational ambidexterity focused on investigating the phenomenon at a specific point in time, neglecting any potential effects over time.  based on the discussed findings future operational ambidexterity is warranted. the discussed findings pertaining to operational ambidexterity uncover additional interesting and relevant research areas to grow the understanding of operational ambidexterity within the supply chain and operations management field. table 5 provides suggestions for additional research in different areas pertaining to operational ambidexterity.   103  table 5: future operational ambidexterity research research area future operational ambidexterity research  antecedents of operational ambidexterity investigate antecedents that shift suppliers from focusing on exploiting already established fulfillment operations to exploring new fulfillment operations. managing operational ambidexterity explore how suppliers balance already established operations with new operations depends on the processed volume such that a low volume may be associated with a higher degree of process integration than a high volume.  role of time for operational ambidexterity consider the potential time effects on exploration and exploitation. exploration of new operational activities is finite in time duration and hence, there is a specific point in time when explorations of new operational activities turns into exploitation of established operational activities.  managerial implications and future research  managerial implications the importance for suppliers to be able to provide drop-shipping operations for their customers is further increasing. the majority of retail managers expect to increase their use of drop-shipping over the next three years (ames 2016). i provide insights to managers that the request for drop-shipping might take the supplier as a surprise with a lack of preparedness. hence, in anticipation of more demand for drop-shipping operations from retailers, suppliers should evaluate whether they already have the necessary drop-ship capabilities in house and develop a plan for implementation to be better prepared for this new fulfillment option. in addition, establishing drop-shipping operations constitutes a great opportunity for suppliers to gain access to a broader end-customer base. therefore, suppliers might want to consider establishing drop-shipping operations as a viable option to further penetrate the market and to grow their market share.  104  furthermore, when establishing drop-shipping operations suppliers should work closely with other supply chain members. this research indicates that retailers play an important role for establishing successful drop-shipping operations. suppliers are likely to provide drop-shipping solutions to a broad retailer base and hence, will have to adhere to different compliance guidelines. retailers could help suppliers to achieve higher compliance rates by aligning their compliances with the ones from other retailer. for example, the retail value chain federation works with retailers to arrange the used terminology and terms to support the operations of the suppliers (terry 2013).  moreover, this research suggests that the importance of carriers and other internal departments for successful drop-shipping operations cannot be neglected. for example, if the product is damaged during the delivery process because the carrier is reluctant to adjust its handling operations from freight to individual end-customer orders, end-customer responses might be negative impacting suppliers and retailers a like. hence, carriers should be informed and integrated into establishing drop-shipping operations early on to ensure carriers have the necessary capabilities and operating procedures in place. in addition to integrating carriers, managers should also strengthen the integration of departments within the company. as the findings of this research show, especially the sales and operations functions still appear to be not integrated leading to major issues. thus, the internal integration especially between sales and operations but also with other functional areas should be increased. lastly, the findings of this research suggest that suppliers should carefully evaluate the degree of integrating their drop-shipping operations with its freight operations. suppliers that drop-ship only low volumes might benefit from a higher degree of integration with the already 105  established freight operations. however, suppliers that drop-ship large volume might benefit from a lower level of integration between its freight and drop-ship operations. limitations and future research  this research is grounded in the context of drop-shipping and hence, might not be generalizable to other contexts. future research might consider other contextual settings that would suggest suppliers to exhibit operational ambidexterity to provide further insights. such an extension of this research would further provide understanding into why and how suppliers become operationally ambidextrous.  in addition, this research is qualitative in nature and thus, provides only an exploratory, rich and deep description of drop-shipping and operational ambidexterity. while this research reveals several themes and their potential interrelationships, future research might wish to complement it by employing a quantitative research approach. for example, survey research could be used to further investigate the potential drivers of drop-shipping and hence, of operational ambidexterity.   lastly, i conducted two case studies that lend themselves for a literal replication. however, to gain further theoretical insights on how suppliers become and manage operational ambidexterity further case studies would be required to allow for a theoretical replication (yin 2009). thus, to extend this research one might consider cases with suppliers that do not have established drop-shipping operations yet to better contrast them against our findings.    106  references  acimovic, j., and

for service recovery                         115  introduction  frequent stockouts are a major concern for retailers. this is because stockouts often lead to negative consumer behavior (zinn and liu 2001) and substantial financial losses for retailers (aastrup and kotzab 2009). however, within the new reality of omni-channel retailing, described as a seamlessly integrated retail environment of physical and electronic channels (brynjolfsson et al. 2013), retailers have new options to potentially \\\"save the sale\\\" in the case of a stockout. following a stockout, a retailer may offer to order the unavailable product online and ship it to either the store or directly to the customer's home. for example, in early 2015, jc penney, a national, mid-range department store in the u.s., began offering free online shipping of unavailable products to the store. thus, in the case of a stockout, jc penney leverages its omni-channel fulfillment operations to provide their customers with products, even though the product is unavailable in the store. this example illustrates that omni-channel retailers might now have the necessary retail service operations to provide consumers with a more timely and convenient stockout recovery than in the past. while retailers might have the necessary service fulfillment operations in place to recover from a stockout, it is important to gain an understanding of how consumers evaluate these services (roth and menor 2003). prior research demonstrates that service failures lead to negative consumer attitudes and behaviors, such as dissatisfaction (e.g. allen et al. 2014), negative word-of-mouth (e.g. lin et al. 2011), or customer complaints (knox and van oest 2014). having a service recovery strategy in place (kelly et al. 1993) provides companies with the opportunity to transform negative consumer attitudes and behaviors into positive ones (bitner et al. 1990). service operations literature specifically stresses the importance of consumers' \\\"fairness\\\" perceptions when evaluating a company's recovery efforts (craighead et al. 2004). positive post-recovery 116  perceptions can be achieved if a retailer meets consumers' recovery expectations through offering the right bundle of recovery strategies. this in turn is likely to translate into more equitable (\\\"fair\\\") perceptions leading to improved post-recovery satisfaction levels (e.g. roggeveen et al. 2012).  in the case of a stockout, retailers traditionally had either no or only limited options to recover from such a failure. for instance, a retailer could provide consumers with alternative substitute products (breugelmans et al. 2006) or offer a rain check (kelley et al 1993). however in an omni-channel retail environment, a retailer's operational activities can now be used to recover from a stockout (miller et al. 2000). one interesting issue that emerges within the omni-channel retail environment is whether consumers perceive it as \\\"fair\\\" if the retailer leverages its omni-channel fulfillment operations to recover from a stockout. it is also suggested from prior literature that situational factors, such as purchase urgency, might play an important role when investigating consumer responses to stockouts (e.g. zinn and liu 2008; zinn and liu 2001; peinkofer et al. 2015). hence, contextual effects influence whether consumers evaluate a retailer's recovery strategy as more equitable (\\\"fairer\\\"). thus, while fulfillment operations now play a new and increasingly important role in stockout recovery these emerging issues warrant further exploration. this is specifically important considering that the majority of retailers still struggle with implementing and managing their omni-channel operations, despite the fact that omni-channel fulfillment is slowly becoming standard (forrester research, inc. 2014).  therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine how omni-channel fulfillment operations can be used to recover from a stockout. more precisely the aim is to investigate (1) how, in the case of a stockout, different attributes of a retailer's omni-channel fulfillment 117  operations impact consumer satisfaction and their evaluation of a retailer's physical distribution service quality (pdsq); (2) how do consumers evaluate these service recovery attributes in terms of perceived \\\"fairness\\\"; and, (3) the role the purchase experience's contextual effects have on consumers' evaluation of a retailer's stockout recovery strategy. using equity theory (adams 1965), this manuscript implements a series of experimental studies to explore the impact omni-channel fulfillment operations have on consumer satisfaction levels and pdsq evaluations. more precisely, the studies examine if various fulfillment service attributes, such as convenience and speed, positively impact consumer satisfaction after a stockout. to that end, this manuscript will also investigate the underlying mechanisms for \\\"why\\\" satisfaction occurs. additionally, i consider the shopping context of the consumer (i.e. whether the consumer needs vs. does not need a particular product). thus, this manuscript will contribute to the growing body of literature examining consumer issues in supply-chain and operations management (e.g. rao et al. 2011b; griffis et al. 2012b). the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows: reviews of the relevant literature pertaining to inventory availability, fulfillment operations, service recovery, and associated supply-chain issues are presented. the manuscript then proceeds by introducing the theoretical framework and research hypotheses. literature review  fulfillment operations  the body of literature focusing on consumer issues in the fields of operations and supply-chain management is still growing. over the last decade, two distinct streams of 118  literature have emerged. the first stream considers investigates inventory management, product distribution, and order fulfillment strategies within an online retailing context (e.g. rabinovich and evers 2003; rabinovich 2004; griffis et al. 2012b; cheong et al. 2015). this body of research focuses on the internal or operational aspect of retail service operations (roth and menor 2003). for instance, researchers investigate whether inventory consolidation (rabinovich and evers 2003) and emergency transshipments (rabinovich 2005) can prevent or improve order fulfillment. they also investigate how trade-offs in actual and signaled order-to-shipment and delivery times impact consumer attitudes (rabinovich 2004). further, this stream of research considers the potential cost trade-offs between various fulfillment strategies, such as inventory holding and transportation costs (e.g. cheong et al. 2015; netessine and rudi 2006; bendoly et al. 2007). overall, this stream of literature argues that retailers should develop and then leverage an online channel to achieve high product availability and fulfillment performance. moreover, implementing an omni-channel supply-chain enables retailers to evaluate different fulfillment strategies in terms of cost and profitability. the second stream focuses on consumers' responses to order fulfillment processes and failures, particularly late deliveries (rao et al. 2011b), product returns (griffis et al. 2012a; rao et al. 2014), and stockouts (e.g. dadzie and winston 2007; pizzi and scarpi 2013). this stream highlights the growing importance of consumer-level variables, such as consumer satisfaction (e.g. esper et al. 2003) and perceptions of pdsq (e.g. koufteros et al. 2014). for example, boyer and hult (2006) find that different order fulfillment strategies impact consumer retention differently and rao et al. (2011a) show that the perceptions of a retailer's pdsq positively correlate with consumer satisfaction and retention levels.  119  the second stream specifically highlights the importance of retailers achieving positive consumer pdsq perceptions (e.g. rao et al. 2014; rabinovich and bailey 2004; griffis et al. 2012b). understanding how consumers evaluate a retailer's service operations is key to offering superior retail services (roth and menor 2003). consumers are more satisfied and more likely to re-purchase from a retailer when they perceive a retailer's pdsq performance to be high (rao et al. 2011a). consumer perceptions of pdsq gain further importance when evaluating a stockout recovery within an omni-channel retail context. if a stockout occurs, consumers tend to negatively evaluate a retailer because their pdsq is presumed to be insufficient. however, by leveraging established omni-channel fulfillment operations, retailers might be able to turn this negative situation into a positive pdsq evaluation. since failures in the fulfillment process are likely to result in negative reactions from consumers and may lead to a loss of sales, this stream of research emphasizes the importance of retailers and their respective supply-chain members to provide reliable and exceptional fulfillment services to consumers. inventory availability inventory availability constitutes a key operations performance measure of retail supply-chains (emmelhainz et al. 1991), however poor supply-chain management (dehoratius and raman 2008; ettouzani et al. 2012; raman et al. 2001) may result in stockouts that negatively impact manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. stockouts fall under typical retail operation failures (kelley et al. 1993) and a growing body of literature investigates the potential impact of stockouts for upstream and downstream supply chain members has emerged.  120  research has established that consumers negatively react to retail operation failures (e.g. pizzi and scarpi 2013; kim and lennon 2011; rao et al. 2011b; ofla\\u00e7 et al. 2012). for example, pizzi and scarpi (2013) show that stockouts negatively impact re-patronage behavior and rao et al. (2011b) provide evidence for delivery failures leading to a decrease in the frequency and size of future orders. therefore, retailers need to implement recovery strategies to mitigate these negative reactions. with regard to stockouts, kim and lennon (2011) and breugelmans et al. (2006) argue online retailers should inform their consumers up front about inventory availability. and pizzi and scarpi (2013) suggest that online retailers can mitigate negative consumer responses by taking responsibility for the stockout. these strategies only lessen, but do not fully recover, consumer dissatisfaction following an operational failure. however, within the new reality of omni-channel retailing, retailers have the opportunity to fully recover from a stockout by leveraging their omni-channel fulfillment operations.  to summarize, prior research has contributed to an understanding of how consumers respond to stockouts in a single-channel retail setting. with the growth of online retailing over the past decade, the vast majority of work has been conducted exclusively within an online retailing context (e.g. griffis et al. 2012a; pizzi and scarpi 2013; rao et al. 2011b). a small body of literature has started to explore how consumer dissatisfaction resulting from retail service failures might be mitigated. however, important research opportunities have not yet been addressed, such as how an omni-channel retail environment disrupts and alters traditional consumer behavior and expectations pertaining to stockouts. moreover, extant research has not considered how omni-channel fulfillment operations may help to recover consumer satisfaction following a stockout. thus, there is an opportunity for the service recovery literature to provide 121  further insights with regard to how and why omni-channel fulfillment operations as a recovery strategy can impact consumer satisfaction levels and pdsq evaluations. service recovery a stockout constitutes a service failure, which refers to any service that is unfulfilled, delayed, or does not meet consumer expectations (bitner et al. 1990). service recovery is conceptualized as a firm strategy (hart et al. 1990) that attempts to restore a damaged relationship between a company and a consumer (knox and van oest 2014). however, service failure literature demonstrates that each recovery strategy achieves, if at all, different levels of improved consumer satisfaction. in fact, a strategy's success depends on a series of factors, such as failure type and magnitude (e.g. kelley et al. 1993; smith et al. 1999; blodgett et al. 1997). considering these prior findings, it is of great importance to carefully evaluate which recovery strategies lead to improved consumer satisfaction positive evaluations of a retailers' pdsq in the case of a stockout in an omni-channel retail setting. this manuscript integrates the discussed streams of literature and addresses the research gaps outlined above by: (1) extending the conversation of stockouts into an omni-channel retail environment and (2) investigating which omni-channel fulfillment operations are most advantageous to recovering consumer satisfaction and improving a retailer's pdsq perceptions after a stockout. conceptual framework   equity theory (adams 1965) posits that a consumer's response derives from comparing their internal calculation of outcomes to inputs to the perceived ratio of an average consumer's outcomes to inputs. consumer dissatisfaction is than a perceived imbalance or inequity arising 122  from receiving a lower outcome than the average consumer, providing more inputs than the average consumer, or a combination of both (oliver 1980). therefore, according to equity theory, a consumer experiencing a stockout will receive a lower outcome than the average consumer which leads to an imbalance between a consumer's ratio of outcomes to inputs and an average consumer's ratio of outcomes to inputs. this imbalance, or perception of inequity, leads to consumer dissatisfaction (kim and lennon 2011; pizzi and scarpi 2013).  research has positioned equity theory as an applicable lens to study consumer responses to service recoveries (e.g. grewal et al. 2008; smith et al. 1999; roggeveen et al. 2012). this theory has also been applied to studying supply chain failures, such as late deliveries (rao et al. 2011b) and supply chain recoveries, such as returns management (griffis et al. 2012a).  figure 1 was developed to guide this research and is based on the theoretical foundations of equity theory. in general, the framework for this research proposes that a fast and efficient recovery process impact satisfaction levels and pdsq perceptions, with regard to a retailer's omni-channel fulfillment operations aimed at restoring consumers' perceived inequity after experiencing a stockout.  figure 3: framework  this research consists of four experimental studies including one pretest and three main studies. the pretest helped develop and refine the experimental stimuli for the main studies and 123  was used to ensure only the variables of interest were manipulated (perdue and summers 1986; knemeyer and naylor 2011).  study 1   this study focuses on developing the foundational relationships between a timely and convenient stockout recovery on consumers' equity perceptions. based on these underlying relationships, studies 2 and 3 enhance the baseline model, evaluate other consumer outcome variables, and introduces more sophisticated variations of the proposed relationships. retail evaluations depend, at least partly, on different facets of the recovery process (tax et al. 1998). for the purpose of this research, i am particularly concerned with the dimensions of speed and convenience. speed refers to how fast the recovery strategy is (i.e. next day vs. 9 days) (smith et al. 1999). convenience is a nonmonetary attribute that refers to consumers designating limited effort in order to acquire a product (berry et al. 2002). in this paper, convenience is defined as the location where an (formerly) unavailable product is delivered (i.e. the consumer's home vs. the store).  extant literature demonstrates that successful recovery strategies lead to enhanced consumer satisfaction (allen et al. 2014; roggeveen et al. 2012; tax et al. 1998) and positive company evaluations (e.g. maxham and netemeyer 2002). these positive consumer responses result from repairing the consumers' view of equity on the part of the retailer (e.g. roggeveen et al. 2012). according to equity theory (adams 1965), inequality can be restored either through matching or even exceeding the outcome or through minimizing the investment of additional inputs. in the case of a stockout, a retailer can match the outcome by offering consumers who experience a stockout the option of having the product provided through another channel, for instance. during the stockout recovery process, the consumer is likely to 124  invest additional time and effort until the unavailable product is received. in accordance with equity theory (adams 1965), the retailer should try to minimize the additional consumer inputs, such as time and effort to rectify perceived equity imbalances. for example, a retailer could provide a fast recovery to minimize consumer waiting times. the literature suggests a fast recovery is perceived as \\\"fairer\\\" by consumers in comparison to a slow recovery (hart et al. 1990; smith et al. 1999). in a stockout situation, a retailer has the opportunity to leverage its omni-channel fulfillment operations to provide a fast recovery from the failure in the primary retail channel by delivering the unavailable product through another channel thereby minimizing the time a consumer invests waiting for the product. hence, consumers are more likely to have higher equity perceptions when the recovery is fast than when it is slow.  similarly, a retailer could offer delivering the unavailable product to a more convenient location to minimize the additional effort a consumer invests during the recovery process. in a stockout situation, a retailer has the opportunity to leverage its omni-channel fulfillment operations to have the (formerly) unavailable product delivered to a more convenient location and thus, minimize the additional effort consumers invest during the recovery process (berry et al. 2002). hence, consumers are likely to have higher equity perceptions when the product is delivered to a more convenient location than when it is delivered to a less convenient location. thus, i hypothesize: h1a: a speedy (slow) recovery leads to a higher (lower) levels of perceived equity. h1b: a more convenient (less convenient) location leads higher (lower) levels of perceived equity.  125  while speed and convenience, when considered individually, are likely to lead to higher perceptions of equity, the complete recovery strategy should be seen as a bundle of resources (smith et al. 1999). according to equity theory (adams 1965), equity can be achieved by minimizing the additional inputs, in terms of time and effort, a consumer invests in the recovery process. minimizing additional inputs can be achieved by providing a speedy recovery and having the product delivered to a more convenient location. building on the discussion of h1a and h1b, i would predict that a slow recovery speed is likely to lead to low equity perceptions because the consumer will have to invest more time. however when considering speed and convenience as a bundle of resources, a consumer's overall additional inputs can be minimized by the retailer and equity can be approximated by offering a more convenient delivery location since consumers. accordingly, the consumer will invest less effort overall even when the recovery is slow.  similar logic applies when the product is delivered to a less convenient location. again, delivering a product to a less convenient location increases consumers' time input. however, considering speed and convenience as a bundle of recovery resources (smith et al. 1999), having a speedy recovery but delivering the product to a less convenient location is likely to be perceived as more equitable because overall, the consumer will have to invest less additional time during the recovery process. since, perceived equity depends on how consumers interpret the entire recovery process in terms of speed and convenience, i hypothesize:  h2a: when recovery speed is slow, having the product delivered to a more convenient location will lead to higher levels of perceived equity than when the product is delivered to a less convenient location  h2b: when the product is delivered to a less convenient location, a fast recovery will lead to higher levels of perceived equity than a slow recovery.  126  pretest before the hypotheses were tested in study 1, a pretest was conducted to ensure the validity of our experimental manipulations. for the pretest, i developed a hypothetical shopping scenario following the guidelines of rungtusanatham et al. (2011). in the pre-design stage, i consulted in-store policies of omni-channel retailers to explore the different fulfillment options stores typically provide to consumers in the case of a stockout. based on this review, i identified those retailers who deliver products to a consumer's home or to the store. additionally, retailers differ depending on their speediness of delivery (i.e. next day or 9 days). once i identified these key factors, i developed the written version of the hypothetical shopping scenario. this step involved the careful development of a common and experimental module (rungtusanatham et al. 2011). the common module included all the statements that are constant across all groups and the experimental module included all the statements that varied across experimental groups. the final experimental conditions were reviewed by a total of six experts. integrating their feedback into the experiment enhanced the instructions and scenario clarity. the final experiment for the pretest was a 2 (convenience: delivered to the home vs. to the store) x 2 (speed: next day delivery vs. 9 days delivery) between subjects design, including one control group.  a total of 170 students (61.8% male; mean age of 23.12 years) were recruited from five different business courses at a large, public university in the southern united states. participants received course credit in exchange for participating in the pretest. all participants were randomly assigned (bachrach and bendoly 2011; knemeyer and naylor 2011) to one of the five experimental conditions. 127  to evaluate convenience and speed among the different groups, i excluded our control group from the analysis. i conducted a manova with convenience and speed as the dependent variables, both measured on a 7-point likert-scale (1=strongly disagree;

perdue and summers 1986). the large effect sizes for the convenience condition with \\u03c72=63.36, p<0.001, cramer's v=0.65 and the speed condition with \\u03c72=74.330 p<0.001, cramer's v=0.70 indicate most of the participants were able to identify their respective groups, which supports the validity of our manipulations (miller 2002).  study 1: method study 1 constituted a 2 (convenience: delivered to the home vs. to the store) x 2 (speed: next day delivery vs. 9 days delivery) between subjects design, including one control group and a total of 222 adults from the u.s. participated in the web-based survey via amazon 128  mechanical turk (mturk) (knemeyer and naylor 2011; goodman et al. 2013). participants were randomly assigned to one of the five experimental conditions. the age range of the sample is from 18 to 73, with a mean age of 35.4 years, and approximately 65% of the participants were female. the median combined household income was $40,000 - $49,999, and about 87% reported at least some college education.  study 1: dependent variables and manipulation check measures the outcome variable of interest in study 1 was \\\"equity\\\" (smith et al. 1999) consisting of three dimensions: distributive (which evaluates the outcome), procedural (which evaluates the process in which the outcome is achieved), and interactional equity (which refers to employees behavior). appendix a provides a detailed overview of the item descriptions.  to assess whether participants were aware of their respective treatment condition, two one-item measures were used asking participants to indicate to where the tablet would be delivered (to the home or to the store) and when the tablet would be delivered (the next day or in 9 days). additionally, an instructional manipulation check (oppenheimer et al. 2009) was included at the end of the survey to ensure that participant were aware of the instructions. study 1: manipulation checks to assess whether participants were aware of their respective experimental conditions (perdue and summers 1986; bachrach and bendoly 2011), two-way contingency table analyses were conducted. the significance and large effect sizes (cramer's v=0.943 and 0.977; convenience and speed, respectively) are in line with pretest 1 and hence, confirm the validity of our experimental manipulations (miller 2002).  129  study 1: analysis and results  to test h1a, h1b, h2a, and h2b a two-way anova was conducted with speed (next day vs. 9 days) and convenience (home vs. store) as fixed effects and equity was included as the dependent variable. the analysis shows that there is a significant main effect of speed (f(1,176)=7.68; p<0.01, \\u03b72 = 0.04) on equity, indicating that consumers exhibit higher perceptions of equity if the recovery is fast (mfast = 6.05) rather than slow (mslow = 5.45). thus, h1a is supported. the main effect of convenience is not significant at the 0.05 level, (f(1,176)=5.49; p=0.053; \\u03b72 = 0.02). thus, h1b is only partially supported. no significant interaction effect was revealed.  to test h2a and h2b i build on the anova results by conducting pairwise comparisons of convenience on equity when the recovery speed is slow and speed on equity when the delivery location is less convenient. the results show that for the slow recovery condition, convenience does not enhance perceptions of equity (p = 0.240; mhome = 5.70, mstore = 5.40). thus, h2a is not supported. for the condition when the product is delivered to a less convenient location, speed significantly enhances perceptions of equity (p = 0.08; mnextday = 5.84, m9days = 5.40). thus, h2b is partially supported. study 1: discussion  the findings of study 1 suggest that providing a fast recovery is more essential to achieving higher perceptions of equity than providing a more convenient delivery location. the finding that the recovery attribute of convenience has, in general, only a limited effect on perceptions of equity further supports this interpretation.  130   although these findings provide some insights into which attributes of an omni-channel fulfillment operations may impact consumer perceptions of equity, this study has its limitations. study 1 does not consider other relevant consumer related outcome variables such as satisfaction or perceptions of a retailer's service quality. thus, study 2 introduces post-recovery satisfaction and physical distribution service quality as two new outcome variables. furthermore, study 2 will provide insights into the underlying processes of \\\"why\\\" consumers experience post-recovery satisfaction and positive evaluations of a retailer's pdsq. building on study 1, it seems to be the case that consumers evaluate different recovery attributes as more \\\"equitable\\\" (fairer) which in turn might then lead to heightened satisfaction levels.  study 2    this study investigates whether consumers' post-recovery satisfaction levels and perceptions of a retailer's pdsq are indirectly impacted through their perceptions of equity. equity theory suggests that a consumer's recovery evaluation is a function of previously developed perceptions of equity (adams 1965). these perceptions subsequently translates into enhanced consumer satisfaction (roggeveen et al. 2012) and positive attitudes (oliver 1980). applied to our conceptual model, consumers with high equity perceptions (due to a fast or more convenient recovery) will be more satisfied and will have higher perceptions of pdsq than consumers with low levels of perceived equity (due to a slow or less convenient recovery). for example, roggeveen et al. (2012) provide evidence that equity is the underlying mechanism that restores satisfaction in a recovery involving consumer co-creation. i therefore postulate:  h3: the relationship between speed and convenience and satisfaction and pdsq is mediated by perceived equity, such that: 131  h3a: consumers experiencing a fast recovery will be more satisfied and have higher pdsq perceptions than consumers experiencing a slow recovery, due to higher equity perceptions h3b: consumers having the product delivered to a more convenient location will be more satisfied and have higher pdsq perceptions than consumers having the product delivered to a less convenient location, due to higher equity perceptions. h3c: when recovery speed is slow, having the product delivered to a more convenient location will lead to higher levels of satisfaction and perceived pdsq than when the product is delivered to a less convenient location, due to higher perceived equity. h3d: when the product is delivered to a less convenient location, a faster recovery will lead to higher levels of satisfaction and perceived pdsq than a slow recovery, due to higher perceived equity. study 2: method study 2 also constituted of a 2 (convenience: delivered to the home vs. to the store) x 2 (speed: next day delivery vs. 9 days delivery) between subjects design, including one control group. a total of 261 adults from the u.s. participated in the web-based survey via amazon mechanical turk (mturk) (knemeyer and naylor 2011; goodman et al. 2013). participants were randomly assigned to one of the five experimental conditions. the age range of the sample was from 19 to 76, with a mean age of 36.6 years, and approximately 65.7% of the participants were female. the median combined household income was $40,000 - $49,999, and about 91% reported at least some college education.  study 2: dependent variables and manipulation check measures the dependent variables in study 2 are post-recovery satisfaction (crosby and stephens 1987) and the participant's perception of a retailer's pdsq (koufteros et al. 2014). a retailer's pdsq is operationalized as having three dimensions: timeliness, availability, and condition. the measures were adapted from extant research. timeliness refers to whether the product 132  would be delivered on time; availability refers to whether the retailer is able to provide the product when requested; and, condition refers to whether the product will arrive in good condition. appendix a provides a detailed overview of the two scales used to measure the dependent variables.  study 2: convergent and discriminant validity assessments  convergent and discriminant validity of the dependent measures were assessed through confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) using amos 22.0 for spss. a five-factor model, including satisfaction, timeliness, availability, condition, and equity was estimated. equity was estimated as a second factor model consisting of three dimensions: distributive, procedural, and interactional equity. the cfa fit statistics support our model (hu and bentler 1999): \\u03c72 = 1175.35, df = 392, cfi = 0.93, rmsea = 0.088 (90% confidence interval: 0.082; 0.093), and srmr=0.043.  in support of convergent validity the average-variance extracted (ave) for each factor exceeds 0.5 (fornell and larcker 1981). moreover, all cronbach's alpha (\\u03b1) values exceed 0.8 (nunally and bernstein 1994). in support of discriminant validity for each pair of factors, the ave exceeded the phi-square correlation (\\u02782) (fornell and larcker 1981). table 1 provides a summary of the standardized loadings and cronbach's \\u03b1.     133  table 1: cfa results study 2 item standardized loading cronbach's \\u03b1 equity1_distributive 0.97 0.98

study 2: manipulation checks two-way contingency table analyses were conducted to assess whether participants were aware of their respective experimental conditions (perdue and summers 1986; bachrach and bendoly 2011). the significant and large effect sizes (cramer's v=0.905 and 0.960 for convenience and speed respectively) of the manipulation checks are in line with pretest 1 and study 1. hence, the validity of our experimental manipulations are confirmed (miller 2002). study 2: analysis and results  to assess whether equity would function as a mediator between the recovery attributes and the dependent variables of interest i used process. process is a set of newly established spss macros and is based on an ordinary least square regression path analysis. these macros are suitable to estimate different types of statistical models, including simple mediation and moderation models as well as more advanced moderated-mediation models (hayes 2013). i ran process model 4 and 8 (hayes 2013), which resembles a simple mediation model and an advanced moderated-mediation model. contrary to the traditional view of baron and kenny (1986) who require a significant relationship between the independent and dependent variable to test for mediation, process adopts a more contemporary approach. process establishes mediation based on the only criteria that a significant indirect effect of x on y through a mediating variable m (a x b) exists (zhao et al. 2010; hayes 2009). thus, it is not necessary to first establish a significant relationship between the x and y variables to test for a mediation effect. to assess the significance of indirect effects process uses bootstrap confidence intervals (if 0 is not included in the estimated confidence interval of the indirect effect, mediation can be inferred).  135   first, i estimated a simple mediation model (process model 4) with speed as the sole predictor. the results show that equity functions as a mediator between speed on satisfaction (effect size: 0.41, lower limit: 0.13 and upper limit: 0.69) since 0 is not include in the bootstrap confidence interval. it can be inferred that consumers indicate significantly higher satisfaction levels when the product is delivered the next day vs. in 9 days, due to higher perceived equity. this finding is in line with study 1. similarly, equity also functions as a mediator between speed and timeliness (effect size: 0.33, lower limit: 0.10 and upper limit: 0.58), availability (effect size: 0.21, lower limit: 0.08 and upper limit: 0.41), condition (effect size: 0.15, lower limit: 0.06 and upper limit: 0.26), and overall pdsq (effect size: 0.23, lower limit: 0.03 and upper limit: 0.34) indicating that consumers evaluate a retailer's pdsq significantly higher when the product is delivered the next day vs. in 9 days, due to higher perceptions of equity. based on these results, h3a is supported.   next, i estimated a simple mediation model with convenience as the sole predictor. results indicate that equity does not mediate the relationship between convenience on satisfaction (effect size: 0.25, lower limit: -0.05 and upper limit: 0.58), timeliness (effect size: 0.21, lower limit: -0.04 and upper limit: 0.48), availability (effect size: 0.13, lower limit: -0.02 and upper limit: 0.34), condition (effect size: 0.09, lower limit: -0.02 and upper limit: 0.21), or overall pdsq (effect size: 0.14, lower limit: -0.04 and upper limit: 0.33) since 0 is included in the respective bootstrap confidence intervals. thus, h3b is not supported. table 2

95% bootstrap confidence interval   furthermore, i estimated a mediation model with speed and convenience as the two predictors to test h3c and h3d. results indicate that contrary to our predictions, when recovery is slow, equity does not function as a mediator. accordingly, having the product delivered to a more convenient location does not significantly improve post-recovery satisfaction (effect size: 0.38, lower limit: -0.07 and upper limit: 0.85), timeliness (effect size: 0.31, lower limit: -0.07 and upper limit: 0.68), availability (effect size: 0.20, lower limit: -0.01 and upper limit:

supported. however, in support of h3d, our results show that when the product is delivered to a less convenient location (store), having a fast recovery does lead to significantly higher levels of satisfaction (effect size: 0.55, lower limit: 0.16 and upper limit: 0.97), 137  timeliness (effect size: 0.45, lower limit: 0.09 and upper limit: 0.81), availability (effect size: 0.29, lower limit:

the 95% bootstrap confidence interval study 2: discussion  in line with the findings of study 1, study 2 also supports that in the case of a stockout, in an omni-channel retail environment, a fast recovery plays a more important role in restoring post-recovery satisfaction and positive evaluations of a retailer's pdsq than having the unavailable product delivered to a more convenient location. the data shows that when the product is delivered to a less convenient location higher satisfaction levels and higher perceptions of a retailer's pdsq are due to higher levels of equity. moreover, higher levels of 138  equity can be achieved by providing a fast recovery. hence, it can be concluded that if a retailer does not have the capabilities to deliver the product to a more convenient location, speed might be of essence to achieving higher satisfaction levels and pdsq perceptions.  while the findings of study 2 shed some light on the importance of a fast vs. convenient recovery after a stockout, this study has its limitations. it was specifically surprising that some of the findings were contrary to the predictions based on equity theory. hence, to further contribute to theory (whetten 2009), i contextualized equity theory in study 3 by considering a different shopping context.  study 1 and subsequent study 2 implemented a low purchase criticality scenario (i.e. temporal feelings of involvement that accompany a consumer during a particular shopping situation (richins et al. 1992)) and, hence, provided only limited insights into consumers' responses to stockout recoveries. it is suggested that depending on the shopping context (i.e. low vs. high purchase criticality) consumers will evaluate an omni-channel retailer's stockout recovery strategies differently. these limitations will be addressed in study 3 by integrating a high purchase criticality scenario into the experimental design. study 3  this study introduces purchase criticality and explores the boundary conditions of the proposed model. within the context of retailing, purchase criticality or situational involvement is defined as the temporal feelings of involvement that accompany a consumer during a particular shopping situation (richins et al. 1992). extant literature has established, for example, that buying a gift for a friend results in higher purchase criticality compared to buying a product for oneself (clarke and belk 1979). also, the criticality of a purchase (i.e. whether it is needed vs. not needed) has been shown to be an important factor when assessing 139  consumer responses to stockout recovery strategies (zinn and liu 2008, 2001). accordingly, shopping situations that carry a high level of perceived risk or are, highly critical purchases are associated with higher levels of perceived consumer risk (ostrom and iacobbuci 1995).  the service failure literature provides evidence that consumers perceive a service failure as being more severe during high purchase criticality than during low purchase criticality (e.g. ostrom and iacobucci 1995; levesque and mcdougall 2009). this suggests that providing a faster and more convenient recovery from a stockout, particularly within high purchase criticality, is important to restoring equity and consequently achieving high levels of consumer satisfaction and perceptions of a retailer's pdsq.  study 3: method study 3 implemented a 2 (convenience: delivered to the home vs. to the store) x 2 (speed: next day delivery vs. 9 days delivery) between subjects design considering a high purchase criticality context. a control group with a low purchase criticality context was integrated into the experimental design. the low purchase criticality scenario asked participants to imagine they are buying a tablet for themselves whereas the high purchase criticality scenario prompted participants to imagine they are buying a tablet as a birthday gift for their spouse. a total of 274 adults from the u.s. participated in the web-based survey via amazon mechanical turk (mturk) (knemeyer and naylor 2011; goodman et al. 2013). participants were randomly assigned to one of the eight experimental conditions. the age range of the sample was from 19 to 74, with a mean age of 33.9 years, and approximately 50% of the participants were female. the median combined household income was $40,000 - $49,999, and about 90.5% reported at least some college education.  140  study 3: dependent variables and manipulation check measures the dependent variables and manipulation check measures were identical to the ones from study 1 and study 2. as a new manipulation check measure for purchase criticality, study 3 included the 20-item bipolar personal involvement inventory scale (zaichkowsky 1994). study 3: convergent and discriminant validity assessments  convergent and discriminant validity of the dependent measures was assessed through confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) using amos 22.0 for spss. a five-factor model, including satisfaction, timeliness, availability, condition, and equity was estimated. equity was estimated as a second factor model consisting of three dimensions: distributive, procedural, and interactional equity. the cfa fit statistics support our model (hu and bentler 1999): \\u03c72 = 1160.28, df = 392, cfi = 0.93, rmsea = 0.085 (90% confidence interval: 0.079; 0.090), and srmr=0.042.  in support of convergent validity the average-variance extracted (ave) for each factor exceeds 0.5 (fornell and larcker 1981). moreover, all cronbach's alpha (\\u03b1) values exceed 0.8 (nunally and bernstein 1994). in support of discriminant validity for each pair of factors, the ave exceeded the phi-square correlation (\\u02782) (fornell and larcker

manipulation checks two-way contingency table analyses were conducted to assess whether participants were aware of their respective experimental conditions (perdue and summers 1986; bachrach and bendoly 2011). the significant and large effect sizes for convenience and speed (cramer's 142  v=0.923 and 0.949), respectively are in line with prior studies and hence, confirm the validity of our experimental manipulations (miller 2002). additionally, a one-way anova was conducted to check whether there is a significant difference between the low and high purchase criticality groups. the results indicate that the high purchase criticality condition leads to higher purchase criticality evaluations (mhigh_criticality = 5.56) than the low purchase criticality condition (mlow_criticality = 5.17) with f(1,273) = 14.55 , p < 0.01, \\u03b72 = 0.05. study 3: analysis and results  i replicated the analysis of study 2, to assess whether the predictions in terms of speed and convenience on

and upper limit: 0.77), condition (effect size: 0.33, lower limit: 0.12 and upper limit: 0.58), and overall pdsq (effect size: 0.50, lower limit: 0.16 and upper limit: 0.78) since 0 is not included in both bootstrap confidence intervals. this finding is in line with the predictions but contrary to the findings considering a low purchase criticality context. thus, h3b is supported considering a high purchase criticality context.  furthermore, i estimated a mediation model with speed and convenience as the two predictors to test h3c and h3d. in line with the predictions, the results indicate that when recovery is slow, equity does function as a mediator. hence, having the product delivered to a more convenient location does significantly improve post-recovery satisfaction (effect size: 0.97, lower limit: 0.36 and upper limit: 1.62), timeliness (effect size: 0.80, lower limit: 0.25 and upper limit: 1.36), availability (effect size: 0.70, lower limit: 0.26 and upper limit: 1.29), condition (effect size: 0.51, lower limit: 0.17 and upper limit: 0.93), and overall pdsq (effect size: 0.69, lower limit: 0.28 and upper limit: 1.26) due to higher equity perceptions. thus, h3c is supported considering a high purchase criticality context. in support of h3d, the results show that when the product is delivered to a less convenient location (store), having a fast recovery does lead to significantly higher levels of satisfaction (effect size: 1.37, lower limit: 0.76 and upper limit: 1.97), timeliness (effect size: 1.13, lower limit: 0.66 and 145  upper limit: 1.65), availability (effect size: 0.98, lower limit: 0.56 and upper limit: 1.56), condition (effect size: 0.72, lower limit: 0.43 and upper limit: 1.11), and overall pdsq (effect size: 0.97, lower limit: 0.55 and upper limit: 1.39) due to higher perceptions of equity.  study 3: discussion  study 3 highlights the importance of the shopping context (i.e. purchase criticality) when recovering from a stockout. the results provide insights into the appropriateness of using equity theory to investigate stockout recovery. while in study 2, which considered a low purchase criticality context, not all findings followed the predictions according to equity theory but when, considering a high purchase criticality context the results were in line with the predictions (study 3). thus, equity theory seems to be a better theoretical lens to predict consumer responses to failure recovery when purchase criticality is high. in addition, it seems to be more important to consider recovery attributes as bundles of recovery resources under a high purchase criticality context and its associated higher risk (smith et al. 1999). while having the product delivered to a more convenient location vs. a less convenient location the data did not evidence significantly improve satisfaction or pdsq levels when the recovery speed was low considering a low purchase criticality context. however, in a high purchase criticality convenience does have a significant and positive effect on satisfaction and pdsq levels.  general discussion and implications  when considered as a whole, the three studies offer interesting insights especially pertaining to the role that equity plays in affecting post-recovery satisfaction and consumer 146  evaluations of a retailer's pdsq. while the findings of this research, in general, indicate that consumers are more likely to have positive post-recovery satisfaction levels and evaluations of a retailer's pdsq due to higher perceptions of equity after a stockout, this might only apply to specific cases. in study 2 (low purchase criticality) i showed that, in general, equity mediates the relationship between a fast recovery and satisfaction and consumer perceptions of a retailer's pdsq. however, in a low purchase criticality context, the data did not indicate convenience would enhance satisfaction levels and perceptions of pdsq when the recovery is slow, which was contrary to the predictions based on equity theory. this suggests that convenience plays a less important role in affecting post-recovery consumer perceptions in a low purchase criticality context. also, in a low purchase criticality context and with its associated low risk, simply providing a fast recovery might be evaluated as \\\"fair\\\" enough leading to higher satisfaction levels and perceptions of pdsq. however, in the case of a high purchase criticality context which is associated with high risk, retailers should invest more effort in the recovery process by considering speed and convenience as a bundle of resources for the recovery process. taken together the studies provide insights under which conditions equity serves as an important driver and thus, highlights how consumers perceive specific omni-channel fulfillment attributes when utilized to recover from a stockout situation. theoretical implications and future research this research makes several important contributions to the literature (see table 7 for a summary). this manuscript spans the research areas of operations and marketing by investigating how omni-channel fulfillment operations can impact consumer perceptions. specifically, through a series of experiments i highlight the importance of a retailer's omni-channel fulfillment operations for service recovery within an omni-channel retail environment. 147  more precisely, i show how omni-channel fulfillment operations can be used to recover from a stockout situation. thus, this research specifically contributes to the growing literature stream associated with consumer issues in operations and supply chain management, which stresses the importance of operations management in creating end-consumer value (flint and mentzer 2006).  table 7: summary of contributions to the literature current literature contribution to the literature call for more integrated investigations of managerial processes in both marketing and operations/supply chain management (e.g. esper et al. 2010; stank et al. 2012; j\\u00fcttner et al. 2007). provides insights for stockout recovery situations and highlights the importance of research at the intersection of operations/supply chain management and marketing. research investigates behavioral responses to service failures more generally (e.g. kelley 1993, roggeven 2012). considers pdsq as an outcome variable to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how various consumer market segments perceive a retailers omni-channel fulfillment operations in the case of a stockout recovery.  provides a deeper understanding of the role omni-channel fulfillment operations for a service failure recovery. consumer response to out-of-stock research has predominantly focused on single channel retailing (e.g. zinn and liu 2001, 2008, peinkofer et al. 2015). extends the consumer response to out-of-stock literature by considering the new omni-channel environment.                                                     equity theory has been shown to be appropriate to study service failure recovery in marketing (e.g. grewal et al. 2008; smith et al. 1999; roggeveen et al. 2012).  provides evidence for the suitability of equity theory to explore stockout recovery. identifies a boundary condition of equity theory since the theory is does only explain higher satisfaction and positive evaluations of a retailer's pdsq for specific \\\"bundles\\\" of recovery attributes.   from a theoretical perspective, i was able to show that equity is the driving force behind restoring post-recovery satisfaction levels and achieving positive consumer perceptions 148  of a retailer's pdsq. more specifically, i was able to show that depending on the bundle of recovery attributes and the shopping context, equity might or might not be the driving force impacting consumers' post-recovery evaluations. consumers are likely to evaluate different recovery strategies as being more or less \\\"fair\\\". supported by the findings of this research, some recovery strategies do not significantly impact consumers' fairness perceptions and hence, their satisfaction and evaluations of a retailer's pdsq. for example, i failed to show that equity mediates the relationship between convenience on satisfaction and pdsq when purchase criticality is low. in addition, purchase criticality may present a boundary condition of equity theory and future research is needed to firmly establish these boundary conditions. for example, future research should explore why equity theory seems to be more appropriate when explaining consumer responses to stockout recovery when the purchase criticality is high. conversely, research is also needed to better understand why in a low purchase criticality convenience does not have a significant impact on satisfaction levels and pdsq evaluations. additionally, this research contributes to the literature that investigates how consumers respond to stockouts. historically, this body of work has exclusively focused on exploring consumer responses to stockouts in a single channel setting (e.g. zinn and liu 2008; pizzi and scarpi 2013). however, with the emergence of omni-channel retailing, firms now have new options in how they handle stockouts. this research extends the current understandings of consumer responses to stockouts by considering supply chain focused psychological variables in an omni-channel retail context. specifically, by introducing pdsq as an outcome variable, this study further enhances prior research investigating how consumers evaluate a retailer's pdsq capabilities to the contextual setting of a stockout recovery. 149   while considering supply chain-focused psychological variables provides insight into how consumers evaluate an omni-channel retailer's fulfillment operations, it does not provide insights into actual consumer behaviors. thus, future research should integrate actual consumer behaviors to see how stockout recovery strategies influence other important variables, such as shopping frequency and average money spent on subsequent shopping trips.  furthermore, this research considered how omni-channel retailers can leverage recovery attributes from a stockout in a brick-and-mortar environment and thus, the findings might not be generalizable to online stockouts. since stockouts are also likely to occur within the online retail environment, future research should investigate which recovery attributes are most effective to recover from an online stockout. for consumers experiencing a stockout in a brick-and-mortar store a fast recovery seems to be essential in improving satisfaction levels but consumers experiencing an online stockout might prefer different recovery attributes and evaluate a fast recovery as less important since they were already willing to wait for the product to be shipped.  however, this research only considered two different recovery attributes (speed and convenience). based on prior findings (forrester research, inc. 2014), recovery strategies that rely on shipping products tend to increase costs. this additional cost needs to be considered when developing and implementing a stockout recovery strategy. therefore, future research should incorporate other important recovery attributes to allow a better assessment of how consumers evaluate an omni-channel retailer's recovery efforts.   in addition, esper et al. (2003) find that online consumer satisfaction levels might also be impacted by the selection of the 3pl carrier. hence, future research might also want to 150  incorporate how brick-and-mortar consumers evaluate a retailers' stockout recovery efforts based on the carrier selection delivering the product. managerial implications within the omni-channel retail environment, consumers' expectations around a retailer's omni-channel capabilities are steadily increasing (forrester research, inc. 2014). 45% of consumers indicate that in the case of a stockout they would very likely take advantage of having the unavailable product shipped to their home; however, only 21% indicated that they would be willing to have it shipped to the store (forrester research, inc. 2014). it is important for managers to understand that not all recovery efforts are evaluated by consumers equally and will lead to positive post-recovery satisfaction levels. managers need to gain an understanding of the recovery attributes that are most valued by their consumers in order to increase consumer satisfaction and evaluations of their pdsq post-stockout. thus, manager could use the insights from this research to determine which recovery strategies might be evaluated by their consumers as \\\"fair\\\" to ensure that after a stockout occurs and consumers experience dissatisfaction, satisfaction levels can be improved through offering the appropriate recovery strategy.  also, big data and data analytics play an important role in implementing efficient and effective omni-channel fulfillment operations (ferguson 2013). for example, massey's professional outfitters was able to improve its efficiency and customer service by consolidating all its data from various channels into one platform (berthiaume 2015). managers can now leverage insights from big data and predictive analytics to anticipate which consumers are in need (high purchase criticality) or not in need (low purchase criticality) for a product. the tools to make predictions about consumers' purchase are emerging. for example, 151  target was able to use consumer buying data to predict whether a female consumer was pregnant (duhigg 2012). knowing this type of information enables managers to adjust their stockout recovery strategy based on the consumers' shopping context, ensuring that the \\\"best\\\" recovery strategy is offered and post-recovery satisfaction levels are achieved.  for managers, this research shows that providing a fast stockout recovery is key in achieving higher post-recovery satisfaction levels and consumer perceptions of a retailer's pdsq. hence, managers should prioritize their investments and developments in terms of their omni-channel fulfillment capabilities to offer a fast stockout recovery. omni-channel retailers could develop a ship-from-store program to provide online consumers who experience a stockout with the desired product in a timely manner. for instance, in early 2013, macy's announced that it would be dedicating an additional 200 stores by the end of the year for the purpose of fulfilling online orders (ryan 2014). and, in fact, 57% of retailers cite a shorter delivery time to customers as the most important reason for why these retailers would develop a ship-from-store program (forrester, inc. 2014).       152

for successful retail supply chain management. by considering three different echelons in the supply chain (supplier, retailer, and consumer) and employing different methodological approaches each essay by itself provided interesting insights and contributions. however, taken as a whole, several grand findings and contributions of this dissertation to understanding omni-channel fulfillment operations emerged.    in a grand scheme this dissertation provides evidence that across the supply chain the impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations are mixed but interconnected. while some supply chain members (i.e. retailers and end-consumers) seem to benefit from omni-channel fulfillment operations overall, other supply chain members (i.e. suppliers) seem to be facing significant operational challenges. for example, in essay one, i was able to establish that at least some retailers financially and operationally benefit from omni-channel fulfillment operations, furthermore, i showed that end-consumers and their individual shopping context also play an important role when investigating omni-channel fulfillment operations and should not be neglected. specifically, this research revealed that, in the case of a stockout recovery, the perception of \\\"fairness\\\" is a driver of positive consumer evaluations of a retailer's omni-channel fulfillment capabilities. however, essay two highlights the potential operational challenges that suppliers might experience when establishing omni-channel fulfillment capabilities.  future research might therefore wish to explore another aspect of omni-channel fulfillment operations which spans across different members of the supply chain to further strengthen the mixed impacts. for example, it would be interesting to uncover how omni-161  channel returns management will impact the different supply chain members. while consumers might perceive a retailers omni-channel return capabilities as positive, retailers and suppliers alike might struggle with developing the appropriate processes leading to new tensions and operational challenges in the reverse retail supply chain.  in addition, this research indicates that it is essential for supply chain members to become operationally ambidextrous to succeed in the omni-channel retail environment. this research supports the notion that retailers and suppliers refine already established fulfillment operations while simultaneously establishing new fulfillment operations. in the case of the retailers, i was able to provide evidence that depending on the retail segment, retailers appear to demonstrate positive financial and operational performance outcomes due to being operationally ambidextrous. in a similar vein, suppliers also exhibit operationally ambidextrous tendencies. within the context of drop-shipping, suppliers will refine existing operational activities while simultaneously developing new drop-shipping operations. hence, this dissertation provides evidence of the existence and necessity of operational ambidexterity in two different research settings. this dissertation opens up the dialogue for more exploration of the operational ambidexterity phenomenon. the phenomenon is fairly new in the operations and supply chain management domain and has only received very limited attention. future research will be necessary to shed even more light on the relationship of operational ambidexterity and performance. specifically, future research might further investigate its impact on operational performance. while this research introduced operational performance as a new outcome variable, the statistical support was rather weak. thus, future research might focus on studying when a firm might gain operational efficiencies from becoming operationally ambidextrous 162  and when not. thus, specifically longitudinal research designs might be appropriate for future research endeavors. building on the previous conversation, this dissertation also highlights that operational ambidexterity and the impacts thereof are more nuanced. for retailers, i was able to identify that the respective retail segments and their associated environmental characteristics play an important role for the potential positive impacts of operational ambidexterity on retail firm performance. also, the availability of resources appeared to constitute an interesting boundary condition. in addition, from a more internal perspective drop-shipping volume might constitute a boundary condition specifically as it relates to how to manage operational ambidexterity. hence, environmental factors and other firm characteristics may constitute important boundary conditions and warrant further exploration to gain a better understanding. it might be interesting to apply this research to other retail specific contexts and even other industries which are characterized by their individual environments. also, more research is needed to better understand how operational ambidexterity is managed. while this research offers some new insights concerning the debate of structural integration or separation future research might consider additional conditions when it is more beneficial to structurally integrate or separate. this type of extension would allow to uncover additional nuances of the impacts of operational ambidexterity.  moreover, this dissertation provides a more theoretical understanding of operational ambidexterity. while the limited operational ambidexterity literature has addressed the phenomenon from the perspective of theory testing, this dissertation employed an exploratory perspective to contribute to the understanding how operational ambidexterity is reached and managed. specifically, this dissertation indicates that exploration needs to be \\\"triggered\\\" by an 163  external event and that exploration eventually turns into exploitation. however, this finding is specific to the context of suppliers and drop-shipping and might differ depending on other contexts or supply chain members. future research might for example focus on gaining more theoretical insights by focusing on retailers. retailers are standing under the continuous pressure of meeting end-consumer expectations and hence, might exhibit a different patter of how to manage operational ambidexterity. lastly, this dissertation stresses the importance of how operational activities create value to end-consumers. the literature only recently gained traction on considering the value that operations and supply chain management activities has on end-consumers. this notion will gain even more importance within the omni-channel retail environment, where not only retailers but also suppliers stand in direct contact with end-consumers. in particular, this dissertation highlights how different attributes (speed and convenience) of omni-channel fulfillment operations can lead to positive consumer evaluations in the case of a stockout recovery. thus, this research contributes to the evolving dialogue on how consumer insights provide valuable insights for retail supply chain strategy.  more research is needed in the future to gain a better and more nuanced understanding of the value that consumer insights offer to retail supply chain strategy. this is especially important considering that supply chains are perceived to be consumer driven. therefore, future research should explore additional supply chain and operations management activities and how these may create end-consumer value. for example, it might be interesting to investigate how omni-channel return management activities impact consumers.   164  vi. appendix                             165          166   \",\n",

bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  2  introduction a growing number of traditional store-based retailers are becoming multi-channel retailers by opening an additional online-channel to offer their customers multiple ways of buying and interaction. at the same time, former pure online-retailers are opening stores or physical pick-up points to allow their customers physical interaction and product pick-up. multi-channel retailing got primary attention principally in the field of multi-channel marketing (e.g. wirtz, 2008). marketing literature and scholarly research address multi-channel marketing mainly focusing on customer behavior on the one side (e.g. venkatesan et al, 2007) and the conflicts between channels on the other side (e.g. falk et al, 2007; avery et al, 2009). several authors (e.g. schr\\u00f6der, 2005; schobesberger, 2007; heinemann 2008, 2009) analyze different multi-channel strategies and implications on a retailers' marketing mix.  whereas operational implications of online retailing have received attention since the end of the 1990s (e.g. turban et al, 2009; swaminathan & tayur, 2003), specific analysis of operational implications of multi-channel retailing remains scarce. agatz et al (2008) reviewed the specific supply chain management issues of internet fulfillment in a multi-channel environment. they identified an important number of topics relevant for e-fulfillment, but recognized that there are only very few dedicated models on multi-channel retailing.  multi-channel retailers with different business models are using different fulfillment systems to deliver the products to their customers: the online shop of the french retailer fnac (cultural and electronics products), fnac.com, started its online activity completely separated from its store activity, with different warehouse locations and fulfillment organizations. they gradually integrated their logistics activities and are operating today a fully integrated warehouse, preparing deliveries for the stores as well as for the individual online customers. tesco.com, the online shop of the major uk retailer tesco, prepares the customer's orders exclusively in the tesco store next to the customer (smith & sparks, 2009). so does monoprix.fr, the online shop of the french city-center supermarket chain monoprix. these observations suggest that a specific multi-channel business model may induce a specific, most suitable fulfillment system. if this is the case, it should then be possible to evaluate how a fulfillment system fits a given business model.  rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  3  from an operational point of view, fulfillment systems have to be mainly time- and cost-efficient. from a strategic marketing point of view, the fulfillment system has to be able to meet the customers' expectations created by the chosen business model. we therefore propose to develop a qualitative framework to evaluate how a specific multi-channel fulfillment system matches the business model of multi-channel retailers both in terms of the expectations of their customers on the one hand and the economic performances on the other hand. this framework should serve as basis for further empirical studies. our paper is organized in two parts: in the first part, we will highlight the main characteristics of multi-channel retailing and present the major elements of the retailers' strategy, the retail mix, which have to be adapted to a multi-channel retailing strategy. 1 we then will explore the specific operational challenges to be faced when operating a multi-channel activity.  this first part will be completed with the presentation of the five major multi-channel fulfillment systems used to deliver products to the customers. in the second part, we will propose a qualitative analysis framework in order to evaluate the overall performance of a given fulfillment system, combining the two dimensions 'customer expectations' and 'economic performance'. the parameters of the framework as well as its applications will be based on the analysis of the strategic and operational challenges developed in the first part. applying the analysis framework to the five major fulfillment systems leads us to discuss how each of the systems impacts the different parameters. we conclude our paper presenting managerial implications and suggested future research avenues to provide evidence if our framework is valid for our purpose.  methodology our analysis is based on the one hand on our longitudinal industry observation of retailers' practices, completed with the analysis of company information and press articles. moreover,                                                  1 in our paper, we will concentrate on multi-channel retailers operating at least several physical stores and an online sales channel under the same brand and with the same types of products. moreover, we focus on the distribution of physical products, as dematerialized products do not need a physical distribution. we exclude as well specific configurations (which may nonetheless be dominant in particular sectors), like delivery from manufacturers or 'complex assortments' (de koster, 2002) with bulky items and temperature sensitive goods. rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  4  we conducted a series of interviews with french and uk senior operations managers and consultants in the retail sector. this observation allowed us to identify five major multi-channel fulfillment systems. to be able to evaluate these fulfillment systems regarding the two dimensions 'economic performance' and 'customer expectations', we have to identify the relevant parameters to integrate into our proposed framework. to do so, we analyzed marketing and operations general literature and scholarly research. exploration of the main strategy elements and operational challenges suggests number of parameters, indicating economic performance and customer expectations. we completed the identified parameters for evaluating customer expectations with dimensions from the servqual and netqual scales, measuring service quality perception from the customers. these parameters of our framework will be the dependent parameters, whereas the analyzed fulfillment systems will be the independent parameters. the exploration of the strategy factors and economic performances in the first part will allow us to apply the framework to the different fulfillment models by assessing the chosen performance parameters for each of the fulfillment systems. this shall provide a global evaluation for the each of the analyzed fulfillment systems.  strategy factors in multi-channel retailing the objective of this chapter is to summarize the context of multi-channel retailing as well as the main drivers for customer expectations and economic performances, which will enable us to identify the relevant parameters to use in our proposed framework. we will first present the main characteristics of multi-channel retailing. we then will investigate how the business model of a multi-channel retailer, characterized by different elements of the retail mix, will have to be adapted to a multi-channel strategy. an exploration of the major operational challenges for a multi-channel retailer will conclude this chapter.  multi-channel retailing: characteristics & customer behavior worldwide retailing is still dominated by the traditional store retailing, as 95% of food retailing and 80% of non-food retailing is realized through physical store-based retailers (dioux & dupuis, 2009), and online channels still represent only a small part of the total sales of the retailers. nevertheless, the motivation to open online sales-channels is strong due to the fact that e-commerce is realizing important annual turnover growth rates of about 30% for the rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  5  last few years, whilst most other retail forms stay stable or even decline. it is therefore interesting for a store retailer to invest in the creation of an additional online sales channel.  to implement a multi-channel strategy, retailers have to decide how to adapt their business model by adjusting the elements of the retail mix. at the same time, they have to face and resolve numerous operational challenges. in multi-channel retailing, customers expect at least the same level of service, counsel, and information on every channel (cf. heinemann, 2008). they expect to have identical customer loyalty programs across all channels, to be able to pay and pick up in the shop a product ordered on the web site, or to be able to return and exchange a product bought on the web in a store (berman & thelen, 2004). this channel hopping, which is a legitimate desire from a customer's point of view, may nevertheless prove to be very difficult to implement for the retailer (vanheems, 2009). at the same time, online shoppers transfer their perception and experiences from a physical store to the website of the same brand and vice versa. customers tend to transpose a bad experience in one channel to the other channels of the same distributor (heinemann, 2008). as soon as their expectations are not fulfilled, they may adapt their purchasing habits, in the worst case stop buying with this retailer at all. it is therefore vital for a multi-channel retailer to make sure that every channel always meets the same level of expectations of the customers.  multi-channel retail mix  the retail mix consists of the mix of variables, including geographical location, merchandising, communication, price, services, product range and the personnel, which form the overall strategic marketing components of a retailing activity. it is the right mix of all these factors which determines if a retail concept is viable and successful. compared to a store retailer, the online sales channel is not only a new channel, but rather a new business model, where experiences from the traditional (brick and mortar) store channel may not be valid any more (heinemann, 2008). decisive success factors in a store like store location, sales personnel and material management in the shop are not the same success factors in an online sales channel. retailers which decide to open an e-commerce activity beside their existing store sales channel have to make sure that the co-existence of the two sales channels is working well. they have to decide how to adapt the different elements of the retail mix to each channel, rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  6  which product strategy to chose, which prices to apply, how to maintain a consistent image across the channels or what role to assign to each channel, to name a few (cf. berman & evans, 2009). we will briefly describe the major issues of some of the most important variables of the retail mix, assessing their relevance and importance in the store, the online channel and the multi-channel strategy. product mix the product mix is the major variable determining the activity of a retailer. it establishes if a retailer is specialized in selected product categories or a generalist. if a store based retailer opens an additional online channel, he has to decide which product mix he offers on this new channel. he can offer the identical product mix, a combination or part of his existing product mix or a completely different additional product mix on the new channel. location of the stores a physical store's success is to a great extend influenced by its location. in order to determine if the location can attract the store's target customers, a store based retailer has to analyze socioeconomic data, transport access, mix of competitors, costs and regulation issues. these parameters, decisive for a physical store, have generally no influence on a pure online sales channel, as access to the websites is independent from a geographical location. in a multi-channel strategy, however, the store location remains important; the density of the store network can be an important factor for offering store pick-up, returns and after sales services in the stores for their online customers. pricing the pricing policy applied in a store may take into consideration the environment of the store (socioeconomic characteristics of the geographical catchment area) and the price levels of the local competitors. such a local pricing policy which can be applied in a store is incompatible with the global price transparency in an online channel and the exposure to price comparisons. the pricing policy of a multi-channel retailer encounters specific difficulties: the global price transparency on the internet, the specific cost structures of the store and the online channel, rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  7  the existence of specific offers and the different means of payment render it difficult to apply a consistent pricing policy across all channels. especially the price transparency makes it difficult for a retailer to offer different prices for the same product on different sales channels. service, store pick-up and return a multi-channel service offer can be composed of special delivery options (delivery speed, delivery timing, information on order status), the exchange policy, return policy, refunding, after sales service, payment options and consumer credits. multi-channel retailers can offer either to deliver the order to the customer's home or to let the customer pick-up the order in one of the stores. this service allows the customer to pick up the order whenever he likes, even sooner than with home delivery.2 allowing customers in-store return or exchange can avoid the cost and time of returning via mail. at the same time, this offers an important possibility for the retailer to create a personal contact between the client and the sales personnel to increase customer loyalty and to generate additional sales. personnel the sales personnel play a decisive role in stores. they welcome clients, provide counsel and advice and can influence sales. their behavior and attitude contribute in an important way to the atmosphere and ambiance of the store and its concept.  this important parameter in a store is irrelevant in a pure online channel, except for telephone hotline contacts or the delivery service personnel. in a multi-channel strategy, however, the store personnel have to be able to orient and counsel the client using different channels. it is very important for the client not to perceive any differences or barriers between the channels.  operational challenges of multi-channel retailing in general, the operational organization of a retailer is mainly focused on efficient store replenishment, lowering costs and shortening the product turnover time.                                                  2 in case of unavailable items, the retailer can chose to send the missing items directly to the customer and only reserve the available items in the store for pick-up. in this case, the customer experience will be negative, as the customer's decision to pick up his order in the store can't be fulfilled.   rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  8  to offer an online channel to its customers, a retailer has to be able to manage its operations in a very different way from its physical store activity. e-fulfillment may be considered as one of the most expensive and critical operations of internet retailers (de koster, 2002), logistics and stock management becoming core competencies (benghozi, 2001). keeping stock of a high number of different references, making it available, picking and packing, sending and delivering quickly at a low cost are the numerous constraints to respect. in the following, we will present and discuss the main operational issues, which are decisive for the overall performance of the multi-channel retailing. product availability product availability is one of the most important parameters for customer satisfaction (browne, 2009). a store customer usually can compare the products present in the store. availability is indicated through the simple presence of a product in the store shelve. a customer can ask the sales personnel if there is any stock of the product or when it will be available again. an online client needs to have all this information indicated on the website together with the product information. the online channel offers the possibility to display the remaining stock of a chosen product, or even, in a multi-channel context, the remaining stock and the location of the store where the product is available for testing, purchasing or withdrawal. displaying the availability of products or the delay of their replacement is an important marketing tool impacting the sales and influencing customer satisfaction.  stock keeping stores usually receive deliveries either directly from the manufacturer or from one or several logistics platforms with either warehousing or cross-docking function. as online orders may consist of different products, composing the orders from different warehouse locations may prove to be difficult and inefficient in terms of cost and delivery time. a central warehouse and fulfillment center may therefore, at a first view, be more adapted to the online channel. however, multi-channel retailers may as well pick the items for an online order directly in the stores. for an online order, the retailer has some flexibility where from he delivers the products to his customers, as he can use multiple stock locations and therefore offer a wider product range than the one contained in a single warehouse, as multiple channels may share their rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  9  inventories. in-store inventories can therefore be available for online customers' orders (agatz et al, 2008). centralizing stock allows easier monitoring of the stock levels for different products. if a retailer is serving its online clients (totally or partially) from stock in the stores, the overall stock level on these different locations is difficult to monitor. this is the same problem for multi-channel retailers who offer the possibility to their customers to order online and withdraw the product in a nearby store. as information on product availability is a crucial parameter for the customers buying decision, the accuracy of the stock level information is very important. order taking and fulfillment in an online channel, the customer enters the type and number of products he wants to acquire and enters the payment information (usually done by credit cards), the online channel therefore becomes a self-service channel (falk et al, 2007). all this information entered by the customer triggers the order preparation and fulfillment process. retailers once delivering their stores from centralized distribution centers (often with complete boxes or pallets) have to re-think the way orders are prepared, as their organizations are not designed for small individual customers' orders. they must therefore be reorganized to treat these orders (de koster, 2002), implementing a process of single item picking and packing. as mentioned above, another option for the retailer is to pick the items in the stores, where the products are available on the shelves, and to prepare the order in the shops. furthermore, orders may be consolidated from multiple stock locations (for example from a warehouse and a store), which needs a specific process. the more complex the fulfilment process is organized, the more difficult it becomes to respect the quality and efficiency of this process. delivery to the customer besides the availability of the product, the different delivery options for a product are an important parameter for the online channel client. different delivery service levels offered like delivery in 24 hours, delivery to a pick-up point, national post service etc. are becoming a product differentiation factor of the retailer. rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  10  delivery to the customers' homes, which is a distinctive element of an online channel, implies to deal with cost and organizational issues. the usually small transactions have to be managed and delivered in an efficient way, while respecting the promised delivery timing. the costs of the home delivery can be totally or partially paid by the customer. this becomes an important parameter of choice for the client, as no direct delivery costs appear in the store channel. on the other hand, the costs of delivery can be used as a marketing tool for special offers (\\\"your next order free of charge\\\") or minimum order amounts (\\\"delivery free of charge for every order above 100 euros\\\"). delivery becomes therefore a service parameter, a price parameter and a promotional parameter. reverse logistic store customers can usually see, touch and try the goods before purchasing. returns are limited and very often linked to an exchange of the product, where the returned product is put back into the shelves. defect products are reimbursed. as online customers cannot see, touch and try the products, online retailers usually offer good conditions for the customer to return the products they don't like (due to legal and regulatory obligations, but as well as part of their customer service offer).  return handling must be quick in the eyes of the customers, either to get a product exchange or to get reimbursed and the customer account re-credited. the process must as well be efficient as it is a very manual process and impacts the stock management of the returned products (min et al, 2006). a physical store channel can be an easy way in the customer's eyes to return the products. multi-channel fulfillment systems  to operate the multi-channel strategy, retailers have to set up a fulfillment system to deliver products to the customers. this fulfillment system, organizing the process from order intake to delivery to the customer, has to match the business model and to reply to the operational challenges. industry players are using different fulfillment systems, and several authors suggest typologies of fulfillment schemes, focusing on the locus of order preparation (de koster, 2002; durand, 2008). multi-channel retailing per se intends to offer the clients the choice where and how to order and where and how to get the products delivered. rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  11  the major choice for the client is to shop in the store or shop online. if shopping online, the client can furthermore opt for delivery at home or pick up his products in one of the retailer's stores.  the retailer has to set up a fulfillment system able to respect the client's choice of the delivery mode, either by creating a new logistics infrastructure, or using the existing one, by adapting the existing processes. in order to be able to analyze the fulfillment systems from a customer expectation's perspective, we decided to distinguish the fulfillment systems by the delivery option chosen by the customer: clients may either choose the direct home delivery for their purchases completed on the online channel or choose to pick up their purchased items in a physical store of the retailer. this in-store pick-up is a delivery option only multi-channel retailers can offer and which may be chosen to 30-40% of the customers at some multi-channel retailers (berman & thelen, 2004). a client going into a store in order to buy a product, searches, compares, picks the product out of the shelve and pays the product. single-channel store shoppers may therefore not be affected by the multi-channel fulfillment organization. 1. direct home delivery direct home delivery can be completed either by the retailer's own delivery organization, a delivery logistics provider or via an external pick-up point network3. before entering in this 'delivery pipeline', products have to be picked, prepared, packed and expedited, which can be done either in a central warehouse or distribution center, in a store, or in multiple locations (central warehouse and one or more stores).                                                   3 we consider a delivery via an external pick-up-point network (usually neighborhood shops linked to a network which offers the retreat of parcels for the clients of different retailers) like a home delivery, as the fulfillment process is quite identical, with a delivery of (sometimes pre-sorted) parcels to the pick-up point network's injection hub. although this is influencing the ease of access, this way of delivery cannot provide a contact with the retailer as in his own store.  rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  12  1.1 direct delivery from central warehouse  picking, preparation and packing of ordered items can be done from a central warehouse stocking the products (figure 1.1). this central warehouse can either be a purpose-built entity to serve exclusively the online channel or the existing warehouse for the store operations (in which case the processes in the warehouse have to be adapted).  1.2 direct delivery from a store  picking, preparation and packing of the ordered items can be done inside a physical store out of the shelves. in this case, operators pick the products into a specific order preparation cart from the shelves and then pack and send the completed order to the customer (figure 1.2).   1.3 direct delivery after multi-stock consolidation  if the desired articles of an order are not available in one place, picking of the ordered items has to be done in a central warehouse as well as inside a physical store from the shelves. the picked items have then to be consolidated, prepared and packed in one site (figure 1.3). in some cases, the multichannel  figure 1.1: direct delivery from central warehouse figure 1.2: direct delivery from a store figure 1.3: direct delivery after multi-stock consolidation rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  13  retailer may opt for sending the order in two different parcels, to avoid the costs and delay of the consolidation.  2 client pick-up in the store a customer ordering online may choose to pick up his products in one of the retailer's stores. in this case, products have to be picked, prepared, packed and kept ready for pick-up in the store. 2.1 direct in-store order preparation  if all the products of the customer's order are available in the store chosen by the customer to pick-up, the picking, preparation and packing of the order can be done immediately in the store (figure 2.1).     2.2 in-store order consolidation from multiple stocks  if some of the products of the customer's order are not available in the store chosen by the customer for pick-up, the unavailable items must be ordered from the central warehouse (or other stores) to complete the order. the preparation and packing of the order can be done only after consolidation of all items in the store (figure 2.2). (a specific case of this in-store order consolidation can be a complete order  preparation in a central warehouse sent to the store only to be picked up by the customer, without further adding any product in the store).  figure 2.1: direct in-store order-preparation figure 2.2: in-store order consolidation from multiple stocks rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  14  the analysis framework in this part, we will first determine the parameters to integrate in our proposed framework. we then will apply this framework to the five abovementioned fulfillment systems and discuss the results. we will conclude this part discussing the limitations of the framework, suggestions for further research and managerial implications.  customer expectations and economic performance having analyzed the main strategy factors and operational challenges, and identified the five major fulfillment systems, we now have to determine the parameters to include into our proposed framework in order to evaluate these fulfillment systems. the different fulfillment systems lead to different levels of complexity, of costs and of product availability and therefore different levels of customer satisfaction and economic performance. to explore how a fulfillment system fits a given business model, we have to evaluate the overall performance of the different multi-channel fulfillment systems, combining the two angles of analysis:  on the one hand, we analyze to which extend a given fulfillment system is able to meet the customer expectations. on the other hand, we analyze the economic performance of each model. in our proposed framework, we will confront the different fulfillment systems to several parameters which are relevant for the customer expectations and the economic performance. the fulfillment systems may be considered as the independent variables of our analysis, whereas the different parameters of our framework represent the dependent variables. the identification of these parameters results from the exploration of the main strategy elements and operational challenges. concerning the economic performances of fulfillment, we propose to assess different dimensions of the overall fulfillment efficiency, combining widely used indicators to describe logistics and fulfillment performances (e.g. in agatz et al, 2008): \\u2010 stock efficiency (indicating reliable sales forecasts and optimized product replenishment to reduce stock-risk, capability of monitoring stock levels across different stock locations and the capability of balancing stock between different locations) \\u2010 picking efficiency (indicating efficient organization of stock and picking zones for picking and order preparation) rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  15  \\u2010 delivery cost efficiency (indicating the total cost of delivery from the stock(s) to the customers' home or to the desired store for pick-up) \\u2010 channel organization efficiency (indicating the information exchange between sales channels and real time availability of data) \\u2010 fulfillment infrastructure costs (indicating the necessary investments, rents or outsourcing costs for the fulfillment infrastructure) \\u2010 return handling efficiency (indicating the speed and quality of the return handling process, from product reception to exchange or reimbursement for the client)  analysis in the first part of this paper suggests three parameters indicating the customer expectations: \\u2010 product availability (indicating the availability of the desired products) \\u2010 speed of delivery (indicating the time between the order placement and the reception of the products by the customers) \\u2010 ease of access and return of products (indicating the ease for a client either to get the products delivered/to pick them up or to return/exchange the products received) in order to assess more precisely how a fulfillment system corresponds to the customer expectations, we completed these parameters with parameters from the servqual framework, developed by parasuraman et al (1988) to measure service quality. nevertheless, this traditional service quality may not be applicable in an online environment (parasuraman et al, 2005). bressolles (2006) developed the netqual framework to specifically assess electronic service quality.  as multi-channel retailing provides both 'traditional' and 'online' service experiences, we have to combine these two approaches in order to identify all the relevant dimensions to customer expectations and retain only those which may be directly impacted by the fulfilment model.  therefore, we selected the following dimensions out of the servqual and netqual scales for our analysis: \\u2010 quality and quantity of information (netqual) (indicating the availability and correctness of the information provided in terms of product availability, stock level, delivery times etc. either on the website or in the stores)  rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  16  \\u2010 reliability and respect of commitments (servqual & netqual) (indicating the ability to deliver the products in terms of quantity, price, description and timing) \\u2010 offer (netqual) (indicating the lengths and the width of the product range available on the different channels) \\u2010 assurance (servqual) (indicating the competence and friendliness of the personnel usually in the store for buying, pick-up and exchange transactions of the client).  we did not retain those dimensions having only an indirect link with the fulfillment systems. these elements constitute the analysis framework we propose to analyze the overall performance of specific fulfillment systems. application of the analysis framework  we are now able to apply this proposed framework to the five identified fulfillment systems according to our objective to evaluate the fit between a multi-channel retailer's business model and a specific fulfillment system. to be able to analyze each of the abovementioned fulfillment systems, we will explore the sensitivity of each of the parameters regarding the main characteristics of the different fulfillment systems.4 we apply numerical scores to each parameter, depending if the efficiency of this parameter is high (2), medium (1) or low (0). this qualitative evaluation, based on the discussion of the different elements of the retail mix and the operational challenges, aims to compare the relative efficiency of one parameter in different fulfillment systems. we do not intend to provide an absolute performance test. quality and quantity of information customers expect correct information, especially on pricing and delivery costs of the different channels, but as well on other parameters like product availability, speed of delivery and product characteristics. the retailer's challenge is always to have the right information available on every channel.                                                  4 each of the above identified parameters expressing customer expectations and economic performance of a specific fulfillment system has multiple implications on other parameters. it is to retain that these parameters may be interdependent (e.g. the width of the product offer impacts the product availability, the picking efficiency and the fulfillment infrastructure costs).  rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  17  using a centralized stock provides the highest chance to have the right information available (score: 2), whereas an order preparation from stores induces the problem of obtaining the right information on the store stock level (score: 1). if the order preparation has to be completed on several stock locations (central warehouse and stores), it is very difficult to obtain correct information and the quality of information may be low (score: 0). reliability and respect of commitments customers expect retailers to keep their promises, especially in terms of delivery time and delivery service. central warehouse order preparation should facilitate this, as the quality of information is high and the fulfillment process can be optimized (score: 2). order preparation in the stores suffers from difficulties in keeping a real-time stock level of all the products. therefore, store preparation may guarantee only a medium level of reliability and respect of commitments (score: 1), whereas multi-stock order preparation may only provide a low level (score: 0).  offer customers expect to find the offer they expect on every channel, a large or narrow product range with the appropriate depth of assortment. the retailer has to make sure to be able to offer the products customers expect on every channel. order fulfillment at a central warehouse or from multiple stocks should be capable to provide the entire range of the products (both score: 2), order preparation at the store is limited to the only product assortment in stock at the store (score: 0). product availability the customer expects that the products he intends to buy are available in the channel he desires to use. a central warehouse order preparation may provide only a medium level of product availability (score: 1) compared to the other options, as the availability depends on the stock keeping and forecasting precision of this single warehouse. stores can only guarantee a low level of product availability because of the small number of stock for every referenced product and the continuous buying from customers in the store (score: 0).  multi-stock order preparation may use the stock of different entities (stores and central warehouse) and therefore guarantee a very high level of product availability (score: 2), especially in case of a high number of articles per customer order. rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  18  speed of delivery customers usually expect a rapid delivery of the products they bought and to be informed about the delivery timing. retailers therefore have to implement a fast and reliable delivery process, which may imply an external delivery service provider. a central warehouse usually needs to bridge the distance to the final customer, which may be long and therefore time-consuming. a medium level of speed of delivery may therefore be guaranteed (score: 1). as stores are closer to the final customer, the speed of delivery can be high when orders are prepared in the store (score: 2). orders prepared from multiple stock locations need a long time to be consolidated and can therefore only provide a low relative delivery speed (score: 0). ease of access and return of products customers expect easy access to the retailer to either pick up the products ordered or to return or exchange a product in case of dissatisfaction. home delivery from a central warehouse may make returns and exchange difficult for customers (score: 0), who have to use a postal service for returning the products (except in the case the retailer owns a quite dense network of stores and the store channel is fully integrated to handle returns and exchange from the online channel). order preparation in the store is usually done in the store closest to the customer. this store is therefore easy to access for the customer (score: 2). multi-stock preparation can only provide a medium level of ease of access and return (score: 1). although the customer can return a product to the closest store, exchange can be impossible if the products to be exchanged are only available at another stock location. assurance the customers expect competent and friendly personnel in the store for buying, picking up their orders, return or exchange. the same expectation may apply for the personnel on telephone customer hotlines or the delivery personnel. these functions being very often outsourced (especially the latter), retailers have to focus on their own sales personnel and make sure they provide the level of assurance the customer is expecting by providing the same information to all channels. the assurance of the personnel can only be provided in the case of order pick-up of the customer in the stores (score: 2; other option scores: 0). rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  19  stock efficiency for the retailer, the efficiency of stock management is crucial for numerous reasons. stock keeping and monitoring of stock levels, balancing between different stock locations and the forecasting of sales and product reorders influence the availability of the products and therefore the sales. efficient stock handling is as well an important cost element. central stock management can provide a high level of efficiency (score: 2), whereas a store can only provide a medium efficiency (score: 1) because of the low number of products per article and the continuous stock movement due to customers purchases out of the shelves. the handling of multiple stocks in the fulfillment process is the least efficient (score: 0). picking efficiency the picking of products out of stock to prepare the customer's order is the key process of the overall fulfillment process, representing a very important part of the warehouse operating costs. this process is nevertheless transparent to the customer. a central warehouse can be organized in a way to optimize the picking process by planning and reducing the way picking operators have to go during the process (score: 2). depending on the volumes and the type of articles, it is possible to split the stock for whole cartons or open cartons picking or separate zones for stocking and picking. this optimization cannot be provided in a store or in multiple stock sites (scores: 0). stores' layouts and product locations are planned to make the customer spend the maximum time in the store and not to optimize the picking (de koster, 2002). delivery cost efficiency customers expect to pay the lowest extra cost possible for the delivery of their online orders and the retailer has to reduce the overall cost of the delivery. delivery of orders prepared in a central warehouse has always to include the transport to the customer's home and therefore only achieve a medium efficiency (score: 1) compared to the delivery from a store (score: 2), where the distance to the final customer is short. pick-up by the customer from the store where the order was prepared is the less costly way of delivery for the retailer. any delivery from an order prepared in multiple stock locations (for home delivery or to a store for pick-up) is least efficient (score: 0), as the consolidation process of the order implies multiple costs of handling and transportation. rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  20  channel organization efficiency as stated above, customers want to be able to use different channels simultaneously. a retailer has therefore to manage all the channels in an integrated manner.  preparing orders for home delivery from a central warehouse is the simplest and most efficient organization (score: 2). order preparation in the store involves the online and the store channel in the fulfillment process, therefore adding a level of complexity (score: 1). multi-stock preparation adds further complexity, being therefore the most difficult solution to achieve an efficient channel organization (score: 0). fulfillment infrastructure costs the fulfillment process may generate important investment costs, when a specific site is built as the stock and the distribution center, or if the design and the organization of an existing facility have to be modified. renting or outsourcing this infrastructure generates additional costs as well. a central warehouse order preparation generates a high infrastructure cost (score: 0), whereas the store preparation generates the lowest additional infrastructure costs (score: 2). order preparation from multiple stocks may generate medium additional infrastructure costs (score: 1) to organize the consolidation of the orders. return handling efficiency customers expect their returns to be processed quickly, to receive an exchange product or to get reimbursed the purchasing price. the retailer must therefore provide a quick and efficient return handling process. a central warehouse enables creation of optimized return processing (score: 2) to check the returns, repack and restock them and send the exchange items to the customers. multi-stock fulfillment can only provide a lower rate of return efficiency (score: 1), as the returned items arrive in different locations and the exchange items may only be available on different stock locations. for a store it is very difficult to offer an optimized return process (score: 0), especially when returned products are not part of the store's product offer.  we can therefore summarize the impacts of the different fulfillment systems on the different parameters as follows (figure 3):  rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  21  figure 3: the analysis framework  home delivery customer store pick-up fulfillment system 1.1 1.2 1.3 2.1 2.2  prepared in central warehouse prepared in store prepared in multiple stocks prepared in store prepared in multiple stocks customer expectations      quality and quantity of information high (2) medium (1) low (0) medium (1) low (0) reliability and respect of commitments high (2) medium (1) low (0) medium (1) low (0) offer medium (1) low (0) high (2) low (0) high (2) product availability medium (1) low (0) high (2) low (0) high (2) speed of delivery medium (1) high (2) low (0) high (2) low (0) ease of access and return of products low (0) high (2) medium (1) high (2) medium (1) assurance low (0) low (0) low (0) high (2) high (2)       economic performance      stock efficiency high (2) medium (1) low (0) medium (1) low (0) picking efficiency  high (2) low (0) low (0) low (0) low (0) delivery cost efficiency medium (1) high (2) low (0) high (2) low (0) channel organization efficiency high (2) medium (1) low (0) medium (1) low (0) fulfillment infrastructure costs efficiency low (0) high (2) medium (1) high (2) medium (1) return handling efficiency high (2) low (0) medium (1) low (0) medium (1)       total score customer expectations 7 6 5 8 7 total score economic performance 9 6 2 6 2 total 16 12 7 14 9   this indicates several results: - home delivery from a central warehouse (system 1.1) is the fulfillment system best meeting the combination of the two dimensions customer expectations and economic performance, providing a total score of 16. this system provides the highest score in economic performance (9) and the second highest score in customer expectations (7). - customer pick-up after preparation in the store (system 2.1) provides the highest score in customer expectation (8) and a medium score in economic performance (6). the overall performance of this system is second best (total score of 14). - home delivery after store preparation (system 1.2) provides medium scores in customer expectations (6) and economic performance (6), ranking third best in the overall score (12).  - any fulfillment system implying the order preparation out of multiple stocks appears to be less efficient: if the order is picked up by the customer (system 2.2), the total score is 9, if the rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  22  order is delivered at home (system 1.3), the total score is only 7. in terms of economic performance, these two systems provide the lowest score (2). - economic performances of order preparation in the store or from multiple stocks are identical for both home delivery or in-store pick up by the customer. the difference in customer expectations (difference of 2) results from the possibility to have a personal contact with the customer, therefore responding to the customer expectation of 'assurance', which can only be provided in a store. discussion, managerial implications and research avenues  the qualitative analysis of the different fulfillment systems and their impact on customer expectations and economic performance reveals that different fulfillment systems can provide high overall performance levels in terms of customer expectations and economic performance. the framework shows that orders for home delivery prepared in a central warehouse present only a slightly higher overall performance than an order prepared in a store for customer store-pick-up. a retailer has to assess the importance of each of the analyzed parameters for his specific retail mix and to optimize the trade-offs between channel fulfillment synergies and specific needs on different channels. depending on the product mix between food and non-food products, the width of product assortment and the characteristics of the existing store network, specific solutions may be more appropriate than others to fit with a specific business model. whereas proximity to customers is best achieved through a store network, stores add complexity on different levels in the fulfillment process which affect timing, costs and reliability. multi-stock consolidation seems to be always by far the less efficient model, regarding the customer expectations and the economic performance. this corresponds to the three initially mentioned multi-channel retailers: fnac abandoned the multi-stock preparation and completely integrated their fulfillment for the different channels, and neither tesco nor monoprix apply a multi-stock solution, whilst optimizing the in-store order preparation. rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  23  our proposed framework could prove useful for multi-channel retailers in various ways: it provides a tool to evaluate the chosen fulfillment system and therefore identifying improvement potentials on specific parameters. it could also provide helpful to measure customer satisfaction. moreover, it should clearly be useful in anticipating the needs for fulfillment systems when planning to implement a multi-channel strategy. the proposed qualitative framework should be further validated by conducting supplementary empirical analysis, although it may be difficult to compare economic performances and customer expectations of different fulfillment systems in a same company. another difficulty may be to isolate the impacts of the supply chain from other impacts (marketing, pricing, product policy etc.). a limitation of our framework is the fact that it does not assess the interdependencies between the different dependent parameters, but only focuses on one major impact at a time. a first step to further back this framework could be to conduct a dynamic analysis through a simulation, testing values for the different parameters of the analysis framework. research could aim to find evidence if there is an 'optimum' fulfillment system for every multi-channel retailer. such an optimal model could be defined depending on different independent variables like product assortment, average number of items per shopping basket, value of products, product characteristics, degree of channel integration etc. this would also include an analysis of the trade-off between cost- and customer service level optimization. such a research could as well reveal that there is no optimum model, but just a set of independent and non stabilized models evolving quickly as the retailers' strategy mix evolves.   acknowledgement  the work on this paper was partially supported by the innovation and regulation chair of orange, ecole polytechnique, telecom paris. rirl 2010 -

solutionsaimed at supporting supply chain management by leveraging real-time availability ofsupply chain data, and algorithms capable to recognize, notify, and sometimes manageexceptions.event management software's primary functions includeo measurement,o monitoring,o proactive notification,o decisions support ando control of supply chain by events.several hundred suppliers have already developed and launched in the marketsoftware applications that cover a number of supply chain activities. mrp, drp, andforecasting tools support supply chain and logistics planning activities, while erp,warehouse management, inventory track and trace systems support management of mostof the execution and operational activities. an entire software category, crm, handlesthe relationship with the customers in many of its aspects.ideally, event management software application should be able to link the entiresupply chain, monitoring the flow of goods and information, and alerting any time that apotentially disruptive event or chain of events arises.1.1 the evolution of supply chain event management applicationsfirst generation event management applicationsfirst-generation event management systems are based on inventory management andshipments track and trace capabilities. these systems are able to capture single events -events are typically defined as gaps between a set and a measured level in predefined67parameters, for example low safety stock, or late delivery. the criticality of the event isdirectly proportional to how wide the gap is (for example how depleted is the safetystock, or how many hours/days/weeks late is a shipment). usually the number ofparameters that can be measured and therefore used for management by event is limitedto a set decided by the user and set up by the software provider or system integrator.second generation event management applicationssecond-generation event management systems add to the first-generation capabilities:they not only generate alerts for events, but they also suggest a number of actions aimedat addressing the problem and preventing disruptions, the most advanced are also capableto prioritize this list of possible actions. for example, in the case of a late inboundshipment of raw material, the system is able to offer several options of actions, such asrequesting a shipment from a different supplier, or set up an expedite shipment.third generation event management applicationsthird-generation event management software goes one step forward and offersautomated functionalities as reaction to the event. for example, the system automaticallysends an inventory replenishment order whenever the inventory falls below a set level.additionally, the most sophisticated software solutions are able to link togetherdifferent software systems already in place in the supply chain, like inventory planning,shipment track and trace, and customer relationship management. in this case, if an eventalert regarding a late shipment is generated, the system may be able to cancel the lateorder, automatically switch to a new supplier, set up the shipment with a preferredcarrier, and alert key customers.1.2 future generations of event management applicationseven state-of-the-art event management software, however, typically has aconceptually limited and shortsighted definition of what an \\\"event\\\" is. such systems78tends to lack structure and a truly supply chain oriented framework for providing anadequate definition of what an event is and a meaningful way to measure its criticality.the purpose of this thesis project is to explore the feasibility of a next generation ofevent management software, base on a network analysis systems for inventory/orders,and encompassing the entire flow of inventory, information, and interactions betweenspartners and participants, throughout the entire supply chain.1.3 shortcomings of present event management applicationsin order for event management software to effectively support the supply chain, andbe able to manage by event in a meaningful manner, there are several key factors thatneed to be included in the formulation of the next generation of event managementapplications:1. simply integrating different enterprise software solutions within a single companyor division is often already an overwhelming task. however, building a systemthat can support the entire supply chain activities by event management requiresmuch more than that. in order to enable event management capabilitiesthroughout the entire supply chain, integration is required not only within the wallof the single corporation, but also in the \\\"gray\\\" areas between corporations, in theweakest links, which often are the source of the majority of problems. inter-company ties require visibility to expand to and light the entire supply chain.visibility alone, however, is by no means sufficient to manage a supply chain.visibility is just the first and basic instrument for extracting information from thesupply chain. the information, then, needs to be analyzed, put in perspective,referenced and compared and, finally, transformed into meaningful actions. thereis need for coordination and the ability to capture and eliminate repetitions,duplications, and inefficiencies. measured against a new paradigm, a \\\"disruptiveevent\\\" will no longer be a mere gap between set and measured levels for few89discrete parameters, but rather be a disruptive trend in inventory strategies, or apatterns of late deliveries with roots in the way the company negotiatestransportation with its preferred carriers. such a supply chain event managementsystem assumes that supply chain's participants have the capability of capturingevents, and generating and transmitting data in real time, in and across the entiresupply chain. this in turn assumes the adoption of communication standardswithin the chain, such as xml (extensible markup language) and edi(electronic data interchange) while in the reality, many participants still rely ontelephone, fax, or word and excel documents exchanged by email.2. current solutions are aimed at addressing local problems, with a very low level ofsupply chain coordination. presently the main purpose of the software is to detect,and quickly address operational and day-to-day disruptions that may arise.current solutions miss a reference structure and cannot fully evaluate the impactthat the problem considered may have at a higher level in the supply chain. whilea delay in a single shipment is disruptive, a trend of repeated smaller delays maybe much more harmful for the supply chain, and impossible to detect with thepresent event management instruments. in the currently available software, thecriticality of an event occurring in specific segment of the supply chain is simplymeasured as a gap against set levels. for example, if safety stock falls below a setlevel, the supply chain event management system will trigger an alert, send it tothe process owner at the appropriate level, or even automatically react with anaction (such a replenishment order) to replenish safety stock. however, thesystem is not capable of measuring the event against a supply chain framework,and there is no instrument to evaluate the criticality of that event over the entiresupply chain flow. without a holistic view of a supply chain, and a backbonestructure that reflects this view, it becomes very difficult to meaningfully applyevent management. and it becomes even more difficult to put event managementinto context as a tool for improving inventory management in a broad sense,linked to product lifecycle management and, at a higher level, to the long-termstrategy of a company. current solutions are not equipped to detect and evaluate910how events propagate in the supply chain, and how they affect the long-termbehaviors and trends in the supply chain. in the absence of a reference system toput events into a wider sc perspective, a variation against a set level willautomatically trigger an alert, even if the event were considered non-critical whenmeasured against a comprehensive supply chain model. there is not yet a networkto measure events against; there is no sense of path. there is no differencebetween today's crisis and long-term disruptions. in the absence of a referenceframe or any other input, all events are equal and live just \\\"today\\\". even in thestate of the art event management solutions, there is not yet the sense of time.thus, every event becomes critical and every event becomes a crisis, which needsto be addressed today, and which has high probability of not leaving a trace ofitself.3. supply chain event management software capabilities are confined within a singleparameter at the time (shipment delay, safety stock level, disruption/delay inproduction), while in reality, the supply chain acts as a living organism, wherepatterns and combinations of events, through coordination, ties, and correlation,cross the boundaries of different sectors and create results that may differ widelyfrom the sum of effects created by the single events. currently used alert systemsgenerate alerts when a single exception occurs. specifically, when a parameterexits an acceptability range set in accordance with the user company's policies.however, what often constitutes a trigger for an alert is not a single event, butrather, the combination of a number of events. the presence of patterns of eventshappening in different segments of the supply chain, simultaneously or incascade, can lead to disruptions that cannot be prevented and avoided bymonitoring single exceptions. let's consider the following examples:a) a slightly late delivery event bypasses a traditional event-management system.accords are taken at the phone between the company's buyer and the supplier'ssale force. however, the parts to be delivered are needed for the production ofgoods for an important client whose demand has suddenly doubled. the result of1011this combination of events has a very high probability of generating a non-perfectorder, while none of the single events has.b) a delivery of raw materials is cancelled, and this event triggers a traditionalexception-alert notice, or, in more advanced systems, even an automaticreplenishment order. however, the materials were to be used for a client whosedemand dropped significantly. not only was the delivery cancellation not causingdisruption, but it was contributing to keeping the inventory level in the correctrange.these simple examples show just a few of the limitations of a traditionalexception-based alerting system. they are not flexible and \\\"smart\\\" enough tocapture possible disruptions/improvements to supply chain processes generated bycombinations of different exceptions. additionally, human intervention - such asdirect settling of a problematic event, on the phone between buyers and suppliers- often cancels any trace of the event itself. in the absence of records, it is almostimpossible to identify the causes of recurring problems and address themappropriately.1112chapter 2 literature reviewa future generation of event management systems for inventory management acrossthe entire supply chain, as the one suggested in chapter one, should be:o built on the firm's industry-specific expertise and own practices' knowledge ofinventory management, and capable to monitor the key inventory metrics;o based on project management principles and on a pert-/cpm-like network forinventory, used as framework for putting events into a context which ismeaningful for supply chain dynamics;o capable of leveraging the technology already developed for event managementsolutions, and available in the software currently offered,2.1 inventory parametersin order to measure and quantify the entity of the events related to inventory,inventory parameters need to be set and included in the framework for an eventmanagement solution. such parameters may include forecast frequency and error (to beunderstood in their behavior over time), planning frequency, communication efficiencybetween different levels of the supply chain, and any other relevant parameters affectinginventory management. though most parameters are common to many productionenvironments, there is not a set recipe, since specific industries, business practices, andproduction processes may require or even dictate some of the parameters.in order to assess and correctly quantify the criticality of events, a number of factorsneed to be taken into consideration while setting the appropriate inventory parameters,such factors can grouped under different families as follows:product factors:including details and features of products, at the product-family or sku level, dependingon the nature of the event management solution; product's life cycle; products' physicaldimensions, weight, and packaging requirements;1213cost factors:including factors related to products' cost, pricing, and profit margins. factors related tocost, price, cost of labor, and margin trends play an important role in monitoring a firm'salignment between competitive strategy and internal practices;production factors:including production volume, product mix, ramp up times, production time, cost, andflexibility in domains of both time and cost.it is important to notice that in the process of building a framework able to supportinventory management by exceptions, and when setting the inventory parameters, a firmshould have a clear definition of its processes and align them with the inventorymanagement strategy. additionally, inventory parameters, and the way these parametersare measured, reflect not only the nature of a firm's business, products, and processes, butalso strategic choices, such as the way the firm wants to compete. low cost, speed-to-market, quality, and flexibility, are all different domains for competition, and each ofthem requires a special treatment of inventory, and a specific event managementframework that establish the most important metrics, and capture relevant events andexceptions.2.2 project management, cpm, and pert networks.project managementproject management is defined as the coordination of groups of activities wherein themanagers plan, organize, staff, direct, and control to achieve goals and objectives withconstraints on time, cost, and performance of the end product'. project managementinvolves coordination, and planning, as well as sequencing and scheduling of theactivities and processes that lead to the achievement of the desired goals.1 joseph j. moder, cecil r. phillips, edward w. davis, (1983), \\\"project management with cpm, pertand precedence diagramming\\\"1314project management applied to the flow of inventory within the supply chain impliesthe capability of understanding where the inventory comes from, what relationship a firmhas upstream in the supply chain with its suppliers of products, sub-assemblies, services,and outsourced manufacturing. it implies also that the firm is able to correctly define thesourcing, manufacturing, and inbound and outbound logistics processes as well as theorder fulfillment process downstream in the supply chain, by understanding customerrequirements, expected service level, by being able to prioritize accounts by strategicimportance and by knowing very well industry and competitive dynamics in its market.network models and critical patha network model constitutes the representation of a project as a sequence of activitieseach requiring a set time. in a network model2 (figure 1) all the activities preceding agiven activity must be completed before the given activity commences. each activitylinks an event to the following one, on a given path. in the sequence of activities, whilesome of them are exactly timed, others have a certain slack orfloat time, which meansthat they can be completed prior to the occurrence time of their succeeding activities.in a supply chain model, for example, it makes a significant difference if the sameevent occurs in a slack path (possibly no delay for the rest of the supply chain) or in anon-slack path (in which case all the activities after that will be impacted).a21 2a1

represents the same project using a different representation called time-scaled network. the dashed lines represent activities that could be completed before theoccurrence time of the following ones (slack paths).in a network model, the critical path is defined as the longest path in the network.depending upon the segment of the network where they occur, events and disruptions inthe network can lead to different outcomes, from no consequences, to major delays andthe definition of a new critical path.3 joseph j. moder, cecil r. phillips, edward w. davis, (1983), \\\"project management with cpm, pertand precedence diagramming\\\"4 joseph j. moder, cecil r. phillips, edward w. davis, (1983), \\\"project management with cpm, pertand precedence diagramming\\\"1516in figure 2, the sequence b 1 -c-d3 represents the critical path for this network, in factnone of the activities on this path has float time.network-based project managementnetwork-based project management enable a systematic approach to projectmanagement and includes a clear sequences of actions aimed at creating a completeproject schedule that takes into account actions, processes, resources, and boundaryconditions. network-based project management methodology includes the followingsteps:1. project planning: defining the activities, and their technological dependence. in asupply chain event management system perspective, this translates into looking atthe entire supply chain, clearly defining the processes, and deciding whichparameters need to be measured.2. time and resource estimation: each activity needs to be based on availablemanpower and equipment. in an event management system context, this impliesassigning time estimates to each segment of the inventory path, from suppliers ortiers of suppliers, to end customer.3. basic scheduling: setting the earliest, latest allowable start and finish times foreach activity, and as a byproducts, they define the critical path within the network,and set the slack or float time associated with non-critical paths. the critical pathin the supply chain is now set, and with it the slack associated to selectedactivities. events are not all equally important. their criticality now is associatedto the activities they affect.4. time-cost trade-offs, evaluation of the resource constraints. in a supply chainenvironment, events are put into context; the choice of possible action involves1617trade offs that have deep roots in the strategy of the firm for inventory, pricingand competition.5. resource allocation: manpower and equipment constraints6. project control (time and cost): the schedule is used to measure the actual project.whenever major changes are required in the schedule, the network is revisedaccordingly and a new schedule is computed (see time control in chp 4, biblio 3).this will be a core part of future event management solutions.pertthe project evaluation and review technique (pert) statistical approach tonetwork modeling introduces probability theory in the management decision-makingprocess. pert and critical path method (cpm) are based on the same network setup, thepert system, however, uses a probabilistic approach to the time estimate for theactivities.given the mean as measure of central tendency of n measurements of the timeduration of an activity:(2.1) - = (t + 2 +.nand the standard deviation as measure of variability:(2.2) s = -(tf ) 2 +( 2 - f)2 +.+ (t _- )2nt approaches te , the expected time of completion of a given activity, for a sample ofmeasures that approaches infinity, and similarly, st approaches the square root of thevariance vt1 12the pert methodology then leverages the central limit theorem:given m independent tasks to be performed in sequence; t,, the actual time required tocomplete each task; vt. the actual variance associated with each tm (vtr and tm areunknown until the ask is performed), and t defined as follows:1718(2.3) t =t+t 2 +...+tm(t is also a random variable), then for m large enough, the distribution of t isapproximately normal with mean e and variance vt given by:(2.4) e =te +te2 +.+.tem(2.5) vt =vtl+vt2 +.+vtmthe mean of the sums is the sum of the means, the variance of the sum is the sum of thevariances, and the distribution of the sum of activity times will be normal regardless ofthe shape of the distribution of actual activity performance times.pert uses three time estimates for each activity, an optimistic, a likely and apessimistic estimate. this range of estimates provides a measure of the uncertaintyassociated with the actual time required to perform the given activity. the estimated timefor a given activity, in pert is counted as a weighted average of the quantities:to= the most optimistic estimate (5% percentile)tm= the most likely estimate (modal estimate)tp= the most pessimistic estimate (95% percentile)as follows:te = estimated time for the activity(t0 +4tm,tp)(2.6) te 66(2.7) vt = 3 2the variance vt is computed with the following rules:o vt for the initial event is set to 0o vt for a generic, non-merge event in the network is calculated as the sum of theactivity variance vt and the precedent event variance.o vt for a merge event is calculated as the sum of the activity variance vt on thelongest path, in the case of ties, we use the path with the larger variance.1819the central limit theorem allows the assumption that the shape of the distribution of tis approximately normal, therefore probabilities can attached to each possible outcomesfor the project completion.2.3 existing event management softwareseveral firms have addressed the need for event management software. the followinglist includes some well-known names in the enterprise software industry:categoric softwarethe company's product, xalerts, enable monitoring, notification, detection, andresponse to business critical events in real time. criticality, however, seems to bemeasured again against fixed levels rather than put into a holistic supply chain context.eventraeventra software's event management strength lies in supply chain visibility and dataavailability, especially related to the enterprise inbound flow.j.d. edwardsaccording to andy carlson, j.d. edwards' direct of supply chain product marketing\\\"inventory arrives. it's damaged in shipment. the receiving dock barcodes it and

focused on inventory visibility, with track and trace functionality,and a strong operational flavor. however, there is no mention of complex eventmanagement and of a structure able to support more

to view the mostup-to-date information about the state of their supply chain, to collaborate with otherusers about exceptions and issues, to rapidly respond to exceptions ... \\\". still there is nomention of a more complex event management structure able to self-assess eventcriticality as measured against a more complex supply chain model.2021vizional (saltare)vizional's software focuses on execution, track and trace capabilities, inventoryvisibility, and traditional event management functionality.2122chapter 3 development of the conceptin order to understand how to implement project management and pert techniquesin a supply chain event management context, we have approached the problem from twodifferent point of view:o analysis of a single order fulfillment process: the order comes into the firm andtriggers a sequence of inter-related activities that ends with the customer receivinga shipment. this approach explores some of the supply chain dynamics throughthe lens of the single order, which replicates, in miniature, how the inventorymoves in the out-bound chain. we have labeled it \\\"micro-dynamic\\\" approach.o a second approach, labeled as \\\"macro-dynamic\\\" approach, includes a pertmodel of the inventory itself, modeling the flow of goods and information in thesupply chain.it's important to notice that the purpose of these two approaches is not to providedetailed pert networks of the order fulfillment process and supply chain inventorymanagement, but rather to show the potential advantages of a supply chain eventmanagement framework that exploits the strength of such project management tools.an additional section is dedicated to how it is possible to leverage data collectedthrough event management activities to support and improve the pert network itself -by gathering reliable inputs for the time estimates - and provide a solid repository forbuilding a firm's in-depth knowledge of supply chain trends and dynamics, through theanalysis of meaningful data.3.1 micro-dynamics approach: a network path for the order fulfillment processthe order fulfillment process has been selected for a first approach to the use of apert methodology in an event management context. the idea is to build a network thatidentifies a critical path and see how to measure events against the network scheme.2223figure 3 shows a simplified project network model of a single order fulfillment. ninemain nodes have been specified, numbered from zero to eight, and each node isconnected to the following one(s) by activities.nodes0 order

characterized as the longest path in the system: the path is given bythe sequence of nodes: 0-1-3-6-7-8 (table 2).by applying a \\\"micro-dynamics\\\" pert technique we can associate to every order itsown specific network path, were the determination of the duration times to, tm, and tpdepends on values known from past orders, as well as on the nature of the specific order,2425importance of the account, and present business conditions. a problem is critical if itimplies a delay for the customer. for one order the documentation can be on the criticalpath, while for another it can be transportation, or warehouse constraints, or outsourcedproduction. an event is not critical if there is slack that allows for delays in the processwith no delay for the final customer. events can be then sorted based on the path werethey occur, that path's criticality, and the consequences that events bring to the overallsystem critical path.given the normal distribution of the project completion time, under the pertassumptions, it is also possible to calculate the probability to complete the project -fulfillment process in the case of the example - on time, or on a given day before orafter the expected completion time, assuming that there are no changes in the criticalpath. for the fulfillment process example, the expected completion time is 19 days, andfigure 6 shows the probability of completing the process in different completion times,from 15 to 25 days.figure 7. probability associated with the completion time estimate25cumulative probability of completion ofthe project1.0-...

time estimatethe determination of he critical path allows us to divide supply chain events (both inthe micro- and macro-system examples) in three main categories:1. events that do not introduce delays in the overall project. such events will occurin paths with slack, and the delay that they bring is smaller than the slack time,therefore these events neither delay the overall process, nor define a new criticalpath;2. events that fall on the critical paths, and therefore introduce delays in the overallproject, but without changing the critical path. the delays introduced from suchevents will always propagate in the supply chain and lead to an overall process28cumulative probability of completionof the project1.0-0..80.0.17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 3329delay, but the sequence of activities that determines the critical path does notchange; and3. events that fall into slack paths and introduce delays larger than the allowed slack,therefore generating new critical paths. such events change the sequence ofactivities that lie on the critical path and design a new critical path.3.3 memory of past events: turning event management into a tool for monitoringmid-and long-time strategic goals.a very important part of a pert framework in a supply chain event managementcontext is a repository storing information about past events. such a resource, which hasthe function of \\\"memory\\\" for the event management system, will be used for assessingthe probability of delays based on past events. the information about past events,generated by the system, and stored in the repository, can provide data for setting theparameters to, tm, and tp for each path in the network.additionally, the information, and the behavior of the changes of critical paths can beused to categorize and understand mid- and long-term patterns and trends, versus short-term fixes, and understand the roots of the problems.for example, from a high frequency of events in an inbound transportation path,rather than simply extracting the frequency of late shipments, which does not necessarilyhave an operational relevance, we can extract the following information:o what percentage of late shipments is disruptive, and generates an overall delay tothe supply chain (because they either fall on a critical path, or on a path with slackand the delay exceeds the slack);o what percentage of these disruptive delays can be associated with specific causes,such as the choice of carrier, or supplier;2930o how the expected time of completion in a path evolves in time, and howperformance of suppliers of parts and services can affect the probability ofperformance in specific paths, especially in critical ones.3031chapter 4 conclusions and findings4.1 key findingsthese are some of the key findings that emerge from the analysis of the adoption of apert-based network for inventory to be used in supply chain event management:1. a definition of \\\"criticality\\\" is key to have effective supply chain management byevents. project-management based frameworks, like the one developed in thisproject thesis, should be used as a base for building an event management systemwith a clear and well-defined concept of criticality embedded in it;2. not all events are equal. there are multiple dimensions to define the relevanceand criticality of an event. presently available solutions are able to exploit onesingle dimension: the gap between a planned level and an actual one. however, auseful and operationally sound definition of criticality should also include theeffects and repercussions of that delay into the supply chain, and link the event tothe changes that may be created in the critical path;3. such networks do not simply compare set levels of certain parameters, but rather\\\"learn\\\" from the past. past events contribute to the computation of pathcompletion estimates and associated probability, thus they are instrumental indefining the probability of future events and determining the critical path (whichdepends on longest paths in first place and on largest variances as second elementfor choices);4. when an event changes the critical path, by affecting an activity with slack timeand exceeding the available slack, then a new critical path will be determined inthe network. in this case, \\\"criticality\\\" can shift to new areas of the supply chain,with consequences that can be located very far from the path where the event3132happens. a project management definition of criticality and a holistic view of thesupply chain can help put events into a context and monitor the \\\"critical\\\" part andpaths in the supply chain.5. when the attention shifts from looking at gaps between expected and measuredparameters, to considering the consequences of an event throughout the entiresupply chain network, then event management becomes a way to gain insight intosupply chain dynamics and a tool to understand and strategically manage thesupply chain, rather than \\\"fix\\\" problems locally;all these elements lead to a division of events in four major families:o events that do not bear supply chain-wide consequences: these are eventsthat happen in activities with slack times, and introduce perturbation witha duration shorter than the available slack.o events that introduce time delays in the supply chain: these are events thatfalls on the critical path (which is the longest path in the network),therefore, whatever delay they introduce, will propagate throughout theentire network;o events that define new critical paths: these events not only introduce delayin the network, but also re-define the concatenation of paths that form thecritical one. such events introduce substantial changes in the network adshift criticality to new activities that can suddenly assume a differentmeaning for the overall supply-chain.o \\\"new\\\" events: the definition of what a \\\"critical event\\\" is can be expandedbeyond a single occurrence of a gap between a set and a measured level(in inventory, safety stock, transit time). the new definition includespatterns in demand and supply, changes in probabilities, opportunities ofbundling, and a number of other elements that can influence a pathcriticality32334.2 what is needed to get thereis it possible to implement such a system? in most cases the answer is: not yet. or atleast, not at a supply-chain wide level. yet, even partial implementations of systemsdriven by such project-management network models represent a significant improvementover presently available supply chain management systems. what then is needed and maynot yet be there?1. a central repository for supply chain information. as said, not all events are equaland they can impact the supply chain in very different way, especially patternedand repeated events. dramatic changes in critical path can suggest the need forchanges in a firm's strategic approach to certain areas of the supply chain.analysis and understanding of such changes can guide high-level decisions, suchas outsource vs. manufacture, internal fleet vs. external carrier among others. thefirst step, however, is to be able to capture such event-related information andtrends, in a central repository that can function as a \\\"memory\\\" for the entiresystem.2. more informatization in the supply chain. if activities included in the critical pathinvolve parties (such as suppliers, transportation provider, contract manufacturers,customers, among others) that are not able to link their it system to the eventmanagement system, there may be severe limitation to the purpose and scope ofan event management system.3. access to past event-related information. the central repository has the multiplefunctions of central unit for the coordination of supply chain event managementtrigger system, of source for the pert network path completion time estimates,and of storage point for event logs, which can then be retrieved and used foranalytics and data mining activity.33344. internal company barriers can put limitations to what can be done with an eventmanagement system. the layout of a frame system for supply chain eventmanagement requires coordination and inclusion of strategic, tactical, and day-to-day activities, keeping into account the entire supply chain and the firm's overallstrategy. it is important that all the parties involved make their contribution,because that will determine the definition of critical paths.3435bibliography1) david i. cleland, william r.

(1995), inventory is maintained to cater for customers' orders and competition and also to mitigate the effect of production and delivery lead-time. this leads to the concept of 'make to stock' instead of 'make to order' in anticipation of orders. the concept 'make to stock' requires an effective forecasting process, particularly the accuracy between the forecast and actual orders. moreover, the consumers' knowledge and choices have changed over the years and the current emphasis is more than 'fulfilling the needs' but rather 'satisfying their needs'. thus, for many manufacturers, having the product range with high consumer demand are preferable with a wider range of options. they become more competitive, particularly for technology related products.     inventory is part of the assets of an organization and therefore, it is part of working capital. for some industries, for example, the high technology industry, the working capital required to finance operations is high. mistakes have serious consequences. many have difficulties coping with the continuous investment required to stay in business. in the aerospace industry, delays from the suppliers can result in the companies compensating customers for late delivery of the airplane. the amount involved in paying the penalty due to late delivery can easily wipe out profit for the year and will definitely affect the company working capital in the near future. thus, it is not surprising that most large organizations recognize the importance of supply chain management and include it as a key activity to improve the organization performance. traditionally, organizational performance is linked to profitability. this can be achieved through order fulfillment. such measurement is still very much valid, for instance, the return to shareholder fund is an important measurement to convince the shareholder for future re-investment, for additional capacity or new equipment or technologies as the industry dictate from time to time. apart from profitability, another important measurement is the volume of sales either by pieces sold or the amount invoiced. purchases in bulk or higher quantity reduces the fixed cost and to some degree, it is able to share out the variable cost. the greater the volume of purchases, the more likelihood that per item price will be reduced, either through effective negotiation or bulk purchase discount offered by the suppliers. moreover, with the intense global competition, many companies have started working closely with their suppliers to improve their product quality, and at the same time, reduce the cost of the products. this can be observed in the electronics sector where the big players are pushing the inventory management responsibility to their

this is where information sharing is viewed as very important and crucial. the suppliers are made aware of any stock movements. the information is in real time thus ensuring accuracy in decision making.  it is often argued that organizations with weak inventory management are not competitive and may fail to survive. according to lewis (2003), continuous down time in the manufacturing can lead to higher cost of operation. in the absence of inventory management, order fulfillment is affected. thus, the success or failure of the business totally depends on the inventory management as high order fulfillment generates better customer service level and higher profitability. moreover, many items today have a shelf life and strict requirements to ensure the product functions optimally during usage and throughout the total product life cycle. in the aerospace industry, the firms impose shelf life for most of the items used, especially for items termed 'flyaway' products, where records must show that these items are still valid and as described in the requirements. apart from the shelf life, keeping the items in the recommended storage condition is equally important where the composite materials are required to be stored for instance,in an environment below 20oc. otherwise their properties need to be retested before further product applications. this reveals the importance of inventory management in the airline industry.inventory and supply chain management in the aerospace industry 2.0 this paper examines the relationship between inventory management and order fulfillment performance. it reviews the literature examining the supply chain management and its effect on company profitability in the aerospace (high technology) industry. with the rapid rate of globalization and intense competition in the business arena, major changes are expected in inventory management and the entire supply chain management dealing with the planning and control of total material flow from end to end, that is from suppliers to end users. one of the very important parts of the supply chain is to determine the location of inventory and at what level to efficiently provide efficient service to customers at the most competitive cost. effective inventory management will result in the right level of customer service. the right service level ensures that customers are satisfied and having the right policies in the inventory management is part of the total supply chain management concept. inventory optimization can reduce the working capital or capital outlay, but the level required to balance with the level of customer service required is of utmost concern as many suggest that this could be different between firms in different industries the necessary inventory level to be maintained to ensure that manufacturing processes are not affected is the primary goal for most manufacturers and the losses incurred for down time are always too expensive. moreover, there is possibility that the manufacturer's capacity loss due to delays cannot be recovered. this damages the  firm's reputation and 46

the aerospace industry, any delays including non-performance in delivery result in heavy penalty imposed by the industry players.  therefore the relationship between inventory and order fulfillment in the context of supply chain management is important and expected to apply more stringently in the aerospace industry. inventory management does not receive much attention from the top and senior management unless there are issues of production stoppage or customer's claim due to delivery delays. in most cases, top management only gets involved when the situation is really bad and some use the fire-fighting strategy to combat the problems. during such correction time, apportioning blame and finger pointing is usual in organizations. however, the root cause of the problem is never resolved, neither are plans made for improvements nor corrections carried out. based on findings from previous studies, the inventory management issue must be given serious attention by all, industry pratictioner and the academics. inventory management must be included in the core subject due to its importance in meeting the customer's requirements and a primary factor in determining service level. the industry must have individuals who are well versed in inventory management in order to minimize the problems arising from the supply chain process and activities. figure 1 indicates the supply chain process in the aerospace industry and it can be observed that it is not much different from the supply chain process for most manufacturers as given by most textbooks. figure 1. the supply chain processin supply chain management, information sharing is an important element (paulraj, 2004; devaraj, krajewski & wei 2007). information on lead-time and quantity are important for the success of the supply chain management. according to zhang et al. (2002) and chopra (2001), it also ensures improvement in the supply chain cycle. lee !\\\"!!  order fulfillment in supply chain management: does the dimension of inventory management matter in the aerospace                  47industry in malaysia: 43-52                                                                                                                                                      et al. (1997) suggests that the supplier's demand difference is drastically reduced due to the sharing of information among them. the fact that supplier management has become an important part of supply chain management is evident in our study. however, there are studies that stated otherwise. for example, the study by cachon and fisher (2000) found the insignificant benefits of information sharing. their finding is not unexpected, as the possible reasons could be the limited data size.    with regard to the number of sources in supplying products and materials to the manufacturers, the source of inventory from one source and two sources makes a substantial difference when there is an imbalance in demand and supply (tang, 2006). when there is an alternative, it means there is no restriction (gavirneni et al. 1999) and the information becomes valuable when it is flexible in responding to the system. in our study, the leading edge organizations are moving their quality focus from inspection to designing quality into products coupled with process control and process improvement efforts. they have appointed suppliers and the number is very small, only one or two suppliers for most materials. thus, the service level is expected to be efficient as it affects the success in managing the supply chain and the organization performance.due to the high carrying cost in the aerospace industry, the amount of inventory is kept at a minimum level most of the time. to minimize the inventory, the aerospace organizations work with the suppliers and the small number of suppliers allows for better relationship with them. in theory, assuming the volume remains constant, a decrease in supplier base means an increase in volume to the strategic suppliers and possible reduction in price due to increase in quantity. this is something that is disputable in our study. the research framework for our study is provided as in depicted in figure 2.figure 2. research frameworkresearch methodology3.0 the methodology adopted in our research is the quantitative approach. the data collection was done using questionnaires distributed to identified suppliers to the iv

understanding of the type, collection and analysis of evidence within a well-defined theoretical framework, the research methodology section here covers the mentioned aspects.  the target population is the companies that have business deals with the two main aerospace companies in malaysia. a total of 20 companies were identified from the list provided by both boeing and airbus companies. for each company, 5 sets of questionnaires were distributed to the managers. in total, 85 sets of questionnaires were returned. the main reason the total population is low is that the aerospace industry is relatively new in malaysia. with the required technology and considerable huge investment, not many are able to become suppliers. the study thus becomes like a census. however, they were not compelled to respond to the questionnaire and only those who were willing to participate were counted as the sample. the data collection process was difficult as most of the respondents practice very strict rules on matters pertaining to sharing information with outsiders.  the dependent variables are on-time-delivery and inventory turns, which represent order fulfillment. the independent variables as provided in figure 2 are the (i) safety stock, (ii) storage practice, (iii) inventory risk and (iv) stock holding. each is examined separately, thus, eight hypotheses were tested. validity and reliability tests were performed prior to the regression analysis.  4.0 findingsthe data collected for this study was analyzed using the statistical package for social sciences (spss) software. missing data and outliers were removed during the analysis. reliability tests, using cronbach's alpha, were performed on the measures of \\\"inventory management\\\" and \\\"order fulfillment\\\". for the measure of \\\"inventory management\\\" which has four dimensions: stock holding, inventory risk, safety stock, and storage practice, the reliability scores range from 0.610 (safety stock) to 0.859 (stock holding). the scores indicate that the measure of \\\"inventory management\\\" has acceptable reliability levels for its dimensions. reliability scores for the \\\"order fulfillment\\\", which has two dimensions: on-time delivery and inventory turns, are 0.763 and 0.765 respectively. the scores indicate that both dimensions of \\\"order fulfillment\\\" possess acceptable levels of reliability. the results of the reliability tests are shown in the following table, table 1.regression analyses were conducted to examine the effects of the inventory management dimensions on order fulfillment. the first analysis was to examine the effects of those dimensions on the first dimension of order fulfillment, i.e. on-time delivery. the second analysis was to examine the effects of the inventory management dimensions on the second dimension of order fulfillment, i.e. inventory turns. order fulfillment in supply chain management: does the dimension of

table 2, it can be seen that the inventory management dimensions account for about 11.3% of the variance in on-time delivery (r2 = 0.113, f= 1.573, p < 0.167). only one out of four dimensions is significantly related with on-time delivery: safety stock (\\u03b2 = 0.276, p \\u2264 0.05). for inventory turns, two of the inventory management dimensions are significantly related to it: safety stock (\\u03b2 = 0.209, p \\u2264 0.10) and storage practices (\\u03b2 = 0.296, p \\u2264 0.01). these two dimensions of inventory management account for about 29.6% of variance in inventory turns (r2

holding on the supply chain management shows that it is not in line with previous studies such as sheffi (2002) and wanke (2011). this opposite finding could be explained by the fact that this study was conducted in a high technology industry where the cost of stock holding is very expensive. moreover, the items are specialized and relatively in fewer in number. its supply is regulated by the manufacturers of the raw material and it is more toward a 'just-in-time' practices. similarly, the results for inventory risk also show different findings from the previous literature, for example by harland et al. (2003) and kleindorfer and saad (2005). similar arguments can be used to justify the insignificant effect of inventory risk on order fulfillment, further justification could be that the high technology players are cash rich which represents a relatively low percentage of the total working capital.results for the test on safety stock indicate a significant effect on both dimensions of order fulfillment. this is in line with many findings of previous studies such as (hult et al., 2004), wanke (2011) and sheffi and rice (2005). in the aerospace industry, the importance of safety stock can not be denied. if the components are not available just-in-time, ultimately the cost of processing will increase drastically due to the expensive nature of operations. the results of the tests on storage practices show a significant relationship only with inventory turn. this is explained by the fact that inventory turns influences the storage practices and policy (levy, 1997), thus having the right storage practices affects the inventory turns, as proven in the finding. moreover, the storage practices appear to be cost significant to both of the dimensions of order fulfillment. thus, it is suggested here that in the aerospace industry, due to the high value of components, more inventory turns are required. this requires better and appropriate storage practices and policies.the findings of this study are actually similar to various research findings such as levy (1997) and pujawan n (2008). this proves the importance of inventory management in order fulfillment for all industries inclusive of the high technology aerospace industry. although only two dimensions of inventory management: safety stock and storage practices, were found to be significant, it is justified by the nature and the environment of the industry. this paper provides a fresh perspective on inventory management affecting the order fulfillment. it shows that it is important to take the necessary steps to support the order fulfillment in a supply chain environment. within the context of high technology firms, particularly the aerospace industry, safety stock and storage practices are the two important factors in inventory management to improve order fulfillment. many organizations have been paying the penalty for non-conforming to delivery without realizing the importance of managing their supply chain management. it is suggested that future studies should look into different contexts such as in the solar industry, which also has a high carrying cost and high value of raw materials. it is order fulfillment in supply chain management: does the dimension of inventory management matter in the aerospace                  51industry in malaysia: 43-52                                                                                                                                                      hoped that this research can be of use to the industry in understanding the importance of inventory management in the supply chain perspective. referencescachon, g., & fisher, m.

Eng. in Logistics)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, 2010.Cataloged from PDF version of thesis.Includes bibliographical references (p. 83-84).Perishability presents a challenging problem in inventory management for the fresh produce industry since it can lead to higher inventory costs and lower service levels. If a supply chain has multiple echelons, that further complicates the issue since companies have an added risk of not having the right amount of product at the right location at the right time. We conduct our research on Chiquita's Fresh Express supply chain. We analyze the impact of perishability on total relevant costs. Our research focuses on determining the optimal inventory policy for the system considering inventory holding costs, shrinkage costs, lost sales costs, forecast accuracy and service levels. We test the sensitivity of the system with respect to forecast errors and the transportation lead time. We developed a discrete-event simulation model using Arena software to conduct the research. Our research demonstrates that by lowering the current target on-hand inventory levels at the distribution center and retail stores, inventory holding costs and shrinkage costs are reduced significantly. Under the optimal inventory policy, the system can save 31% in costs, improve the item fill rate at the distribution center, reduce the total shrinkage volume, and maintain high service levels of more than 95% at the retail stores. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the system is very sensitive to the forecast errors. Additionally, we recommend keeping the transportation lead time as low as possible to maximize the products' lifetime at the retail stores. Reducing the forecast errors or the transportation lead time would reduce the total relevant cost of the system while improving the item fill rates across the supply chain.by Yogeshwar D.

freshfood products including bananas, various other fruits, and blends of packaged green salads. thecompany markets its products under the chiquita @ and fresh express @ brands and otherrelated trademarks. the perishable nature of chiquita's products presents a challenge inmanaging the inventory as keeping track of the age of inventory is challenging. the multiplelayers of inventory locations throughout the supply chain further complicate the issue ofinventory management. additionally, the volatile demand of the fresh express line and theinexperienced produce buyers at the retail level make the issue even more challenging.developing better order and inventory policies requires an understanding of the impacts of theproduct's limited lifetime, the interactions of multiple inventory locations, and the trade-offbetween the relevant costs and the customer service levels.the objective of our research is to quantify these impacts and trade-offs to helpchiquita's management to develop a better inventory policy that minimizes the costs and at thesame time achieves the desired customer service levels. the management at chiquita isconsidering changing the existing inventory and order policies in order to minimize out-of-stockand spoilage for its fresh express line of packaged green salads. due to confidentialityconcerns, all the numbers used throughout the thesis are for illustrative purposes only and are notnecessarily indicative of actual performance at chiquita.1.1 problem descriptionwhile most inventory models assume that items can be stored indefinitely to meet futuredemand, in reality not all items have an infinite lifetime. perishable inventory is defined as itemsthat decay in storage; as time elapses, the items gradually become partially or entirely unsuitable10for consumption. typical examples of perishable inventories include fresh produce,photographic films, drugs, and blood. perishability is typically classified into two categories:fixed lifetime and random lifetime. a product with a fixed lifetime has a pre-determinedlifetime, meaning after a specific number of periods, the product becomes unusable and must bediscarded. in reality, many products have random lifetimes because the exact lifetime cannot bepre-determined. for example, a product with a random lifetime could decay exponentially,implying that a fraction of the inventory is lost each period. products could also have a randomlifetime, a variable with a specific probability distribution (nahmias, 82).perishability presents a challenging problem for inventory management. perishabilitycan lead to increases in four costs:\\\" inventory shrinkage costs: costs due to inventory that must be discarded because ofspoilagee shortage costs: lost sales costs due to inventory stock out caused by perishability\\\" ordering costs: higher ordering costs due to more frequent purchases to counter theperishable nature of the products\\\" inventory carrying costs: higher inventory holding costs due to the lack of understandingfor the proper inventory levelin order to effectively manage inventory costs, supply chain managers must keep track of eachage level of the inventories. however, keeping track of the age of each unit at each period maybe difficult and impractical for most companies due to extensive computations that are involved.given this complexity, optimizing the system is incredibly difficult.most supply chain networks have a series of inventory locations; rarely is there only oneinventory location that ships to the final destination. supply chain networks with multiple layersof inventory locations are referred to as multi-echelon supply chains. having inventory inmultiple layers may have benefits, such as shorter lead time for the final destinations, betterservice for the final destinations, and lower transportation cost through shipment consolidation.however, since available inventory is divided and stored at more than one location, a multi-echelon system may have a higher risk of not having the right amount of product at the rightlocation at the right time (taylor, 2004). in order to have an effective inventory policy, one mustdetermine the dependencies between echelons and the proper inventory level required at eachechelon.1.2 the case of chiquita's fresh expresschiquita's fresh express network represents a complex multi-echelon perishable supply chain.the raw materials of fresh express products are harvested from either california or arizona,depending on the season, and then shipped across the united states to chiquita's plants to beprocessed and packaged. the cycle time for raw materials to be turned into packaged salads istypically two or three days. once the salads are packaged, they are usually shipped to chiquita'scustomers' distribution centers (dc) within two days. typically, the products stay in customers'dcs no longer than two days before they are shipped again to the retail locations. the total leadtime is merely four to six days for chiquita to harvest the vegetables from the field, ship thevegetables across the nation to be processed into packaged salads, ship the packaged salads tocustomers' distribution, and deliver them to the retail locations.additionally, the high demand volatility of packaged salads further complicates the issueof managing fresh express inventories. the sales volume of packaged salads is heavilyinfluenced by retail promotions; a high percentage of fresh express' volume is sold underpromotions. the retailers frequently lower the prices for two purposes: to increase sales volumeand store traffic as a part of the marketing efforts, and to clear out aging inventory to minimizethe risk of potential loss of unusable inventories.these three issues (perishability, the multi-echelon system, and the high demandvolatility) combine together make inventory management for fresh express extremely difficult.inventory is often managed based on buyers' experience and intuition, which is by nature subjectto human error. as a result, chiquita and the retailers often carry excessive inventories to try toachieve a high service level. a large percentage of the inventory at the retailers' warehouses andthe retail stores is considered no longer fresh for consumers to purchase and needs to bediscarded. hence, chiquita would like to know whether or not a better multi-echelon inventorymanagement system can be developed for its fresh express products. specifically, chiquita isinterested in answering the following questions:1) what are the parameters for optimal inventory management depending upon forecastaccuracy, inventory carrying cost, product perishability, lost sales and inventory shrinkagecosts?2) what is the trade-off between service level and inventory costs?3) what is the impact of increased forecast accuracy on inventory-related costs?1.3 research motivationthe analysis of multi-echelon perishable systems is not as well developed as that of single-echelon perishable systems. most research for multi-echelon perishable systems has assumedthat the product has a fixed lifetime at each echelon, the system uses a continuous reviewinventory policy (inventory is reviewed continuously, and an order is placed whenever theinventory reaches below a particular level), and the system allows backorders (unfilled orderscan be fulfilled in the future). however, chiquita's fresh express supply chain is a multi-echelon system with products that have random lifetimes. also, the system uses a periodicreview inventory policy (inventory is reviewed periodically, and an order may be placed basedon the inventory level after each review) and unfilled orders are considered lost sales. therefore,the assumptions used in most research are not applicable to chiquita's fresh express supplychain.in this thesis we develop an inventory management system that simulates chiquita's freshexpress supply chain. our research focuses on identifying ways to minimize out-of-stock andinventory shrinkage while maintaining high service levels, which are common goals that mostcompanies share. the objective of this research is to address the three key questions posed in theprevious section by chiquita and provide recommendation on multi-echelon inventory systemsfor fresh produce supply chains.1.4 research scopethis research uses chiquita's fresh express supply chain as a case to develop a betterunderstanding of the challenges that fresh produce companies may face in managing theirinventories. in order to simulate chiquita's supply chain, the research assumes that all productshave random lifetimes that decay according to a shrinkage probability and have maximumlifetimes of 14 periods (days). the system uses a periodic review and all backorders in thesystem are considered lost sales. these assumptions are based on system descriptions providedby chiquita personnel.our analysis focuses on one supply chain of chiquita's fresh express line, which starts atchiquita's plant in georgia. this plant is located across the nation from the sources of rawmaterials. we chose this location because it serves one of chiquita's biggest customers, whichwe refer to as abc, inc. (abc). for the next echelon, we chose abc's dc located in florida,.~ .' . ... . .......because this dc is served by chiquita's georgia plant and has one of the highest sales volumes.figure 1.1 illustrates the physical locations of the sources of raw materials, chiquita's plant ingeorgia, and the customer's dc in florida.legendplant, galeizendraw product transport during summer customer dc, fl- raw product transport during spring and fall- raw product transport during winter retail stores, fl-- lb finished product transportfigure 1.1: chiquita's fresh express supply chainadditionally, we chose two retail stores that have typical characteristics shared by mostretail locations served by the customer's dc. we chose this supply chain because it represents alarge portion of fresh express' volume and possesses common characteristics shared by freshexpress' other supply chains with other customers. the physical structure of this supply chain(one plant, followed by one dc, followed by multiple retailers) is common for chiquita.therefore we expect the results of our research to be applicable to fresh express' other supplychains and to provide insights to other companies that have similar supply chain structures.1.5 thesis structurethe thesis continues as follows. in chapter 2, we provide a review of the relevantliterature and methodology used in other research. in chapter 3, we provide the methodology,various assumptions and the conceptual flow of our research and model. in chapter 4, wedocument the model, the results of each simulation run, and a detailed analysis for each scenarioin the testing plan. finally in chapter 5, we conclude by providing overall observations andimplications of our research, key insights, and recommendations for future research.2 literature reviewin order to determine the best approach for modeling chiquita's supply chain, we surveyed theacademic literature to understand analytical approaches on how to develop an inventory policyfor perishable products in multi-echelon systems. the literature available on inventory systemsfor perishable items varies by a combination of four assumptions or considerations: deterministicor stochastic demand, fixed or random lifetime, single period or multiple period of productlifetime, and single or multiple echelons. in section 2.1, we review the analytical approaches forsingle echelon inventory management, and in section 2.2, we review the analytical approachesfor multi-echelon inventory management systems. although the amount of literature onperishable inventory available is abundant, none of the models have assumptions that match wellwith the reality in chiquita's business model.due to the complexity and limitations involved in implementing an analytical model forchiquita's fresh express supply chain, we also surveyed literature on simulation methodologiesto better understand whether a simulation model would be suitable for the scope of our research.this survey confirmed that simulation is a practical approach to model a complex system, andwe present relevant literature on simulation methodology in section 2.3.2.1 perishable inventory management for single-echelon systemsthe origin of all perishable inventory system analysis can be traced back to the simple newsboymodel, in which the product lifetime is exactly one period and the order quantity decision isindependent in each period. both van zyl (1964) and nahmias and pierskalla (1973) derivedoptimal policies for products with fixed lifetimes of two periods and stochastic demand. van zylderived dynamic programming functional equations that consider ordering costs and shortagecosts. nahmias and pierskalla approach the issue by considering the outdating and shortagescosts. fries (1975) and nahmias (1975) extended the literature to consider products withlifetime beyond two periods with stochastic demand.as nahmias (1982) explains, the main challenge in managing perishable inventory lies intracking inventories of different age-groups at each position in the supply chain. thus, when aproduct lifetime becomes greater than three periods, models become multi-dimensional andcomputationally extensive. because computation of optimal policies for such systems becomesimpractical for everyday business decisions, approximations are potentially good alternativechoices. cohen (1976) developed an optimal critical number policy by using the stationarydistribution of stock levels and then finding the critical number of periods' worth of demand toorder that minimizes the expected cost. however, when the product lifetime is greater than threeperiods, obtaining the stationary distribution of the starting stock becomes very challenging.nahmias (1976) eased the computation by developing a heuristic critical number approximationapproach for products with fixed lifetime and stochastic demand. this approximation model wasproven to result in costs that are generally less than one percent higher than the global optimalcost. nahmias (1977) and nahmias (1978) extended the approximation technique for productswith random lifetimes and for systems with a set-up cost.2.2 perishable inventory management for multi-echelon systemsclark and scarf (1960) were the first to model the optimal policy for a multi-period, multi-echelon inventory system subjected to stochastic demand. since then extensive research hasbeen done on multi-echelon inventory systems, yet research on multi-echelon inventory systemsfor perishable products is still limited due to its complexity. yen (1965) was the first to considera perishable inventory policy in a multi-echelon system using a stationary critical number orderpolicy. yen assumed that each regional location always receives the same proportional age ofinventory according to its order quantity. cohen, pierskalla and yen (1981) discussed periodicreview policies which focus on inventory allocation for a multi-echelon system that differentiatesproducts by age. their model did not remove the over-age stock from the inventory, but thepenalty cost associated with over-age stock was set sufficiently high to ensure small volumes ofover-age stock in the system. matta and sinha (1995) investigated the periodic review of a two-echelon system for non-perishable products. kanchanasuntorn and techanitisawad (2006)extended matta and sinha's model to include perishable items with fixed lifetimes using anapproximate periodic review policy.there is limited research on multi-echelon inventory management systems for perishableproducts with a maximum fixed lifetime beyond three periods and a random lifetime with decayaccording to a probability distribution. to our knowledge, when the scope is further narroweddown to a multi-echelon system that uses periodic review and considers lost sales, shrinkage,stochastic demand, non-zero lead-times and forecast accuracy, no relevant models have beenpublished. because of this and the fact that analytical approaches are generally complex anddifficult to implement for day-to-day operations, we felt that simulation would be a betterapproach to capture chiquita's supply chain. in section 2.3, we discuss the simulation modelingbriefly.2.3 simulationalthough an analytical approach is generally the preferred method in developing inventorypolicies, it becomes intractable when the states of the inventory are too complex to be expressedin equations. while analytical approaches may be impractical for a complex inventory system,computer simulation modeling can help to keep track of the states of the inventory and monitorthe interaction between the changes in each echelon of the supply chain.white and ingalls (2009) define a model as an entity that is used to represent some otherentity for some defined purpose. models are used when direct investigation of the actual systemis impractical or expensive. they describe simulation as an experimental approach to studyingmodels. a simulation modeler first creates a model that imitates the behaviors of the actualsystem, then experiments with the models with different inputs to observe the behavior, and atlast tries to understand, summarize, and generalize that behavior. because simulation modelinghelps researchers understand the behavior of complex models in a cost-effective way, simulationhas gained popularity and been widely used for academic research as well as for solving real-world problems. for example, snyder and shen (2006) used simulation models to gain insightson the differences between supply uncertainty and demand uncertainty in multi-echelon supplychains. schmitt and singh (2009) constructed a model that helps a large consumer productscompany to understand its vulnerability to disruption risk and the potential impact to customerservice.using a simulation model also helps to test the impact of increases in variability, widelyknown as the bullwhip effect phenomenon, on the forecast-driven multi-echelon system. simchi-levi (2000) defines the bullwhip effect as the increase in demand variability as the demandtravels up in a supply chain. the bullwhip effect is caused by multiple factors, including orderbatching and miscommunication of customers' true demand throughout the supply chain.law (2003) provided a concise yet comprehensive guide on conducting a successfulsimulation study. he discusses several key steps to developing a successful simulation study.these key steps are:1. formulate the problem. simulation modeling typically starts with formulating theproblem, defining the overall objective of the study and listing the specific questions thatthe study needs to address.2. construct a conceptual simulation model. once the objective is clearly defined, modelerscan begin constructing the conceptual model. modelers first need to collect informationto understand the system structure, and collect data to specify model parameters andprobability distributions. with a good understanding of the system structure and modelparameters, modelers can compile all the information to create a conceptual model.3. validate the conceptual model. once a conceptual model is built, all parties involvedshould validate the model by walking through the conceptual model to ensure it is anaccurate representation of the system.4. program the model. with the granted validity of the model, modelers can begin toprogram the conceptual model in programming language or in a commercial simulation-software product.5. validate the programmed model. while programming the model, modelers shouldvalidate the model with the existing system and perform sensitivity analyses to gaininsights on the model factors6. conduct and analyze simulation experiments. this step is to determine the details onhow to run the simulations, such as simulation run length, length of the warm-up period,and the number of independent runs. with all the steps completed, modelers can startconducting simulation runs and analyze the results of each run.7. document andpresent the simulation results. after an adequate number of simulationruns has been conducted, modelers should document the model and the simulation resultsin details and in a fashion that is easy to understand for the targeted audience.2.4 summarygiven the complex challenges that chiquita's fresh express supply chain faces, we determinedthat a simulation approach is more suitable than an analytical approach for the purpose of thisresearch. we used law's approach as the reference guidelines for developing our simulationmodel and describe that process in chapter 3, and we document and present the simulationresults in chapter 4. the details of the conceptual flow and user manual can be found inappendix a and b respectively.3 methodologyin this chapter, we outline how we developed a simulation model using arena simulationsoftware developed by rockwell automation to capture chiquita's fresh express multi-echelonsupply chain. we explain how we used the simulation model to better understand the impact ofperishability on costs and service levels. we include additional details on the conceptual flow ofsimulation model in appendix a and the user guide in appendix b.in order to develop a simulation model that replicates the fresh express supply chain, wefirst investigated the standard practices, performance metrics, and challenges that exist in thesupply chain. we determined the assumptions that we must make in order to develop the modeland the data that we would use to run the simulation. after we gained a good understanding ofthe key elements and data available in the fresh express supply chain, we began to build aconceptual model to capture all the processes involved in this multi-echelon supply chain. oncethe conceptual model was built and validated, we transformed the conceptual model into asimulation model in arena. after we programmed the simulation model in arena and created atesting plan, we were ready to conduct simulation runs to investigate the optimal inventorypolicy and the sensitivity of the costs.we use several abbreviations throughout this chapter and subsequent chapters. thecomplete list of abbreviations and their definitions can be found in table c. 1 of appendix c.recall that due to confidentiality concerns, all the numbers used throughout the thesis are forillustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of actual performance at chiquita.3.1 problem formulationusing law's approach as our reference guideline (law, 2003), discussed in section 2.3, westarted our research by interviewing the supply chain managers at chiquita to understand thebusiness processes, the material and information flows, and the challenges facing the freshexpress product line. as mentioned in the introduction, we focused our analysis on chiquita'splant in georgia, abc's dc in florida, and abc's retail stores served by the florida dc. wegathered information on the existing inventory replenishment process and the performancemetrics, namely the inventory shrinkage and the service levels, to understand the standardpractices of this supply chain. we then determined the necessary assumptions that we needed tomake to build our simulation model. we also mapped out what data is available and how thedata should be used in the model. the details of these steps are discussed in the followingsections.3.1.1 inventory replenishmentat the end of each day, each retail store reviews its inventory position (ip) and places an order tomaintain an inventory level of two or three days of on-hand inventory. if inventory is available,the dc typically will fulfill each order within 24 hours. the replenishment of the dc'sinventory is managed directly by chiquita through abc's vendor management inventory (vmi)system. supply chain managers at chiquita review the ip at abc's dc five times a week andplace appropriate orders to chiquita's plant. presently, chiquita reviews the dc's ip every dayexcept on wednesdays and fridays. for the purpose of further discussions, we will refer theactivities that chiquita performs (as a part of vmi) on behalf of the dc as the dc's activities.3.1.2 inventory shrinkageall the fresh express products carry a production date stamp. after 14 days from the productiondate, the product is considered no longer fresh for a consumer to purchase. at the end of eachday, each abc store removes and disposes any products produced 14 days ago from the shelf orthe inventory and considers the loss as inventory shrinkage costs.24additionally, each store also removes and disposes any products that age more quicklythan the expected 14-day of shelf life based on their appearance. the probability of a productneeding to be disposed prior to reaching the full 14 days increases as it ages. based on the inputsreceived from chiquita supply chain managers and the results from our initial simulation runs,we determined that an exponential growth probability best matches the shrinkage that chiquitaexperiences in reality. more information on this distribution is provided in section 4.1.the inventory shrinkage costs at the retail stores are absorbed by abc itself, but highinventory shrinkage costs could potentially damage the business relationship between abc andchiquita. currently, the total shrinkage at the retail stores is between 10 to 13% of the totalshipment volume from the dc to the retail stores, the goal is to reduce the shrinkage volume to8.5%.at the dc, abc has mandated an aging inventory shrinkage policy, in which abc doesnot ship any products that have less than six days of shelf life remaining from the dc to thestores. abc removes and discards any products produced eight days ago from inventory, and itcharges the loss back to chiquita. thus both abc and chiquita share a common interest incontrolling the inventory levels in a way that the potential inventory shrinkages are minimized atboth the retail stores and the dc.3.1.3 service levelsalthough both chiquita and abc would like to minimize inventory shrinkage, they also need tomaintain sufficient inventory levels as both of them strive for high customer service levels. thetarget average item fill rate (ifr) at the dc is 95%, which is calculated as the total demandfulfilled by the dc over the total quantity requested by each retail store on a daily basis. anyunfulfilled demand at the dc is recorded against chiquita's performance, and any unfulfilleddemand at the retail store is considered lost sales.presently abc uses an \\\"in stock or out of stock\\\" binary metric to measure the servicelevels at the retail stores. abc considers an item at the store to be \\\"in stock\\\" when the store hasenough inventory to fulfill the daily average demand; otherwise, it is considered \\\"out of stock\\\".for example, if 85 stores out of 100 stores have enough inventory to cover their daily demand foran item, the service level for that item is 85%. however, for a store that does not have enoughinventory to cover its daily demand, the current \\\"in stock or out of stock\\\" binary metric doesnot capture the partial demand fulfillment by the store. after careful consideration and discussionwith chiquita supply chain managers, we believe that an ifr would be a more appropriate metricfor measuring true service levels at the retail stores. therefore we use an ifr metric in themodel and assume that chiquita would still require a 95% ifr at the retail level.given the high demand volatility for packaged salads, the current forecasts generated byeach store and the dc each have a mean absolute percentage error of 25%. as a result, the dcand the retail stores often have to carry excessive inventory in order to ensure a high customerservice level. the main challenge for the fresh express supply chain is how to balance thetradeoff between potential inventory shrinkage costs, potential lost sales costs, and inventoryholding costs. in order to minimize these costs, chiquita must understand how perishabilityimpacts the inventory levels and the dynamics between all the factors in the system.3.1.4 assumptionsin our model, we include two retail stores served by abc's dc in florida. these two retailstores could represent actual stores, or they could represent two separate demand streamsaggregated from multiple stores. we assume that the chiquita plant does not have any rawmaterial shortage or capacity constraints at the plant; in other words, chiquita is always able toproduce and supply the quantity required by abc's dc. hence, chiquita's production plant isnot part of our research.our model replicates abc's and chiquita's standard ordering practices, in which the dcand the retail stores use a base-stock policy for replenishments. a base-stock policy implies aperiodic review policy, in which the dc and the retail stores each have an order-up-to-level(oul) for each product. the dc places orders five times a week and the retail stores placeorders every period, where a period is one day.our model assumes the product demand to be stochastic and normally distributed with aknown mean and variance. we feel justified this assumption because the normal distribution iscommonly used in many models in the literature. additionally, the demand used in the modelcan represent an aggregation of multiple individual products and/or stores, and the central limittheorem states that the mean sum of a large number of random variables will have a normaldistribution. additionally, we assume that the demand at each retail store is independent fromeach other.we assume that a first-in-first-out (fifo) policy is followed for the inventory at theretail stores and the dc. a fifo policy implies that older products are sold first to reducepossible shrinkage. although at the retail stores certain consumers may pick younger productsavailable from the back of the shelf over older products displayed in front, such consumerbehavior is difficult to predict and too complicated to incorporate in the scope of this thesis. wealso assume that the dc treats all the retail stores equally and does not prioritize a particularstore over another.the transportation lead time from the dc to the retail stores is assumed to be constant atone day (overnight), which means when the store places the order at the end of the day, if thestock is available, the order will arrive at the store the next morning, in time to be available forsale that day. the transportation lead time from the plant to the dc is assumed to bedeterministic and constant for each simulation. however, it is formulated as an input parameterso that the model can test the sensitivity of the transportation lead time from the plant to the dc.recall that the production lead time at the plant is 4 days.3.1.5 information flow and input calculationsfigure 3.1 below illustrates the information flow and the calculations conducted using the inputdata specified by the user. we explain the logic below.retail store 1 chiquita/dc retail store 2daily apply forecast apply foens appleo error (mape)ero(aeerrmp)rdfoecutri 3.1 hanfomtinflwan2nptcaclainat~apl forcas

the mean and standard deviation obtained from the point-of-sale (pos) data. the28.... ....... ... ... ..........random daily demand is used as the actual daily demand realized at each store. we then applythe forecast error (mean absolute percentage error, mape) to this demand and errantly obtain thedaily demand forecast.we create the daily demand forecast using a uniformly-distributed random multiplier.we generate the multiplier using a minimum and maximum value range. since the forecasterrors can be either positive or negative, the maximum value is two times the given mape, andthe minimum value is negative two times the given mape. using excel, uniformly-distributedrandom numbers are generated between the minimum and maximum values. this means theaverage of the multiplier is equal to zero but the average of the absolute value of the multiplier isequal to the mape. this random number is multiplied by the daily demand, thus providing thedaily demand forecast. by measuring the forecast accuracy weighted across the total volume, weverify if the given forecast error was correctly translated. even though in our calculation we usethe daily demand to produce the demand forecast, this daily demand forecast is used in the modelas the forecasts generated by each store prior to the arrival of the actual daily demand.the oul for each retail store is determined by the target days of on-hand inventory. theuser inputs the target number of days of inventory, and then the actual daily oul is calculatedby adding the demand forecast for that number of days forward. for example, if the inventorypolicy at the retail store is 2.5 days of on-hand inventory, the oul would be the sum of thedemand forecast for the next 2.5 days. depending on the ip at the time of the review, each retailstore would place an individual order equal to the oul minus the ip, or equal to zero if thatsubtraction yields a negative value. the ip is the on-hand inventory level after satisfyingdemand minus the shrinkage. since the order placed at the end of the day would arrive the nextmorning, there is no shipment in transit needed to be included in calculating the ip for the retailstores.to calculate the daily demand forecast at the dc, we apply the forecast error to theaggregated daily demand from the retail stores. the actual daily demand realized at the dc isthe aggregated total of individual orders from each retail store.the oul for the dc is determined using the same technique used to calculate the oulfor the retail stores. the oul for the dc is determined by the target days on-hand inventory atthe dc and the total lead time from placing the order to chiquita's plant to the delivery of theshipment. for example, if the target on-hand inventory at the dc is one day and the lead timefor chiquita to fulfill an order is five days, the oul at the dc would be the sum of the demandforecast for the next six days. depending on the ip, the dc would place an order equal to theoul minus the ip, or again equal to zero if that subtraction yields a negative value. the ip forthe dc is the on-hand inventory level after satisfying demand, minus the shrinkage, plus theshipments in transit to the dc.in figure 3.1, the numbers marked in red are input parameters that can be changed foreach simulation run. the input data is generated by a user in an excel file and the simulationmodel reads the data from this excel file. the use of excel file allows chiquita to use the modelto simulate other multi-echelon fresh express supply chains by simply changing the inputparameters there.3.2 conceptual modelthe information captured during the problem formulation step was critical for us to understandchiquita's supply chain system and decide the appropriate parameters, performance metrics, andlevel of detail for the model. next we developed a generic conceptual model that details thelogic of the system and would be applicable to most other multi-echelon systems withinchiquita.3.2.1 model logic-flowwe compiled the information captured during the interviews with chiquita's fresh expresssupply chain managers and divided the processes into eight steps. figure 3.2 provides asummary of the eight steps in the conceptual flow of our simulation model and we detail thelogic for each step below. we explain more details of each step in appendix a using additionalflow charts.step 1 step 2 step3 step4r - . -step5 step6 ste p 7 step8figure 3.2: overview of conceptual flowstep 1consumers purchase products at the retail stores on any given day, depleting the inventory usinga fifo product policy. at the end of each day, the retail stores remove the perished products... . ..........from their inventory. since backorders are not allowed in the system, any unfulfilled consumerdemand at the retail stores is considered lost sales.step 2the retail stores operate on a daily periodic-review policy with an oul. at the end of the day,each retail store checks its ip against the oul and, if necessary, places an order to the dc.step 3after aggregating the individual orders received from the two retail stores, the dc fulfills theorders using a fifo product policy for the inventory depletion on any given day. the orderfulfillment and inventory allocation for each retail store follows an order-splitting algorithm inorder to allocate material logically. the detail of this algorithm used in the model can be found insection a. 1 of appendix a.step 4the products shipped from the dc are received by the retail stores the morning after the order isplaced. since the maximum shelf life of a fresh express product is 14 days, in the simulationmodel we created 14 virtual bins at the retail stores. each bin contains fresh express productswith distinct age-groups. for example, bin 1 contains products that are one day old at the retailstore, bin 2 contains products that are two day old at the retail store, etc. using the differentinventory age bins, we ensure the accurate measure of shelf life, appropriate inventory transfers,and accurate calculation of shrinkage costs.the bin age at the retail store does not include the transportation lead times; in otherwords, the actual shelf life of the product is its bin age at the retail store plus the transportationlead time from the plant to the dc and from the dc to the retail store. for example, if the dchas products that are 10 days old and it ships these products to the retail stores, we add that stockto the appropriate bin 11 at the retail stores as the actual shelf life must consider the one daytransportation lead time from the dc to the retail store. this allows for flexibility of lead timeinput parameters; the model structure does not have to change in order to test different shipmentlead times to the dc.each bin at the retail stores is assigned a shrinkage probability according to the trueproduct age, so that every day a percentage of products in each bin may be discarded. thesediscarded products are unusable due to perishability.step 5the dc periodically reviews its ip and creates an order to chiquita's plant if the ip at the dc isless than its oul, as mentioned in section 3.1.1.step 6the dc receives a shipment from the plant according to production and transportation leadtimes. for example, if the total production and transportation lead time is five days, the dc willreceive the shipment from the plant in the morning of the fifth day after the day when the orderwas placed. using the same approach described for the retail stores, we created 14 virtual bins atthe dc in the simulation model. the model conducts the inventory transfer in the same manneras was described for the retail stores in step 4.the model also provides flexibility for users to change the review schedule if needed. inother words, instead of reviewing the ip at the dc every day except wednesday and friday, theusers may change the model to review the ip based on a different review schedule.step 7at the end of each day, relevant costs and key performance indexes (kpis), as listed below, arecaptured and measured for each retail store and the dc. lost sales cost is not considered at thedc because abc operates its dc as a cost center, not a profit center. the dc charges a fee forproducts shipped to the retail stores, but the margin is only used to cover the warehousing andshipping expenses and not considered a sales profit. hence, any unfulfilled demand at the dc isnot charged a lost sales cost. however, as explained in section 3.1.3, the dc does require that itmaintains an average ifr of 95%.relevant costs:\\\" holding costs\\\" shrinkage costs* lost sales costskpis:\\\" item fill ratee shrinkage units* lost sales units* inventory positions* inventory levelsdifferent test scenarios are needed to compare these costs and kpis, and to evaluate thetrade-offs between them. the objective is to find the parameters that result in the lowest totalrelevant cost while satisfying the minimum ifr.step 8at the end of each day, any inventory left at the retail stores and the dc ages by one day. inother words, the product shelf life remaining is reduced by one day. in the model, we shuffleinventory bins or transfer the inventory to the next bin to ensure accurate measure of product ageand associated shrinkage costs. for example, at the end of the day, products that are 3 days oldwill now become 4 days old; products that are 4 days old will now become 5 days old, etc.products that are 14 days old will no longer be considered fresh for consumers to purchase andwill be discarded as shrinkage.additionally, as mentioned in section 3.1.2, some products may age more quickly thanthe expected 14-day of shelf life. thus a fraction of the products would be removed from theinventory according to the shrinkage profile.3.2.2 validationafter we mapped out the eight steps in the process, we presented the conceptual model tochiquita's supply chain managers who validated that the model accurately represents the freshexpress supply chain. we also validated the model flow with supply chain and simulationexperts that include faculty and students at mit.3.3 model programmingwe programmed the conceptual model using arena, a discrete-event systems simulationsoftware. we choose arena because we have previous experience with the software andchiquita already has licenses to arena. in addition, arena integrates well with microsoft office;the users can have arena read and write from or to excel spreadsheets, making arena more user-friendly for day-to-day business operations.figure 3.3 below shows the screen shots of our simulation model programmed in arena.the top section of the figure highlighted in red represents the logic for the retail stores. themiddle portion of the figure represents the logic for the dc, the section of the figure highlightedin yellow represents the logic for the order creation process at the plant by the dc. finally, thebottom section of the figure represents the process in arena to read the input parameters fromand write the outputs into the excel file. please refer to appendix a for the more details ofsimulation model in arena.figure 3.3: arena model screen shot3.4 arena model verification and validationwe verified and validated the arena model to ensure that the model sufficiently matches realityand performs according to the intended design. we verified the model by monitoring whether. .... ...... ... ...........jiwj r1i j-j i-j 1--ithe model behaves as expected under different circumstances to ensure the conceptual model wascorrectly translated into the arena model. for example, we raised the inventory level at theretails stores and subsequently saw higher shrinkage volumes and holding costs at the retailstores.we validated the programmed model with supply chain managers from chiquita andsupply chain experts at the mit. the experts were convinced that our programmed modelsufficiently matches with the reality of chiquita's fresh express supply chain system.additionally, we validated the model by comparing outputs from the simulation model withhistorical performance metrics provided by chiquita. we discuss the results in chapter 4.3.5 simulation testingfor our research, twenty independent simulation replications was deemed to be a sufficientnumber for producing results with tight enough 95% confidence intervals for performancemetrics. the duration of each simulation run was 365 days, or one year. the system producedstable results after the simulation ran for thirty days, thus we determined the warm-up period forour model should be thirty days. for more details on the simulation run parameters, please referto appendix b.we developed a testing plan containing different scenarios specifically to answer thethree key questions described in section 1.2. our testing plan focused on finding the optimalinventory policies for the retail stores and the dc. once we determined the inventory policiesthat resulted in the lowest total relevant costs while meeting the minimum ifr, we tested thesensitivity of the system to different percentage of forecasting errors and different transportationlead times from the plant to the dc.we used the aggregated demands from one of fresh express' main product families toconduct all our simulation runs based on a suggestion by chiquita's supply chain managers. theresults generated from using this product family should provide a good overall representation ofthe whole fresh express product lines.4 resultsin this chapter we discuss the results of our simulation runs and the interpretation of theseresults. our objective was to find an optimal inventory policy that results in the lowest totalrelevant cost while satisfying the minimum ifr required at the retail stores and the dc. we alsotested the sensitivity of the system to better understand the potential impact of some of the inputparameters may have on the system under the optimal policy.in section 4.1 we describe the input parameters and the base scenario details. in section4.2 we discuss the simulation results under different inventory levels at the retail stores and at thedc and determine the optimal inventory solution. in section 4.3 we test the sensitivity of thesystem under the optimal policy to the forecast errors, and in section 4.4 we test the sensitivityof the system under the optimal policy to the transportation lead time from the plant to the dc.in appendix d, we present additional results of the sensitivity analysis such as cost break-downat each echelon.4.1 input parameters and base scenariotable 4.1 lists the retail stores' input parameters and their definitions. each of these

or used in chiquita's fresh expresssupply chain. as explained in section 3.5, for our scenarios we use data from one of chiquita'smain product family, so the parameters are defined in table 4.2 in terms of that product family.we conducted the simulation using these actual values, however, in table 4.2, the pricing andcost information has been manipulated in the interest of confidentiality concerns. the existinginventory policy at the retail stores is to maintain 2.5 days of on-hand inventory. we choose onestore with high demand volume and another store with low demand volume to capture thedynamics of different types of demands in the multi-echelon system. retail store 1 represents............... : ...  .the store with the high demand volume and retail store 2 represents the store

means that even for products that are less than 14 days old,an exponentially increasing fraction of inventory is discarded at the end of each day due toperishability. the exponentially growing shrinkage probabilities were obtained using excelsolver to find the parameter that should result in 10-13% shrinkage, which is in the range of the................................... ::::..::::::::      .... ..... .. .  ..... shrinkage percentage experienced at the retail stores in reality. equation 4.1 presents the formulafor x, which is the shrinkage probability for a given age. the parameter a is determined in termsof k and the maximum value for t, the product shelf life, according to equation 4.3. thus excelsolver finds only one unknown parameter, k. in our case, the maximum product shelf life is 14days, resulting in 14 shrinkage probabilities.x = aekt or in x = kt + in a (equation 4.1)k -in (maximum shrinkage probability )-ln (minimum shrinkage probability ) (equation 4.2)maximum

constant determined according to equation 4.2a is determined according to equation 4.3 and is the initial value of xthe maximum shrinkage probability is 100%. seeking a 12% total shrinkage volume,using excel solver, we obtained k=0.2535 and a=0.0287, which produce the appropriateexponentially growing shrinkage probabilities from day 1 to day 14. additionally, abc'smandated inventory shrinkage policy at the retail stores is to discard 100% of any product thatare 14 days old regardless the appearance of the product. therefore, the value of parameter kobtained by excel solver is such that we have an exponentially growing shrinkage profile fromday 1 to day 14 and we have 100% fixed shrinkage probability at day 14. the actual shrinkageprobabilities obtained and used in the model are listed in table 4.2.we ran the simulation for the base scenario with these shrinkage probabilities andvalidated that these probabilities indeed produce aggregated total shrinkage volume at the retailstores within the valid range of 10% to 13%. table 4.3 below indicates the observed andvalidated shrinkage volume for each store and their aggregate total.table 4.3: retail stores base

interest of confidentiality concerns asin case of the retail stores. however, we conducted the simulation using actual numbers for basescenario. the existing inventory policy at the dc is to maintain 1 day of on-hand inventory.. ................................................................ ..however, since the lead time from when the order is placed to chiquita's plant until the order isdelivered to the dc is five days, chiquita must maintain a total six day worth of inventory in thepipeline. the dc does not check the appearance of the products, thus the shrinkage probabilityat the dc does not follow the exponentially growing shrinkage probability. the mandatedinventory shrinkage policy at the dc is to discard 100% of any product that have less than sixdays of shelf life remaining regardless the appearance of the product. therefore, any productthat has less than six days of shelf life remaining has a shrinkage probability of 100%. the lostsales cost per unit is

................................................4.2 optimal inventory levelswe first determined the reasonable ranges of inventory levels at the retail stores and the dcseparately. we then performed simulation tests by varying both target inventory levelssimultaneously to determine overall optimal multi-echelon inventory levels. an optimal solutionmeans the inventory levels resulted in the lowest total relevant costs for the system, which is thesum of the inventory holding costs, the lost sales costs, and the shrinkage costs, while satisfyingthe minimum ifr (95%) at the dc.4.2.1 inventory at the retail storeswe first ran the simulation with the base scenario inputs from tables 4.2 and 4.5, then we heldthe dc inventory level constant and changed the days of on-hand inventory levels at the retailstores to understand at which values the inventory policy would result in reasonable costs yetstill satisfy the minimum requirement of 95% ifr. we tested the target days on hand inventorylevels at the retail stores in the increments of /2 integer values between 2 to 5 days. we testedthe increments of % integer values because those are the smallest possible increments that abcoperates with, and we set the minimum at % of a day because the store would not acceptcomplete stock-outs and always need some inventory on hand to satisfy demand.table 4.6 presents the total relevant costs at different values of target days on-handinventory and figure 4.1 and 4.2 graphs the results. we can see that if we only consider theretail stores, 1.5 days of on-hand inventory results the lowest cost and still satisfies therequirement of 95% ifr.table 4.6: inventor targets at the retail storestarget onhand days at retal stom 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5dcifr 99.1 99.6 98.4 95.3 91.7 85.9 80.5

.. . ................................ ............... figure 4.1 shows the effect of target on-hand inventory level at the retail stores on theifr at each echelon. as the target on-hand inventory at the retail stores increases, the ifrs atthe retail stores increases and the ifr at the dc decreases. our analysis indicates that the ifr atthe dc decreases with increasing target on-hand inventory levels at the retail stores because thestores order farther into the future with less accuracy which means the dc's ability to fill ordersaccurately is reduced. the shape of curve suggests that the ifrs at the retail stores remain above95% for target on-hand days that are greater than 1.5 when the base on-hand inventory target of 1day is used at the dc.considering figure 4.2, we observe a clearly convex curve with the optimal solutionachieved when the target on-hand inventory is equal to 1.5 days. for the target on-hand daysless than 1.5 days, the total relevant cost for the system is higher due to higher lost sales costs atthe retail stores and higher inventory holding costs at the dc. for the target on-hand daysgreater than 1.5, the total relevant cost for the system increases as a result of the increases of theinventory holding costs and the shrinkage costs.based on the costs and ifrs observed, we determined that the reasonable range for targeton-hand inventory at the retail stores is between 2 to 4.5 days. this is because for target on-hand days greater than 4.5, the ifrs at the retail store remain relatively constant but the totalrelevant cost for retail stores and the system increases.4.2.2 inventory at the dcusing the same approach described for the retails stores, we changed only the days of on-handinventory at the dc and held the retailer levels constant at their base value (2.5 days). we testedthe target inventory levels at the dc in the increments of 1/2 integer values between 0 to 5 days.table 4.7 presents the total relevant costs at different values of target days on-hand inventory atthe dc. figures 4.3 and 4.4 graph the effects of inventory targets at the dc on the ifrs and thecosts.table 4.7: inventory targ ets at the dctarget onhand days at dc

retail stores both increase as the target on-hand inventory atthe dc increases. the shape of curve suggests that the ifr at the dc remains above 95% fortargets of on-hand days that are greater than 1.5 days.the cost curves for both the dc and the system are increasing with the lowest-costsolution achieved when the target on-hand inventory at the dc is equal to 0 days. however, thislowest-cost solution is not feasible because it does not satisfy the constraint of a minimum 95%ifr at the dc. for the target on-hand days greater than 0, the total relevant cost for the systemincreases as a result of the increases of the inventory holding costs and the shrinkage costs atboth the dc and the retail stores. as the target days on-hand inventory increases, the dc holdsmore inventory of an older age, which is then sent to the retail stores resulting in highershrinkage costs at the retail stores.based on the costs and ifrs observed, we determined that the reasonable range for targeton-hand inventory at the dc is between 0 to 4.5 days. this is because for target on-hand daysgreater than 4.5, the ifr at the dc remains relatively constant but the total relevant cost for thedc and the system shows an increasing trend. the major cost contribution comes from theincreasing inventory holding cost at the dc.4.2.3 optimal inventory at the retail stores and the dcalthough our simulation runs described in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 provide the optimal inventorypolicies at the retail stores and at the dc separately, these policies fail to consider the potentialimpact that the inventory levels have on each other. in order to find the global optimal inventorypolicy for the multi-echelon system, we must consider different combination of retail stores' anddc's inventory policies. as explained in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, we used the individualechelon optimization results to narrow down the number of possible combinations. weconducted simulation testing to seek the combination of inventory policies at the retail store andthe dc that would result in the lowest total relevant cost for the system while still meeting theminimum 95% ifr required at the dc. table 4.8 presents the total relevant costs at differentvalues of target days on-hand inventory at the retail stores and the dc, with feasible solutions(those with ifrs greater than 95% at all echelons) highlighted in green. table 4.9 presents theassociated ifr at the dc. the base policy currently used by chiquita is highlighted in red forthese tables and all that follow. the results suggest that the optimal solution is for the retailstores and the dc to have target on-hand inventory levels of 1.5 days and 0.5 days, respectively.this yields the lowest total relevant costs while still having an ifr

for the optimal solution are highlighted in blue for all tables.table 4.9 also indicates other feasible solutions (cells marked in green) with more than95% ifr at the dc, but these solutions do not yield the lowest total relevant cost for the system.additionally, table 4.9 indicates that at the current base policy, only a 91.7% ifr is achieved bythe dc. this is consistent with current observations by chiquita that their ifr values at the dcare not satisfactory.tables 4.10 and 4.11 indicate the ifrs at each retail store for different target on-handlevels. we observe that except for the combinations with cells marked in green (which indicatethe feasible solution), the ifr at the retail stores deteriorates below 95%. retail store 2 has ahigher ifr for lower values for target days on-hand inventory at the dc. this may be due to thefact that its demand is half that of retail store 1 and thus a larger proportion of its orders may besatisfied in full by the dc. clearly, the target on-hand inventory policy of less than 1.5 days atthe retail stores results in the higher lost sales cost for the system increasing the total relevantcost.table 4.10: item fill rate at retail store

theimpact that dc has on the total relevant costs for the system. for these combinations, the majorcost contribution comes from the higher inventory holding and shrinkage costs at the retail storeswhen each retail store's target on-hand inventory is high, or from lost sales costs when eachretail store's target on-hand inventory is too low. the shrinkage costs at the retail stores becomecomparable to or even greater than the inventory holding costs for the combination of highertarget on-hand days at both the retail stores and the dc. this holds true especially forcombinations

statistics for the kpi's for the base policy and theoptimal policy. we ran the simulation for twenty independent replications or iterations to obtainreliable results. an explanation for the content of the columns is as follows:.. . .. ... ................................................................................................................................................................................ : .. . .. .... ..... i. average: this value indicates the average for the output variable over all twentyiterations.ii. half-width: this value helps to determine the reliability of the results for the outputvariable from all twenty iterations. this number is half of the 95% confidence intervalfor the true mean of the given kpi. thus the output indicates that the true mean is withinthe range of the observed sample mean

4.18, we observe that the total relevant cost ateach retailer and for the system is statistically significantly lower and the half-widths are smallerfor the optimal policy as compared to the base policy. the dc total relevant costs are notstatistically significantly different, yet the dc ifr is statistically significantly higher. the95.24% ifr at the dc for the optimal policy with half-width of 0.45 is significantly is betterthan the 91.74% ifr with half-width of 0.59 for the base policy. further, the smaller confidenceintervals for the ifr at the dc and the total relevant cost for the system indicate that optimalpolicy would improve the reliability of the performance of the system and yield the lowest costsolution as compared to the base policy.there is a small decrease in ifrs at the retail store under the optimal policy as comparedto the base policy, although these ifrs under the optimal policy are still greater than 95%. thisis because the optimal solution trades off the lost sales cost with the shrinkage costs andinventory holding costs at the retail stores in order to find the lowest cost solution for the wholesystem. for example, in the case of retail store 1, we see that the shrinkage cost is reducedfrom $23.04 to $8.37 and the inventory holding costs are reduced from $26.16 to $10.48 whencomparing the base policy with optimal policy respectively. the lost sales cost increases from$1.45 for the base policy to $8.62 for the optimal policy. overall, the total relevant cost at retailstore 1 is now $27.46 for the optimal policy as compared to $50.64 for the base policy, whichtranslates into cost reduction of $23.18. additionally, the ifr under the optimal policy at theretail store 1 is 97.05% which is still greater than 95%. this means under the base policy, themajor portion of the cost comes from the shrinkage costs and inventory holding costs.considering the cost reductions across the whole system, the optimal policy yields a30.7% reduction in costs while maintaining the ifr greater than 95% at each echelon. themodel optimizes the whole system by capturing the dynamic effects of perishability andinventory levels at each echelon, resulting in significant savings without sacrificing the servicelevels.4.3 sensitivity to the forecast errorsusing the optimal inventory policies obtained during the simulation runs described in section4.2.3, 0.5 days inventory target at the dc and 1.5 days inventory target at the retail stores, wetested the sensitivity of the system to the forecast errors. testing the sensitivity of the optimalinventory policy with respect to the forecast errors demonstrates the potential benefits ofincreased forecast accuracy on reducing the inventory-related costs.4.3.1 forecast error for dc's demand forecastwe conducted the sensitivity analysis by conducting simulation runs with the following inputsfor forecast error for the dc's demand: 0, 5, 15, 25, 35, 50, 65, and 80%. table 4.19 presentsthe results for

dc is very sensitive to the dc's forecast error ascompared to the ifr at the retail stores, and the ifrs at both the dc and the retail storesdecrease as the forecast accuracy deteriorates beyond 25%. this occurs because the oul for thedc, which is dependent upon dc's forecast, becomes less accurate and the shrinkage volume atthe dc increases as forecast accuracy deteriorates. this affects the availability of the inventoryat the dc and hence its ability to fulfill orders received from the retail stores. thus ifrs at boththe dc and the retail stores deteriorate for dc's forecast error beyond 25%.for the dc's forecast error less than 25%, the inventory level at the dc is reduced butretail stores still have their own forecast error, so retail stores still tend to order more form thedc. thus the ifr at the dc deteriorates because the retail stores order more than they need to,suggesting the presence of the bullwhip phenomenon.... ....

at the dc and the retail stores can reduce the costs significantly and improvethe respective ifrs drastically. the forecast accuracy at the dc has greater impact than theforecast accuracy at the retail stores on the total relevant cost of the system. because of theproduction and transportation lead time at the plant, the system is more sensitive to the dc'sforecast error. the longer production and transportation lead time at the plant means moreforecast error will be taken into account while calculating the dc's oul as opposed tocalculations with shorter lead times. this translates into the increased inventory holding cost atthe dc.however, the forecast accuracy at the retail stores has a greater impact than the forecastaccuracy at the dc on dc's ifr. even if the forecast accuracy at the dc is improved, if theretail stores have poor forecast accuracy then the dc's ifr will still suffer and the total relevant.. .. .....   . ......................  .... x ..

sensitivity of the total relevant cost to the transportation lead time from the plant tothe dc helps demonstrate the benefits of using expedited shipping services. we conducted thisexperiment with transportation lead times from the plant to the dc of 1 through 7 days. theproduction lead time is constant at 4 days which results in a cumulative lead time from the plantto the dc of 5 to 11 days.

of perishability on total inventory costs andto establish the optimal inventory policy for the multi-echelon fresh express supply chain. inthis chapter we present the challenges for perishable inventory system in a multi-echelon supplychain, the insights drawn from the use of our simulation model, and an outline for the futureextensions.5.1 challenges for perishable inventory systems in a multi-echelon supply chainthe major challenges in perishable inventory management systems reside in tracking theinventory distribution of different age-groups. the multi-echelon system further complicates theissue as the interaction between each echelon of the supply chain makes the issue dynamic anddifficult to monitor and understand. addressing these issues analytically requires extensivecomputations, thus analytical approaches are usually impractical for day-to-day operations in acomplex inventory system.utilizing a simulation model is extremely useful in dealing with perishable inventory inmulti-echelon supply chains because tracking the inventory distribution and the inventorytransfer becomes relatively simple using computer software. a computer simulation model alsohelps the user to monitor the interactions and influence between each echelon of the supplychain. additional benefits of a simulation approach are that we can test the sensitivity of thesystem to varying conditions, and that we can obtain 95% confidence intervals for the outputvariables, which indicate the reliability of the estimate.5.2 key insightswe have discussed many of our key results in chapter 4, and we highlight key insights in thissection.5.2.1 service level at the dc vs. inventory at the retail storesthe simulations reveal that the ifr at the dc is sensitive to the target days on-hand inventory atthe retails stores. as the target days on-hand inventory at the retail stores increases, the ifr atthe dc decreases significantly. the dynamics of the demand variability, the forecast errors, andthe shrinkage in the multi-echelon system amplify as the target days on-hand inventory at theretail stores increases. as a result of the dynamics of these three factors, the ifr at the dcdeteriorates when the target days on-hand inventory at the retail stores increases past two days.the model suggests the retail store to keep its inventory less than two days to minimize theupstream impact of the demand variability, the forecast errors, the production schedule and theshrinkage.5.2.2 base scenario policy vs. optimal inventory policyone of the three key questions posed by chiquita is what the optimal inventory levels areconsidering forecast accuracy, transportation lead-time, inventory carrying cost, lost sales costsand inventory shrinkage costs due to product perishability. our simulation model considers allthese factors and determines that the optimal inventory policy would be to set the target days on-hand inventory to be 0.5 days at the dc and 1.5 days at the retail stores. comparing this optimalsolution to the current inventory policy, the inventory policy determined by our simulation modelreduces the total relevant cost by 30.7%, reduces the shrinkage below 8.5%, and maintains theifr above the required 95% at all echelons.chiquita has been considering moving to a cross-dock policy at the dc, which means thedc will not carry any inventory. our model indicates that by removing inventory from the dc,a cross-dock policy would reduce the total relevant costs by approximately 0.05%. comparingwith the 30.7% cost saving from the optimal policy, an additional 0.05% saving is relativelyinsignificant. in addition, our model shows that the cross-dock policy would reduce the ifr atboth the retail stores. in particular, the ifr at the retail store 1 would be reduced from 97.1% to93.2%, below the target ifr of 95%. therefore, based on the results, we would not recommendchiquita and abc to introduce a cross-dock policy at the dc unless it makes other changes to itsordering and logistics to maintain sufficient ifrs.5.2.3 service levels vs. inventory costanother question posed by chiquita is the trade-off between service levels and inventory cost.as we expected, the service levels and inventory costs have a positive correlation. we determineour model's optimal inventory policy by selecting the policy that results in the lowest totalrelevant cost and still meets the minimum service level of 95% ifr. the optimal inventorypolicy improves the ifr at the dc from 91.74% to 95.24%, while the ifr at the retail storesdecreases from 99% to 97%.although the ifr at the retail stores decreases by approximately 2%, 97% is stillconsidered high customer service level. however, the impact of a reduction of 2% in ifr onconsumer satisfaction and good-will are not captured in our model. chiquita and abc shouldgain a better understanding of the potential impact on consumer behavior and future sales beforeimplementing the optimal inventory policy suggested by our simulation model.overall, the 30.7% cost savings are significant enough for chiquita and abc to considerreplacing the current inventory policy with the optimal inventory policy found in our model. themajority of the cost reduction comes from the reductions in inventory holding costs andinventory shrinkage costs across the system, especially at the retail stores.additionally, the confidence intervals (95%) determined by our model for the ifr andthe total relevant cost for the system are tighter in the case of the optimal inventory policy ascompared to the confidence intervals in the base scenario policy. the tighter confidenceintervals indicate less variability in the system performance.5.2.4 effect of forecast error on the relevant costs and the service levelthe third question posed by chiquita is the effect of forecast error on inventory-related costs.we found that the system is very sensitive to forecast errors, especially the forecast errors fromthe dc. in general, as the forecast accuracy deteriorates, the ifr at the dc and the retail storesdecreases and the relevant cost of the system increases. therefore, chiquita and abc shouldconsider investing significant efforts to improve the forecast accuracies at the dc and the retailstores. additionally, improving the forecast accuracy at the dc alone may not address the issuesufficiently because the dc's inventory is ultimately impacted by the orders and forecastscreated by the retail stores. the ifr at the dc is more sensitive to the forecast error at the retailstores than to the dc's forecast error. to maximize the cost savings and improve theperformance of the whole system, we recommend that chiquita work with abc tosimultaneously improve the forecast accuracy at both the dc and the retail stores.5.2.5 effect of transportation lead time on the relevant costs and service levelthe system is sensitive to the transportation lead time since the transportation lead time directlyimpacts the products' lifetime at the dc and at the retail stores. our model demonstrates that asthe transportation lead time increases, the shrinkage in the system increases significantly. thisfurther results in the increased lost sales at the retail stores and reduced ifr at the retail stores79and the dc. overall, the total relevant cost for the system increases and the ifr at each echelondeteriorates. since the system is sensitive to the transportation lead time, chiquita should notrelax the current lead time and should continue to keep the transportation lead time as short aspossible to maximize the products' available lifetime at the dc and the retail stores.5.3 extension of the model and future researchfurther research on perishable product supply chains can be conducted by relaxing theassumptions of our model. we have demonstrated the benefits of quantitative approach toimproving the service levels at each echelon and reducing the total relevant cost of the system.further extension of our research by exploring the following possibilities can extend the benefitsto the perishable product supply chains.5.3.1 mandated shrinkage policy at the dccurrently, abc has mandated an inventory shrinkage policy at the dc, in which any productthat has less than six days of shelf life remaining should be removed from the dc's inventory.testing the sensitivity of the system with respect to this mandated inventory shrinkage policy atthe dc could help chiquita to understand the impact of this policy on the ifr at each individualechelon and the total relevant cost for the system.5.3.2 other product familiesour simulation is based on one of fresh express' main product families. the results generatedfrom using this product family should provide a good overall representation of the whole freshexpress product lines. however, chiquita can use the simulation model to test other productfamilies or each individual product to gain a deeper understanding of its supply chain.5.3.3 other fresh express supply chainsour simulation is also based on one of fresh express' main customers, which we refer to asabc inc. this supply chain is similar to chiquita's other supply chains for other customers.however, some of the inventory policies, such as abc's mandated shrinkage policy at the dc,might be different for other customer's supply chains. chiquita can conceivably change theinput parameters in the model to determine the optimal inventory policy for its other supplychains.5.3.4 demand correlation among complementary productsin our model, we assumed independent demand that is normally distributed for each product, butdifferent demand distributions can be considered for further research. for example, it is possibleto analyze and incorporate correlated demand for complementary products.5.3.5 first in first out policyour model assumes a fifo product policy; however, in reality if there are products withdifferent lifetime displayed on the shelf, some consumers would look for and purchase theyounger products. such consumer behavior is not captured in our current model. chiquita andits customers can either develop rules to expand our model to capture such behaviors or developstore shelf stocking policies to better control consumers' purchasing behaviors if needed.5.3.6 production capacity of the plantin our model, we assumed that the plant has unlimited production capacity to fulfill dc's orders,but this assumption can be relaxed if an additional echelon is built into the model. this may bevaluable since the plant serves other dc's if it has limited production capacity5.4 summarywe conclude that for multi-echelon perishable inventory management problems, simulation canbe extremely helpful. our research demonstrates that simulation modeling can quantify varioustrade-offs involved in making inventory management decisions for perishable products. it isextremely valuable to simulate reality and test the sensitivity of the system before decisions aremade by managers. simulation modeling can lead to optimal solutions that would reduce thesystem costs significantly while improving the system performance significantly.reference listclark, a. j., and scarf, h. 1960. optimal policies for a multi-echelon inventory problem.management science, 6 (4), 475-490.cohen m. a.

arenab.3.2 built-in reports in arenab.3.3 user customized results in excelb.4 sensitivity testing setupfor additional information on arena software and the features offered beyond the scopeof this appendix, we recommend the user to refer to the manual provided by rockwellautomation, the manufacturer of arena software.b.1 introduction to the fresh express arena simulation modelarena is a discrete-event systems simulation tool and it was used to program and simulatechiquita's fresh express supply chain for the purposes of this thesis. a microsoft excel filewas used feed the input parameters into this arena model. in this excel file, the model user canspecify the input parameters specific to each individual echelon of supply chain that wediscussed in chapter 4. the arena simulation model reads these input parameters beforerunning the simulation. to that end, we have integrated the excel file with the arena simulationmodel.additionally, the user needs to setup replication parameters for the arena simulationmodel. at the end of simulation runs, arena provides results for the output variables usingarena's built-in reports. users can also obtain results for the specific output variables at therequired level of granularity, provided a specific output file and the output format are specified tothe model by the intended user. the sections below provide more details regarding the processinvolved.b.2 setting up the modelthis section provides details regarding the input parameters to be specified by the model user.b.2.1 excel input parameters for the supply chainas mentioned in section b. 1, the user needs to specify the input parameters specific to thesupply chain in file the inputdatafile.xls. figure b. 1 (a) shows the screenshot of this file andthe input parameters to be specified by the user. the user needs to specify a valid data value foreach of the cells marked in yellow. we have defined a valid range for each of these input datacells. if the user enters any incorrect value (for example, negative values) into these cells, aninput error messages twill appear to the user. the user needs to resolve any errors that areprompted before proceeding to the actual arena simulation.the user is allowed to enter data only in the inputdata tab. the testme tab as shown infigure b. 1 (b) is protected and used for the calculations explained in section 3.1.5 (figure 3.1).the arena simulation model reads the data from this tab. figure b.1 (c) shows how to select andsetup the file inputdatafile.xls in arena.0 c -(d wlwie cl 9k kitak4-jqoga azt

excel file with input parameters as mentioned section b.2. 1, the user alsoneeds to setup the replication parameters for the simulation model. figure b.2 shows thescreenshot from arena where the user needs to specify these parameters.hi dtvie* t0,04 amw~~ otec (e wmndoa h*irun setuprun speed i fcomoi pepospned pmwnts repleabon pawame ma suessat dae and tuneajuay -2-10 12 0000 amwamvp ped tune

number ofreplications: this indicates the number of independent iterations orreplications the simulation model is required to perform before producing final set ofresults. we recommend 20 replications to capture the variability in the system andproduce reliable results. this means that the simulation model will run twenty times with95.............. ....... . . .. ................... . -a different set of random data every time and at the end of 2 0 th replication it will producethe results for user-specified output variables.ii. start date and time: this indicates the beginning date and time for the simulation run.for example, if we want to conduct the simulation for 365 days in future, the start dateand time indicates the very first day on which the simulation begins.iii. warm-up period: in general, for simulating the situations that do not start withoutinventory or material in process, the user needs specify warm-up period. for thesimulation model discussed in this thesis, we recommend 30 days of warm-up, which wedetermined through tests. this means that the statistics collected over first 30 days willnot be counted towards final performance measures reported at the end of simulationruns. in other words, the simulation model requires 30 days to stabilize the system andstart performing close to the average conditions of the system that match with reality.iv. replication length: this indicates the duration for which user would like to conduct thesimulation. for example, we wanted to collect data from the simulation for 1 year.given that we had 30 days of warm-up, the replication length was set to 395 days. theuser needs to account for the warm-up period while setting the replication length.b.3 running the modelafter successfully completing the process in sections b.l and b.2, the user can proceed torunning the model.b.3.1 running the model in arenathe user should first check the model for any errors as a routine procedure. if no changes arebeing made to the model and procedure mentioned above is correctly followed by the user, thereshould be no errors. figure b.3 shows how to check the model for errors in arena. the user96should get the message no errors or warnings in model as shown below. if there are any errors,the user should review those errors and resolve them before running the simulation model.fie edt vitw tools anange object widow help17 c~

in figure b.3. alternatively, the user can select the arrowsas shown in figure b.4 below to start the simulation run in normal mode or fast-forward mode.running the model in fast-forward modes saves significant amount of time. if the user wants toview the animation, then simulation speed can be controlled (slowed down) using the bar shownin figure b.4. using animation increases the time required

the output variablesspecified by the user. the arena software prompts the message shown in figure b.5, indicatingthat results are ready for the user to review. the option to enable or disable the display of resultsat the end of simulation run can be set by the user under reports as shown in figure b.2.arenathe simulation has run to completion.,- would you like to see the results?yes nofigure b.5: result message prompt by arenain general, the user can specify some statistics to be collected under project parametersas shown in figure b.2. figure b.6 and b.7 indicate how to collect statistics for already-existingvariables in the model and the custom variables defined by the user for the purpose of this model.for most of the variables in this model, the statistics collection is turned on by selecting thereport statistics check-box for variable under the basic processes panel as shown in the figureb.6. the user can see the complete list of variables in the model and select the statistics forvariables that are of interest. additionally, the user can specify new or custom variables that areof interest under the statistics option which is listed under the advanced process panel as shownin figure b.7. we have created four custom variables, which are the total relevant cost for thedc, retail store 1, retail store 2 and the system.file edit view tools arrange object run

in the figure b.9b. 3.3 user-customized results in excelthe user can develop an additional program in the arena model for exporting any specific outputvariables at a different level of detail (daily, monthly, etc.) than the level reported in arena'sbuilt-in reports if needed. we developed a program to export daily results for few output100co q>variables as shown in figure b.10. the default export starts after warm-up period of 30 days,but the user can change it that if needed. for example, if the user is interested in reviewing theifr at the dc for each individual day simulated in arena and for all twenty iterations, then theexcel file outputdatafile.xls will contain those results as shown in figure b. 11. the user needsto specify this filename in arena as shown in figure b. 1 (c). this makes the simulationextremely slow; on our laptop computer, a simulation run takes 1 minute without this additionalexport versus 120 minutes with export. we do not recommend exporting these types ofadditional results unless it is extremely necessary for the purpose of analysis. results reported inarena's built-in reports are generally sufficient for the purpose of analysis.figure b.10:

conclusion.  keywords\\u2014hybrid cloud, cloud computing, supply chain organization, cyber security, warehouse, automation, and supplier relations i. introduction according to information technology consulting corporations, microsoft's azure in cloud computing arises as a rapid increase in technology that many organizations are ready to assume to progress the efficiency of the companies [1]. investment in current technologies, for instance, cloud figuring, is rapidly growing at eighteen percent annually. at the same time, it is estimated to reach at least eighty percent of information technology by 2025. the use of microsoft azure is evolving per year in various companies. the investigations indicate that seventy-two percent of the participating organizations had already substantially implemented cloud technologies, especially microsoft azure. at the same time, some organization is still piloting all project on their works and analyzing both benefits and challenges of the technology [2]. the application of microsoft azure in supply chain management and retail warehouse distribution have been performing in which it has led to a large-scale transformation in traditional warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management, leading such organizations to innovate more dynamic retail distribution.  the research indicated various activities that the microsoft azure providers incorporate, including forecasting, planning sourcing and procurement, spare parts maintenance, and logistics, considered the first move in the cloud [3]. involving microsoft azure's cloud-based technology in warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management has contributed many advantages such as simplified operations, capital investment, time visibility, and scalability. however, before applying veil computing technology in supply chain management and retail distribution, limitations and risks such as confidential material and weak data awareness should be considered. many companies are utilizing cloud computing from the private to the public stage, enabling an organization to benefit from the competitive advantage of implementing cloud interaction. ii. methodology this research depends on secondary, for instance, reference materials, research papers, and conference proceedings, such as all forms of reliable statistics that determine this paper's determination [4]. thus, this paper has an overview and a summary of the use of microsoft azure as cloud computing in supply chain organization and retail warehouse distribution and the relationship between the use of microsoft azure and supply chain performance. in addition to the case study, the researchers interviewed cloud providers on their views on supply chain international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248\\u20109738 , vol\\u20103, issue\\u20104 20  transparency and its related risk in cloud computing [5-7]. from the analysis of participants' responses to the case study and interviews, their collected some transparency structures that could be useful in comparing cloud providers based on the data they published on their websites. the results discussion, conclusions, and recommendation. a. cloud computing when mentioning cloud computing, it is essential to indicate both software that cloud benefactors can give to their customers and hardware. cloud computing is an information technology service model that can provide computing services either by hardware or software and deliver information on demand to customers independently [8]. customers can access cloud-based applications via web browsers, whereas data and software are kept in the servers' locations. cloud figuring can be characterized into four types: isolated cloud totaling, open cloud computing, hybrid cloud totaling, and community [9]. the advantage of public computing against supply chain management is that organizations are not concerned about system maintenance or construction.  fig 1: warehouse management system with cloud  public cloud computing in the distribution of retail warehouses is designed for open usage by the public. public cloud computing can be operated and managed by companies and several partners; public cloud exists outside of the locations of the cloud providers. using public cloud computing, users can achieve a cheaper setup application since third-party providers cover the cost [10]. while private cloud computing is on the premises of the cloud arrangement where operators of diverse business components retrieve it within the institute, the importance of using private cloud computing to develop privacy from the internal computing sources operating within the company [11]. therefore, the need for higher security levels and lower risk has been perfect since it limits the number of users. several customers have preferred private cloud computing over public cloud computing because of its flexibility and security.  hybrid cloud computing is the grouping of public cloud and isolated cloud. in a hybrid cloud, there is two different cloud structure, whereas the remaining exclusive units are combined by the consistent technology that permits application and data to be portable. in hybrid cloud computing, the organization can sustain its isolated cloud and scale out the public; if the local volume is well utilized or in-the-house arrangements cannot support the workload, then an external system can provide alternative support [12]. hybrid cloud figuring can stabilize the risks and benefits between public and private cloud computing and manage the cost of infrastructure in supply chain organizations and retail warehouse distribution. cloud computing is only designed for companies with common goals, such as security necessities and regulatory obedience [13]. communal cloud computing can be accomplished by more or a single party of the community or a combination of both. community cloud computing can be hosted either externally or internally.  retailers can use microsoft azure to accept or recover any file planned for distribution with various entities, such as forms, pictures, and videotape, among other organizer kinds, or usage in a cloud presentation. microsoft azure packing can even accommodate the categories of facts usually defined as big data, like underdone data from systematic tools or records from attendants [14]. even holdups from record attendants and other campaigns, as well as computer-generated challenging energies for extra to simulated apparatuses, can be positioned in splotch storing. enables improved provision of a devolved industry traversing numerous places can transfer international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248\\u20109738 , vol\\u20103, issue\\u20104 21  information technology economics from conservation to allow for novelty. a solitary combined suite, eliminating the necessity to mix different schemes, enables improved teamwork with dealers, consumers, and networks. the use of microsoft azure in warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management consists of three unlike prototypes, which include organization as a provision, software as an amenity, and stage as services in which each of sieving various requirements of the microsoft users. b. improved data security in the warehouse the retailers obtain a nonstop flow of clients each time, and statistics are produced continuously. cloud figuring is vibrant to accomplish such a massive volume of facts made by transactions, standard facts, and so on [10]. furthermore, such business-delicate information must be cautiously controlled. a critical reason for corporate disappointment is the cost of private corporate statistics, individually recognizable information via system penetration, outbreaks of the most mutual attacks on supercomputers and the system/attendant, and ransomware contaminating structures and negotiations statistics.information safety is a single significant issue to be talked about. some retailers uphold their transactions facts, account intelligence, and purchaser response, among others, on the resident attendants [15]. while it is suggested that keeping facts on the cloud helps protect the information through advanced firewalls, encryption, occasion classification, internal firewalls, and external security. c. improved buyer experience in the logistics world, the vendors only partially use the client and transaction information that they gather. the cloud amenities supplier uses dynamic computing capitals and arithmetical representations to examine facts [16]. with its massive file, vendors can influence the points from the linked strategies to explore the ordering conduct, styles, and connections with theproduct to advance a reasonable superiority in policymaking. utilizing client information analytics aimed at analytical acquisitions, retailers can forecast their clients' purchasing performance and what goods they purchase each time. if they buy reduced produces, what is the variety of the products they purchase? these figures are kept on the cloud, and by consuming analytics, merchants grow their promotion or selling approaches to appeal to additional consumers [17]. the practice of statistics analytics has increased, with the cloud being safe, dependable, and inexpensive for information storage and dispensation. infrastructure as a service administration through cloud computing presented essential changes in cooperative relations, beliefs, and message positions. the consequences presented extraordinary results for huge administrations using cloud figuring amid harmonious concerns and interpersonal results [18]. logistics directors from great establishments supposed that administrations utilizing cloud computing produced higher interpersonal results. infrastructure as a provision is a platform where businesses can display their products in the method of attendants, storing, universe, and hardware at remuneration per usage provision. these services are ideal the microsoft azure suppliers them in the paper of a virtual machine to raw storage or physical firewalls, networks, and load balances [19]. many users buy these models as outsourced services instead of software and networking equipment servers to monitor the organization. a perfect example is amazon cloud aws and microsoft azure. d. platform as a service microsoft azure provides a host for computing settings, typically operating system programming language and database, where the users deploy and develop the application. customers can lease virtual attendants to create and organize the current application. in some circumstances, the storage and figure properties are gauged routinely to acquire presentation requests. for instance, cloud customers do not have to distribute resources physically [20]. software as service(saas) mode cloud providers operate and install presentation software in the mist, and customers use the software on many customers' tools via the thin client interface. for instance, program interface and computing resources are accessed by various customers using one of the models. technology, cloud figuring is typical for allowing universal, practical, on-request system admission to a public pond of configurable adding international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248\\u20109738 , vol\\u20103, issue\\u20104 22  assets submissions that can be quickly provided and unconstrained through negligible administration energy or amenity supplier interface. prominently, it energetically poises to encounter the present request, whether the market outcomes from the performance of a supply-rigorous presentation by a sole operator or the unexpected arrival of numerous customers demanding entrance to a unified mutual source.  fig 2: software as a service  likewise, cloud assets can be free once request starts to reduce [21]. taking a cloud organization implies that researchers should not concern with having or acquisition of the abilities to shape, achieve, and uphold a central and climbable situation. in its place, they can depend on unceasing contact with a data epicenter acquired by a third party. instead of participating frankly to protect the essential hardware for an organization accomplished of supportive calculating science, investigators can, in its place, recompense for admission to the cloud totaling only as the necessity rises. microsoft azure's contact with massive ranges of achieved assets is an extra convincing cloud feature for scholars [22]. cloud computing stages uphold the organization besides amenities on which claims are operated, such as functioning schemes and record facilities. since all hardware is inattentive by the cloud podium, there is no addiction to any exact portion of hardware. so, sellers can relate covers and improve workings without unfavorably affecting management. iii. cloud-influence in supply chain activities the presentation of the microsoft azure notion in supply sequence organization and retail warehouse distribution generates and innovates new fields that can be linked to two parties by delivering related information and cloud facilities. planning and forecasting. microsoft azure platforms are helping an organization to advance their services by organizing the sequence associates. such as supplier retailers and distributors, who play a vital role in demand forecasting. microsoft azure gathers sales through the internet, performs simple analytics, and executes an accurate statistical demand forecast to various supply participants. the gathering of information through the internet leads to a significant decrease in the bullwhip effect in the supply chain [23], which contributes to the distortion of critical information in various stages of supply chain management. therefore, enabling all the partners involved in supply to be conscious of the actual claim instability so that they can manage the situation. microsoft azure provides a solution for the order planning and demand combine and prediction implementation submissions to one solitary multi-party podium. the customer makes an order; supplies send the information to the public cloud making the data available simultaneously to all supply chains.  a. sourcing and procurement  sourcing includes receipt, attainment, and examination of received resources, identifying the obtaining process, and choosing suitable dealers. in this section, microsoft, the azure platform, can operate a database with various suppliers' data. microsoft provides a significant boost for companies dealing with many supply materials. organizations can choose their supplies depending on the appropriate materials provided according to time limits and specifications [24]. cloud computing enables stores and organizations to develop contracts, mutually enlightening contract management. b. logistics microsoft azure is useful for inventory, transportation, and warehouse management. the use of microsoft azure for logistics tracking various supply sequence associates. procedures such as scheduling fleet management, command international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248\\u20109738 , vol\\u20103, issue\\u20104 23  handling, conveyance course preparation, and worldwide compliance can be transferred to a cloud computing base[25]. a sole integrated cloud platform has more advantages to the transport sector because it limits pipeline inventory and the hand logistics sector [26]. cloud services are essential for supply companies for itineraries. cloud computing provides solutions to warehousing management due to many different customers at the same tie in one system.  c. service and utility management reverse logistics should be final in supply chain management; reverse logistics should be considered since it increases profits.   microsoft azure as cloud computing provides an opportunity for organizations to integrate advancing logistics (see fig 3) through converse logistics in the warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management [27]. for instance, radio occurrence identification is an intelligence knowledge container used to pathway inventory location and later transmit information to the cloud application. moreover, the inventory route can be observable to all supply chain management, from customers to manufacturers and vice versa. the returns processing, warranty proof, spare parts record, and technician report are the only progressions presented efficiently in a sole cloud-based stage.   fig 3: manufacturing automation flow  many organizations reflect the manufacturing technique as their extensive supply chain stage. cloud computing may be proven unsuitable for manufacturing because of its complex essential procedure that requires a high level of degree customization that the cloud-based cannot offer [28]. iv. cloud computing in third-party logistics services after debating primarily about the potential for cloud-computing suggestions in supply chain organization and retail warehouse distribution, precisely the issues that technology contributes to companies. the reflectiveness of inventory and shipments either inside the company s boundaries among the source chain and retail warehouse stakeholders[29]. cloud multiplying as a public, hybrid, or private cloud assembly can provide internal or external reflectiveness, which enhances with consequences and benefits as discussed below (fig 4).   fig 4: extended supply chain in the cloud era[29]  v. cloud multiplying on scm and warehouse retail distribution changing an ancient source chain in an organization should determine the mechanical needs for shifting the source chain to the cloud and transforming the supply chain to microsoft azure, as cloud computing can be implemented by employing a cloud life cycle, a development lifecycle with numerous steps that make it possible for the transformation process to be evaluated and developed regularly. nevertheless, before the transformational process, organizations should consider all the functional aspects that can make them create an overview of microsoft azure's execution in the supply chain management process[30]. queries about the modifications, the advantages, and the challenges that are likely to be encountered when using microsoft azure should be considered before an organization takes any vital decision when moving to cloud computing. the subtopics below address the positive impacts of microsoft azure as cloud computing and the challenges likely to be international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248\\u20109738 , vol\\u20103, issue\\u20104 24  encountered when employing cloud-based technologies.further, the positive aspects of cloud adaption are defined below.  a. cost efficiency microsoft azure as a cloud computing system can be employed effectively because it has numerous financial advantages for organizations using the technology. cloud facilities do not need any venture for software or device control possession. thus, microsoft azure is more beneficial than regular in-house enterprise resource planning structures provided by public clouds[31]. as a result, supply chain management capital cost can be shifted to operational expenditure, improving organizational cash flow. thus, organizations must only pay activation and usage fees to install microsoft azure systems. this ensures that a company will save more resources by minimizing maintenance costs and ensuring minimal upgrade costs.   b. simplification.  microsoft azure, as a cloud computing system, simplifies the organization. the system ensures that each part of the supply series is easily accessible via the same podium[32]. moreover, the system eliminates compatibility issues to simplify the connection process and enhance information sharing among participants in a specific supply chain. thus, the organization benefits from a collaborative community that improves security by allowing participants to set security[33]. the system minimizes the response time when making decisions between two or more participants. cloud-founded services provide information regulation via one centralized storage structure to ensure a smooth flow of information in the supply chain.  c. flexibility  the cloud computing system provides flexibility from demand projection to transportation or warehouse management. the demand prediction process, warehouse, and transport management involve numerous applications in the supply chain, which can be boosted in one cloud-founded platform. furthermore, microsoft azure ensures that participants can access such a stage from various organizational environments through a standard device despite the different geographical locations[34]. management of microsoft azure is location-independent; hence can be accessed from other geographical areas. the extensive network availability alerts the entire supply chain, making the company swiftly enter a fresh market with new products and services.  d. visibility implementing microsoft azure in an organization offers timely linking with numerous supply chain partners. thus, an organization can monitor the supply chain occurrences when they occur and deal with possible issues or deviations from the main goals [35]. visibility is critical because it ensures that organizations can organize their activities and oversee various customers while providing the customer network has a clear view of the entire supply chain process. the organization also benefits from real-time inventory visibility to improve logistic trailing [36]. microsoft azure acts as a simulated warehouse for specific goods, such as those in the pipeline, enabling the firm to meet strategic order decisions. moreover, it becomes easy for the organization to reroute the inventory as guided by the actual product location. vi. riskand limitations microsoft azure, being a cloud-based technology, faces the problem of information safety and confidentiality. data in the cloud should only be retrieved by accredited bodies such as trusted supply chain participants [37]. nevertheless, cloud figuring structures as software items cannot continuously be responsible for discretion and privacy due to the rise in cyber security issues such as hacking[38]. moreover, the advanced modern technology makes it possible for competitors to access crucial data from other organizations, threatening the entire supply chain process. a. outdated mindset information and data distribution with public entities results in an immediate change in the ancient methods of thinking and working, which is vital in an organization's culture. research shows that most organizations must disclose information concerning their production international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248\\u20109738 , vol\\u20103, issue\\u20104 25  procedures or supply chain processes[39]. if competitors access such information, the organization can lose its competitive advantage. implementing microsoft azure in supply chain management implies that a new change is introduced in the organization, which modifies the entire supply chain process[40]. therefore, the organization must train its employees about the new technology to ensure a successful transition process. thus, more adequate resources are needed to speed up the transition process.  b. flexible availability the users of microsoft azure as a cloud computing technology raises issues about the impacts of a possible crash down due to the user system's workload, which will interfere with the entire supply chain process. such cases can be fatal to the organization resulting in a massive loss due to any delays caused by the malfunction[41, 42]. additionally, the system can be negatively affected by poor network connectivity in different geographical locations leading to inconveniences in the supply chain process. c. customization free solutioning cloud computing technology cannot be easily customized according to the needs of the supply chain process since it usually provides a standardized service. therefore, it may be difficult for the organization to solve specific supply chain errors [43]. for instance, since the production process is a composite primary process in the supply chain process with numerous customized methods depending on the product type, there should be a high level of cloud computing customization to make the process effective[44]. thus, the absence of specialization lowers the market response and can negatively affect the company's competitive advantage. vii. cloud types a. private cloud the private cloud provides computing resources distributed among various business units controlled by a single infrastructure. introducing fedex in private companies lets an organization emphasize client connection and get one border for many transaction procedures [45]. before the introduction of private cloud technology, companies encountered many difficulties regarding massive collections of information, which requires a lot of computing control to analyze. however, when cloud computing was deployed, it reduced time wastage by about sixty percent and provided a parallel execution of batch processes. fedex controls the company's activities all over the sphere by enabling global demand to deliver position and worldwide list visibility [46]. the hybrid cloud in this sector allows for the company's sales team an exclusive feature of a mobile solution that increases the effectiveness and improves the service of the company and the customer.  b. public cloud more than the private cloud is needed to accommodate many customers and partners; this problem encourages the introduction of the public cloud. concerning supply chain tracking, some traditional organizations use phone calls and emails to collect the required data, which does not offer timely visibility. it suffers a big blow connecting all stakeholders (banerjee, 2018). contrary to the introduction of cloud-based public platforms contributes to capable connection to all customers and supply chains (khodyakov et al.,.2018). shifting to the free cloud suggests crucial monetary welfare for companies since it reduces the cost due to the nonexistence of possession cost of services providers. the most significant advantage of a public cloud platform is that its delivered information on the timely fulfillment of orders to customers and the minimum price. a natural disaster can reduce the rate of transportation schedules for many companies; therefore, cloud technology provides a solution to such obstacles [46, 47]. shifting companies to the public cloud offer logistics management services to their customers, subsidiaries, and distributors. cloud figuring allows minor companies to portion the same amenities as more prominent o organizations. for instance, the paybacks of flexibly interrelating and achieving procedures external to the association reduce the cost of ownership of supply series partnerships. cloud computing needs the arbitrating support of supply sequence addition to achieve predictable achievement. nevertheless, there is no final sign that cloud figuring has an inspiring result on either supply chain incorporation or operating presentation [48]. a significant positive connection was established international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248\\u20109738 , vol\\u20103, issue\\u20104 26  between supply sequence addition and functioning presentation in all symbols used. viii. recommendations microsoft azure makes warehouse and supply chain management greener and neater[49].cloud computing can be practical in supply chain organizations and retail distribution to facilitate stakeholder collaboration. forecasting on the cloud limits distortion of the demand of the actual customers. cloud computing is a relatively vast supply chain management. many microsoft azure implementations in warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management have yet to be fully discovered. business email compromises were the second most shared form of social engineering. the mainstream of social business incidents was found externally. suppliers are subjugating older strengths that have yet to be patched. the organization offers real-time visibility via shipment across the supply chain management and retail warehouse distribution. ix. conclusions adopting enabling technology, supply chain management, and retail warehouse distribution should deploy a strong network that can improve the efficiency of the operation. moreover, providing automated pick lists with coordinated devices and mobile to help reduce waste and eliminate mistakes. the organization of the workstation increases productivity since the workers have everything in one place. workstations should be deployed all techniques and designs to reduce errors, keep carriers at bay, and improve safety. supply chain management and retail warehouse distribution should optimize labor efficiency to generate effective picking plans and provide a high-volume ratio for the organization. the companies should streamline operations. to optimize and maximize all available space, companies should include taller storage units that can accommodate many goods and use standardized bins to improve the neatness and orderly of the shelves. the organization should adopt lean inventory to increase stock safety and allow suppliers to use larger quantities more often.  acknowledgment we want to thank our mentor, dr. azad ali, for giving us opportunities and providing us the opportunity to perform this research on different cloud platforms and applicability on the supply chain and keeping our requestto review this.  reference [1]

 keywords \\u2013 green supply chain management (gscm), green logistics, food retail, waste management.    i. introduction  the overall growing concern over environmental issues had further emphasized on the importance of incorporating green and sustainable practice in the supply chain management. having this new concept, gscm encourages production of more green products alongside improving the integration of suppliers with environmental issues [2, 3]. over the years, the study of gscm had often explored in the industrial sector and hardly in other sectors such as the food retail industry. in recent years, researchers had started to focus on adopting green and environment friendly concepts in the service industry rather than manufacturing industry [4]. therefore, research relating to gscm, and food retail industry began to surface. earlier research highlighted that there is growing interest on the relation between gscm and food retail industry because food and beverage industry act as a primary industry that is most suitable to mitigate environmental impacts [5].    ii. literature review  the main purpose of conducting this literature studies is to examine the important observed research to identify various aspects of green supply chain management. secondly, the studies also aim to determine the practices and methods adopted by manufactures and good retail sectors. retailers are responsible for all supply chain processes [6]. the link between in-store activities and logistics had been identified by [7] as a major aspect to research on retailing. this finding was later affirmed by [8] through a list of sustainable retailing measures. it was then detected that the measures focus on energy, water, and waste management. some retailers do not pay serious attention on the importance of water and energy management and the impact to the environment. however, water management is important in food retail stores especially in the areas where hygiene standards are prioritized. besides water, energy management is also one of the important in-store processes that associates with keeping the environment green. in food retail industries, energy management play an important role when it comes to temperature regulating for food products such as chilled and frozen food. another study [9] had further confirmed that the key drivers of carbon dioxide gas emission in malaysia are economic growth and energy consumption [9]. as the industrial sector contributes to the malaysia's economic growth, research suggested that it was not likely to reduce energy consumption as doing so may affect the economic growth to dwindle as well. the researchers suggested that energy saving methods should be emphasize and policy makers could look on other alternatives such as investing in exploratory of the renewable energy sources [9].   in malaysia, according to solid waste and public cleansing management corporation), there are approximately 16,650 tons of food waste dumped daily in landfills. in fact, the amount of food waste tends to increase by 15-20% more especially during festive seasons [10]. this food waste disposal method is beginning to raise concern of the authorities because the improper food waste management will create negative impact to the environment as greenhouse gas emission is increased due to high amount of methane and carbon dioxide produced because of natural decomposition process [11]. to tackle the issue of excess food waste, the standard and industrial research institute of malaysia (sirim) had come up with some projects with the effort of converting these food waste to generate sources of energy. besides, food waste could also be transformed into useful organic fertilizer to combat food waste issue. however, efforts from the government and ngos will not be enough. the society should play their part and be aware of the importance of food waste management for the betterment of the environment and future generations [12].    proceeding book of the 6th icmem 2021, 11-13 august 2021, bandung, indonesia isbn: 978-623-92201-2-9   \\u00a9 2021  the 6th international conference on management in emerging markets (icmem 2021)  a. green supply chain management (gscm) the public has become more aware about environmental issues happening worldwide in recent years and have directed the focus onto gscm by integrating green concepts and practices into the traditional supply chain management. the main reason that drives the greening of supply chain in organisations is to address the environmental burden caused by the industry and its operations [13]. for efforts of greening the supply chain to be effective, it also depends greatly on the organization nature. there are various green supply chain practices that were identified and followed in practice in the manufacturing industries. this study intends to focus more on gscm practice in terms of cooperation with customers, green purchasing and eco design.  customer cooperation in supply chain is the extent where two parties collaborate with a mutual goal to achieve sustainable outcomes [14]. in fact, customer pressure would exist within this collaboration and play a role in influencing the organisation in adopting gscm [15]. developing a close cooperation with customers is encouraged as this collaboration could enhance and strengthen green innovations in supply chains. this approach would create a win-win opportunity to meet customer demand and improve sustainability effectively. besides that, new green innovations would surely assist firms to stay competitive in the market among their competitors [16]. the cooperation with customers would also be able to contribute positively to the food retail industry as interactions with customer is crucial in the aspect of setting environment goals and plan together with efforts of reducing environmental impact. according to studies [17], there will be a direct involvement of organisation with its customers for environmental collaboration and this will bring about joint development of environmental solutions.  green purchasing is one of the preliminary steps in addressing global environmental concern because the basics of purchasing is about acquiring the correct materials in the correct quantity or quality and at the correct time and place [18]. more specifically, green purchasing is simply acquiring environment-friendly or green products or services [19].  nowadays, green purchasing appears to be an important component of environmental and supply chain strategies. due to consumers' rising concerns over the environment, purchasing companies had stressed on the role of purchasing functions in improving the environmental performance by integrating environmental aspects into business and organisational dimensions in making purchasing decisions. to ensure that purchases are green and benefits the environment, the practice of green purchasing is already introduced and implemented in the industries. green purchasing creates awareness in purchasing activities by considering waste reduction and at the same time encouraging the effort of recycling and reusing certain materials [20]. the green products approach is still relatively new in malaysia [21]. there is limited research available for reference which relates to green consumer products. therefore, it is worthwhile exploring green purchasing especially in food retail industry, in terms of waste reduction and purchasing of eco-friendly machineries and materials for food production processes with the aim to control the number of toxic gases being released into the environment.   the eco concept in manufacturing a product considers the aim to reduce a product's environmental effects throughout the entire life cycle [21]. it is close to impossible to design a product which does not have any impact at all to the environment, but at least, with this strategy, the eco-design approach would contribute to achieving a more sustainable future [13]. in recent years, companies are already seriously looking into producing eco-designed products to maintain competitiveness in the market, based on consumers' changing perceptions, needs and preferences. furthermore, the concept of eco-design also serves as a great opportunity for companies to achieve their goal of replacing harmful and hazardous materials used with materials that are more environment friendly. in the food retail industry, the gscm eco design practice plays an important role especially in the production of eco products or packaging which have the reusable and recyclable attributes. in a review [18], researchers highlighted that the adoption of eco-design practice had significantly reduced the negative impact on the environment thus improving the company's ability to contribute towards sustainability. engaging suppliers in collaborative programs on eco products designing can sometimes lead to introduction of new innovative ideas pertaining to environmental technologies and materials.   b. performance outcomes in the present, the attention is now churned towards balancing between business and environmental challenges and requirements. there has been on-going research that discover and explore the impact of gscm on performance outcomes which interlinks environment and economic performances [22, 20]. however, the interlink study of gscm on environment together with social performances are rarely found in the industries. therefore, this study will focus on discovering the impact of gscm on both environment and social performances in food retail industry.  environment performance can be evaluated based on a company's resources consumed, regulation compliance level, processes, products, and services towards the environment [23]. the environmental performance can be measured in terms of reduction of poisonous gas emission, solid wastes and hazardous material consumptions created by activities in the supply chain network. as there seem to be a significant connection between environmental performance with supply chain management. the implementation of gscm will improve the environmental performance for both the firm itself and to the suppliers or customers that conform to proceeding book of the 6th icmem 2021, 11-13 august 2021, bandung, indonesia isbn: 978-623-92201-2-9   \\u00a9 2021  the 6th international conference on management in emerging markets (icmem 2021)  environmental regulations [24]. as there is demand for environmental performance, firms had to evaluate their performances by taking the initiative to improve on their capabilities in this aspect. other studies mentioned that there could be positive effects on environmental performance should companies focus more on both corporate environmental management and gscm [23]. to enhance environmental performance, [25] suggested that companies should engage in environmental collaborations and monitoring with the suppliers and customers at the supply chain level. therefore, this study investigates whether there will be a similar positive impact of gscm on environmental performance specific to food retail industry.  social performance in general can be perceived as a measure of social related issues that brings about the attention of the society [26]. there are various social related concerns that a firm should consider along with the implementation of gscm practices. according to [27], even though social performance is recognised for its importance, however, studies on this aspect is rarely found with the reason being that it can be quite a challenge to measure this performance based on social indicators. social issues found in supply chain was defined by [28] as the effect of product or process-related aspects of operation on human safety, welfare, and community development. as there could be other metrics of measures possibly available for evaluating social performance, the metrics could be identified and selected by different dimensions [29]. due to the limited number of studies available for reference, the impact of gscm on social performance is yet to be assessed in this study that focus on food retail industry and the findings will be reported accordingly.  iii. proposed research framework  for many years, there are many studies carried out that highlights the importance of the relationships among experiences, the green supply chain management practices, and firm's performances [30, 31]. only a few similar works were done in the context of food retail industry [20, 32]. however, detailed analysis was carried out on different sets of relationship between the individual antecedents with individual gscm practice and, individual gscm practice with individual variables of performance outcomes. this research studies provide the importance of various attributes of green supply chain management practices and the performance variables. hence, the study intends to contribute to a continuation of the previous research results and step up to the next level by identifying and verifying the relationship and impact of gscm on other performance outcomes, in this case is environmental and social performances. the core of this study can be represented with a simple conceptual framework to connect the variables of interest. in this case, the backgrounds here are the in-store logistics referring to environmental and waste management. these two backgrounds encourage further implementation of gscm practices which are cooperation with customers, green purchasing and eco-design that forms the central structure of the framework. the final part of the study will relate to the performance outcomes, environmental and social performance. there are multiple individual relationships to be investigated and each one is represented as an individual hypothesis. the in-store logistic measures are assumed to directly drive the practice of gscm thus forming the hypothesis to be explore in future research. the conceptual framework summarised by the individual relationships of study indicated by the arrows connecting the variables.   fig. 1.  research conceptual framework  \\uf0a7 h1a \\u2013 water and energy management positively affects cooperation of customers. \\uf0a7 h1b \\u2013 water and energy management

\\uf0a7 h2b \\u2013 waste management positively affects green purchasing. \\uf0a7 h2c \\u2013 waste management positively affects eco-design.    the above connection formed between in-store logistics and gscm practices are further extended to link the relationship with the environmental and social performance of the firm. it is believed that the cooperation of customers, green purchasing and eco-design should lead to improving the environmental and social performances. thus, the formulation of the remaining hypotheses as:  \\uf0a7 h3a \\u2013 cooperation with customers positively affects the environmental performance. \\uf0a7 h3b \\u2013 cooperation with customers positively affects the social performance. \\uf0a7 h4a \\u2013 green purchasing positively affects the environmental performance. \\uf0a7 h4b \\u2013 green purchasing positively affects the social performance. proceeding book of the 6th icmem 2021, 11-13 august 2021, bandung, indonesia isbn: 978-623-92201-2-9

retail industry, a preliminary conclusion can be drawn that even though gscm is widely known and implemented in companies, it could rarely be taken for the food retail industry. the in-store logistics that are potential impacts on gscm practices were identified and justified the importance of implementing gscm practices in business and organisational operations. however, there are various gscm practices that a company can adopt depending on their organizational needs, business functions and nature. in this study, three gscm practices such as cooperation with customers, green purchasing and eco-design are chosen as the focus due to these variables are important components to be concerned of in the company when incorporating green concept in the organisation. past research revealed that gscm practices tend to affect environmental performance in the industries. however, limited evidence was found relating to social performance as not many studies were done in the aspect. therefore, in food retail industry, the findings obtained at the end of this study shall be able to provide a better picture whether gscm practices are able to contribute on improving company's performance outcomes.  this research focuses on food retail industries in malaysia. however, the area of study in malaysia itself is too wide. being a country comprising of 14 states, the area of study for this research has been narrowed down and penang is selected as the prime location for data collection. penang is well-known for being the food capital of malaysia, thus food retail industry tends to occupy a relatively big market. in fact, penang was also previously reported as one of the top three states with the highest retail sub-sector occupancy. there are several studies that explored the concepts of gscm, including its implications and applications. in malaysia, studies related to gscm in food retail industry is indeed very rare. this research, in trying to establish the association between green in-store logistics and food retail industry performance outcome due to the implementation of green supply chain management, produces the results that should contribute to enhancing the management focus on adopting green concepts and cultures in supply chain management of food retail industry. the study aimed to identify various aspects of green supply chain management practices through comprehensive review of literature based on the outcomes of various studies carried out within the context of food retail and food manufacturing environments. through our study it was noted that many researchers have proposed different framework based on the specific criteria and attributes within their context, and one which can be taken as the basis of future work for our research studies. one of the other aspects for future research could also examine the managerial and strategic implications on the adoption of gscm practices within food retail sector. it should aim to inform and provide key decision makers, including management on any patters of observations and practices to be adopted by retailers. businesses could be able to explore any drivers and barriers towards adoption of these methods and frameworks to enable them towards their future retail practices and user experiences towards green practices. finally, like any research or conceptual studies, our study also has few limitations. although, our study adopted a systematic approach towards researching the existing knowledge and articles, the authors do envisage some gaps that could be further explored by future research studies. for example, a social dimension study on the impact and behaviours of individuals and users from different cultural, social and usage backgrounds can be explored in future. similarly, demographic, and behavioral studies may also be explored as a dimension in the future. future researchers and studies are encouraged to focus on both conceptual and empirical studies to further examine and evaluate the concepts of green supply chain management practices.  references  [1] q. zhu, j. sarkis, k. h. lai, \\\"green supply chain management innovation diffusion and its

supply chain management technology  1 chapter 1 \\u2013 introduction  supply chain management is a multiple level tool of understanding which provides a retailer the opportunity to manage all costs associated with raw material sourcing, manufacturing, handling, storing, and redistribution of product.  supply chain management plays an integral part in improving the effectiveness which organizations manufacture and deliver products to business partners and consumers.  the ultimate goal of effective supply chain management is to provide the consumer with the product that they want, when they want it, and at a competitive delivered price.    there are numerous tools and processes utilized by retailers in supply chain management including universal product code (upc), vendor managed inventory (vmi), and handheld devices (smart handheld).    the most common tool of a replenishment system is the universal product code or upc.  upc provides a standardized method for identifying products and product description.  they allow retailers to keep track of products that the retailer receives and sells.  upc helps improve on-hand quantities and track products moving in and out of the store.   many retailers have also utilized additional inventory mechanisms, including vendor managed inventory, or vmi.  vmi is the process where the vendor manages the inventory and replenishment of the retailer's inventory.  vmi was designed to improve the product flow between the vendor and retailer.  some retailers also incorporate a handheld device, these are portable computers and order transmission devices.  handheld devices allow stores to manually update inventory levels and order product.   effective supply chain management technology  2 recently, more advanced technology has emerged in the consumer packaged goods industry. an example of this is radio-frequency identification (rfid), which allows a product to be tracked by radio frequency.  starting in june 2003, the wal-mart company requested that its top 100 suppliers place rfid tags on pallets and cases that were shipped to stores in dallas, texas.  many retailers such as target, best buy, and albertson's followed suit, and many manufacturers began to implement the technology within their products (read, 2004). rfid technology has the potential to revolutionize the consumer product industry, but also contains monumental obstacles that need to be overcome to realize its full potential.  while rfid promises new and efficient ways to distribute and control products within the consumer packaged goods (cpg) industry, there remain a number of questions that must be resolved before the technology is completely adopted by the industry.  rfid must present an accepted roi formula that proves that it is accepted by all levels in the supply chain.  roi formulas vary by company, but normal business practices call for any capital expenditures to either maintain or improve the company's return on investment goals.  simply stated, corporations are keenly aware of how wall street evaluates their expenditures for any asset, including technology.  usually the higher and faster the return on investment equates to higher stock ratings and the resulting higher stock valuation.  privately held companies might be judged to be worth more in the event they were to be sold.  the issues with rfid are further complicated by the return rate which can vary by market segment; a manufactures roi requirement may be different than a distributors or retailer due to industry standards and competition.  \\\"best of class\\\" always tends to set hurdle rates for each segment.  additionally, all levels effective supply chain management technology  3 must decide upon a common and efficient hardware configuration.   the data that is collected and assigned to products must also be managed and defined.  current legacy systems must also be taken into account and the process of implementing the new technology must be defined in a consistent framework.  finally, rfid must create standards and concepts that can be applied throughout the business world including international networks and supply chains (poirier, 2006). this paper will look at the current state of rfid technology in the consumer packaged goods industry.  it will look the benefits and barriers to implementing the technology across the industry.  the paper will conduct a study that will look at a major distributor in the consumer packaged goods industry, the mclane company.  the current distribution model and technology used by the organization will be discussed and analyzed.  fill rates and replenish processes using barcode technology will be discussed to determine if a new technology such as rfid tags would improve fill rates, location, tracking, and efficiency. the study will provide the industry insight into the benefits and obstacles into implementing rfid across a large scale.  listed below are the questions this thesis will address.  research questions \\uf0b7 what is the current distribution model used by the mclane company? \\uf0b7 what method is currently implemented for product and item location? \\uf0b7 what are the results and fill rates of using a vendor managed inventory vmi system? \\uf0b7 what is current process for replenishment to stores?

chain management (scm) has been studied for decades.  moving products effectively from production to the end user has been studied and analyzed by manufactures, distributors and retailers, all attempting to improve the process.  the term \\\"supply chain management\\\", became popular in the late 1980's within the business world.  is defined as \\\"the systemic, strategic coordination of the traditional business functions and the tactics across these business functions within a particular company and across businesses within the supply chain, for the purposes of improving the long-term performance of the individual companies and the supply chain as a whole\\\" (metzer, 2001).   the supply chain is operated by a number of components and organizations.  each component is responsible for different functions, with the end goal of delivering a final product to the consumer effectively and at a low cost.  the companies that participate in the supply chain include producers, distributors, retailers, and the consumer.  producers are typically the manufactures of a product.  they make a product out of raw materials and package the product for consumption.  distributors are organizations that are the middleman between the manufacturer and retailer.  a distributor will receive and store products from a large number of manufacturers and will deliver or replenish the product to retailers depending on the retailers need.  retailers sell products directly to consumers.  retailers will advertise products and promotions to attract consumers to their stores.  consumers are the typically the end user of the product (hugos, 2006). there are a number of factors that drive the supply chain.  these include production, location, inventory, transportation, and information.  production includes the effective supply chain management technology  6 actual manufacturing of a product, quantity produced, and balancing the production capabilities while still maintaining quality. inventory management focuses on two important aspects, customer service and cost control.  inventory management helps decide how much inventory should be stocked during every stage of the supply chain.  inventory can be costly to hold, but must also be readily available, therefore a balance of levels must be made to ensure the most optimum level.  location in supply chain management determines the location of production and inventory.  organizations must ensure that the location of the facilities provide efficient transportation for delivery to retailers and consumers.  transportation involves what method is utilized to move the product through the supply chain (truck, train, aircraft, etc.).  information is another important aspect of supply chain management.  data must be collected and shared to ensure proper management and logistics (hugos, 2006). in order for supply chain management to work effectively, information must be gathered and stored throughout the management chain lifecycle.  when large amounts of products are produced and distributed throughout the supply chain, it is essential that these products can be identified effectively and efficiently.   in order to manage and maintain information and data, products are provided with an identification number or product identification code.  this code can identify a product quickly and efficiently and allows organizations to collect and share data (hugos, 2006). for the past fifteen years the most popular product tracking standard has been the universal product code or upc.  the first bar code was introduced in 1952, by joseph woodland and bernard silver.  the bar code was not used commercially until 1966.  starting in 1970 the first industry standard was introduced. it was called the universal effective supply chain management technology  7 grocery product identification code or ugpic.  three years later, the ugpic became what is now known as upc.  the first product to be used at a retail store occurred on june, 26, 1974, when a 10-pack of wrigley juicy fruit gum was scanned using a hand held scanner at marsch supermarket in troy, ohio.  since its original scanning in 1974 upc bar codes have been used to scan billions of products at retail stores (albert, 2007). the introduction of upc in the retail industry quickly transformed the way the cpg and grocery industry managed their business.  standards were created in upc barcodes and the system grew into a global system called the gs1 system.  the gs1 system is used by millions of companies in over 140 countries (barcodes, 2010). upc product codes are created by a not-for-profit company called uniform code council, or ucc.  the organization develops worldwide standards for identification codes and electronic commerce.  a upc barcode symbol includes a black and white bar code consisting of vertical black bars and white spaces in-between.  in addition to the black and white bar code, numbers are located at the bottom of each bar code symbol.  the distance between the vertical bars and the thickness of the black vertical bars contains the numbers in the barcode.  each barcode contains two black bars that identify the beginning and the end of the bar code (barcodes, 2010). when an organization requests a product to be entered in the upc system, the ucc will issue the manufacturer a specific identification number.  the gs1 company prefix is a unique code that contains a numerical sequence of anywhere from seven to eleven numerical digits which then are licensed to the manufacturer for a single item.  a legal entity gln is also assigned to the manufacturer that identifies legal descriptions and functions (uniform code council, 2010). effective supply chain management technology  8 the use of upc codes actually began in the early 1970's as a technological solution for large supermarkets trying to price goods. supermarkets were spending millions of labor dollars annually, paying workers to work nights affixing adhesive type labels to every \\\"store keeping unit\\\" or\\\" sku\\\" which they stocked. items that were refrigerated or frozen posed special problems for adhesive labels.  night labor was paid a premium shift differential and there was also a higher percentage of employee turnover; thereby increasing hiring and training costs.  it was made even more difficult, as the pricing of many goods are driven by the constantly changing commodity markets, and also other factors such as; freight costs, labor strikes, weather, manufacturing promotional activity, and competition supermarket profits depend on their ability to quickly raise prices on items that have gone up, thereby creating inventory profit gains. the reverse situation when prices fall also creates the need to maintain competitive pricing to protect market share.  pricing integrity is an important factor for customer retention. sale or promo items also drive price change needs. wednesday became the main newspaper advertising day for supermarkets to run their weekly specials, so all promo items had to be marked down on tuesday night. situations arose where the same product in the same bin had more than one price, or there were numerous incidents where the new price label did not quite cover the old price, triggering the infamous public announcement, \\\"price check in aisle 3 please\\\"(grogman, 2009).  supermarkets liked the premise that a unique numerical barcode would be made for every item produced and easily printed on the existing label or exterior packaging.  the upc process, although tedious in start up, quickly gained a loyal following because of the high return on the investment.  like any major technological change it created new effective supply chain management technology  9 challenges, the scanners were expensive and worked well when the upc code was easily displayed, but some items with reflective qualities such as water or clear juices reflected back the scan resulting in a \\\"no read\\\" and slowed the checkers. other times the scan bar was unable to read anything, as the enclosed glass screen was dirty, because of wet produce or leaking containers.  training techniques for check-out personal had to be included in the program. other issues that challenged the program were items made overseas that were not participating in the upc program, these vendor partners had to adhere to the standards or be culled from the sku mix.  there were also items that had the upc code but inside the carton there was more than one saleable unit. many times these individual items did not have a upc code, so someone buying one snicker bar, might inadvertently, pay for a box of 36.  these situations also led to overstock issues when supermarkets started using upc codes for replenishment, as sometimes there was confusion between eaches, boxes, and cases (grogman, 2009). the success of upc technology also accelerated the acceptance of the vmi process which was mentioned earlier.  there had been a huge increase in the number of products that were manufactured by one corporation, as well, as high volume sku's, which represented high percentages of daily sales. proctor and gamble, as an example, supplies thousands of items in many categories to a supermarket. it has products in almost every aisle and might control 15% to 20% of the total items stocked.  this type of mega-penetration leads to the mutual need of being \\\"in-stock\\\" and also being on the same page when it comes to marketing and advertising. vmi insures that a supermarket chain will have the information to promote certain items at the same time the manufacturer is using a variety of media events to create demand. the price that is charged is always, by effective supply chain management technology  10 law, determined by the retailer. the supermarket or big box store must have a firm written agreement in place which spells out measurable parameters that must be adhered to. main elements include; dollar inventory levels by day, week, and month, and cover holiday and seasonal items. inventory goals must also be negotiated to maximize inventory turn to free up capital from slow moving inventory. the manufacturer also benefits by manufacturing on a \\\"just in time\\\" atmosphere which \\\"frees up\\\" its capital as well, and allows it to operate more efficiently. shipping parameters must be decided to maximize both parties' logistical needs and sometimes enables a retailer to fine or charge back a vendor for failing to perform. finally there needs to be a written description of how and when \\\"on-going dialogue\\\" is to take place. a manufacturer always wants more shelf space and more of its sku's displayed, a retailer wants to stock what consumers want and also what produces the largest profit. vmi has evolved into a basic tenant of successful \\\"major retail players\\\" (grogman, 2009). while upc has been used in the majority of cpg supply chain management product coding, a new technology called radio frequency identification or rfid has recently began to gain momentum.  the beginnings of rfid can be traced back to world war ii.  the united kingdom applied rfid type devices to identify airplanes returning from a mission.  previously, radar could only detect incoming aircraft, but not the country of origin.  the application for using the technology began advancing in other industries about 30 years later.  the supply chain has been a particularly strong market for rfid and its technology.  in 1974, a group of european organizations came together to develop a standard number system similar to the upc standards that were established in the united states.  the resulting organization became known as european article numbering effective supply chain management technology  11 international or ean.   in 1999, steps were taken to form a global network that would standardize rfid in the supply chain.  the ucc and procter and gamble began funding the auto-id center, which is based at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge massachusetts.  the major goal of the auto id center was to create inexpensive rfid tags that could be used in consumer goods.    the tags would allow a network to collect and share information about products that had a rfid chip installed.  the auto-id center plans to create a network that would become \\\"an internet of things\\\": and allow the ability to share and locate items throughout the network.  the auto-id center is comprised of 100 global companies and seven universities from around the world.  the center focuses on creating cost efficient standards, and future proofing the epc network infrastructure. this will allow the industry to grow and support future applications and advancements in technology (poirier & mccollum, 2006). the interest in rfid continued to develop in the cpg industry, wal-mart in 2003 announced new mandates for rfid implementations.  wal-mart required that its top 100 suppliers must apply rfid labels to all of its shipments.  early adopters of rfid found it difficult to implement the system in their current legacy and supply chain management systems.  many manufacturers implemented manual processes which made it difficult to realize a fair return on investment (duvall, 2007). rfid operations and functions rfid provides a tagging system that allows an object to be tracked, located, and identified using wireless communication.  information regarding a product or item is contained in small chips that are attached to a pallet, a shipping container, or the item itself.  the information contained on the chip can be received by an rfid reader and effective supply chain management technology  12 information can be decoded and stored on servers.  the information is sent through a radio frequency and the frequency contains the products' electronic product code, or epc.  information including the epc is saved on the rfid chip; the chip has a miniature antenna.  a numbering system identifies all items as unique.  when a reader scans a rfid chip, the chip will return the items epc. information stored on the chip includes the code header, the epc manager number, the object class, and the serial number.  the header contains the information regarding the type of epc including the length and type.  the epc manager number maintains and identifies the company or entity.  the object class shows the class of the item.  the object class is a similar practice to the sku.  finally, the serial number identifies the instance of the object class (poirier, 2006). an entire rfid system consists of an rfid tag, an antenna, a rfid reader, application software, and middleware.  the rfid tag can be either a read-only tag or a read/write tag.  the tag broadcasts the information about the item to a reader that is requesting the item.  the antenna transmits and receives data through radio frequency.  readers send a signal to the rfid tag and receive a response.  the reader receives commands from the application software.  in addition, the reader can provide the rfid chip with power when the rfid tag is a passive tag.  the application software can be programmed to accommodate the functions of the user.  the middleware is used between the hardware and application software (poirer, 2006).  rfid chips can be active or passive.  passive chips have no internal power supply and rely on the rfid reader to provide a small amount of power to active the chip.  passive tags are cheaper and smaller because of the lack of an internal power supply.  active chips contain an internal power source which allows the chip to transmit a effective supply chain management technology  13 stronger data signal over long ranges.  the chip can also contain a larger internal memory.  the internal memory and internal power source allows the tag to store data that is sent from the receiver.  active tags are larger than passive tags, but they are more powerful and have the ability to write data, making the active tags more functional (myerson, 2007). while there are no current universal standards in rfid technology, there has been a considerable amount of work done to develop standards for different applications.  an organization called the international organization for standardizing or iso created standards for tracking animals called iso 11784.  additionally, the iso has created standards for payment systems and smart cards.  the auto-id center has been trying to create low-cost rfid tags for supply chain management and cpg's.  the technology they began using was ultra-high frequency band or uhf.  the auto id center also developed a protocol and licensed it to the epcgobal.  the protocol is made royalty-free for manufacturers and users.  the uhf protocol was originally designed to communicate with different classes as technology advanced.  class 1 is a passive rfid tag that is read only.  class 2 is a passive tag system that has 6kb of read and writes memory.  class 3 is a semi-passive tag with a built in battery for increased readability.  class 4 is an active tag that has a built in battery and additionally transmits to a signal.  class 5 is also an active tag that can only communicate with class 5 tags and devices.  auto-id gave its class 0 and class 1 protocol to the epcglobal and the epcglobal approved class 0 and class 1 as epc standards (myerson, 2007). class 0 and class 1 rifd both possess downsides.  they do not work with one another and are also incompatible with the iso standards.   both classes also operate effective supply chain management technology  14 using two different frequencies, one that is used to send and another to receive.  this issue has caused problems in some countries where regulations prohibited their use.  a new protocol was introduced in 2004 that included a second generation of rfid tags.  the tags were developed to work within iso standards, but were not compatible with previous generation 1 and 2 classes (myerson, 2007). rfid in consumer packaged goods using rfid in the cpg industry is a relatively new concept.  the idea took a large leap when wal-mart, the world's largest retailer, began to mandate that the supplier begin to use rfid and electronic product codes to track pallets and cases.  wal-mart met with its top 100 suppliers and introduced the concept of rfid and requested that suppliers begin using the technology for distribution to its stores.  their rfid strategy was announced in 2003, and top suppliers were mandated to tag all pallets by 2005. the goal included adding the next 100 suppliers to the mandate every year.  wal-mart believed that a transition to rfid would improve efficiencies in logistics, improve out-of-stocks, and improve sales (supply chain digest, 2009).  although wal-mart gained support from some suppliers such as proctor and gamble and unilever, many suppliers have been slow in achieving implementation.  seven years after wal-mart's initial mandate, only 600 of their 60,000 suppliers have been able to adapt to the changes.  the roi has been debated among suppliers. an average low cost rfid tag costs 10-15 cents. compared to the standard bar code, this is relatively high, particularly among item level tagging. this makes it difficult for suppliers to invest.  wal-mart is not the only retailer to have difficulty implementing an rfid strategy.  retailers such as albertsons, best buy and target have all tried test pilots using effective supply chain management technology  15 their own rfid programs, but have scaled back implementation because of high costs and other difficulties, similar to what wal-mart experienced (duvall, 2007). in 2007, wal-mart scaled back its implementation of rfid.  instead of having all pallets tagged with rfid, they focused on shipments to sam's club (wal-mart's wholesale chain). they also focused on promotional displays and products in wal-mart retail stores, and began to test the impact of the technology in improving category management in some departments (supply chain digest, 2009).  wal-mart is still pushing forward with its mandate for suppliers to comply with its rfid system.  beginning in january of 2008, wal-mart charged suppliers with a $2.00 fee for every pallet that was not tagged with an rfid tag shipped to sams club (weier, 2008). the charge covered the cost that wal-mart had to pay in order for the company to affix a tag.  additionally, wal-mart announced plans to implement pallet level tagging in 17 distribution centers by 2008, case and mix pallet tagging by 2009, and selling-unit tagging in all distribution centers by october 2010 (duvall, 2007). benefits of rfid in consumer packaged goods rfid technology has a number of benefits over the current barcode system which is currently used in the cpg industry.  rfid technology has benefits that include reduced warehouse and distribution costs, reduced point of sale costs, increased inventory accuracy, reduced theft, and reduction in out of stock items at retail.  rfid also provides the benefits of allowing a product or item to be tracked in a real time basis as it progresses through the supply chain.  items can be tracked using an rfid reader, which eliminates the need to physically scan an item with a handheld scanner.  a rfid can also scan multiple items at the same time, eliminating the need for a barcode scanner that effective supply chain management technology  16 scans items individually.  rfid tags can also hold and store much more information than a traditional barcode system.  some rfid tags can read and write data allowing information to be recorded, tracked, and changed through the supply chain (poirier, 2006). according to a survey by aberdeen group in 2007 the top objectives of rfid in manufacturing included asset tracking, production efficiency, supply chain visibility, raw materials management, mandate compliance, and finished goods inventory control (zebra, 2007). in relation to retail stores, rfid technology can greatly reduce out of stock items and provide better visibility of products within the store.  out of stock items are still major factors in the loss of sales at store level. ensuring that an item is in stock and available to a retailers' customer is extremely important to many organizations.  for example wal-mart currently has its store divided into multiple departments with each managed by a department manager or zone manager.  every day, wal-mart protocol requires their manager to scan out of stock item slots with handheld computers, called telxons.  the telxon will inform the manager if the item is really in stock in the backroom.  if it is, the manager will add the item to the \\\"pick-list\\\".  the pick-list will then be used to notify a backroom inventory specialist to select the item and place it in the sales slot as soon as possible.  if the item is not in the located in the backroom, the handheld unit will tell the employee that the inventory is not located within the store. the device will inform the employee that the product is in transit, or needs to be ordered from the distribution center.   effective supply chain management technology  17 this telxon system provides an adequate way to measure and adjust quantities, but there are some problems within the system.  on-hand inventory can be inaccurate caused by issues such as; theft or \\\"mis-ships\\\" (items received are mislabeled or the received quantity was inaccurate).  therefore the inventory system shows available product that is not really in the store.  this issue becomes more complicated as the reenlistment process is reordering based on a wrong inventory level.   another common problem is when a product is displayed in multiple departments or checkout registers.  when an item has multiple placements, an item might be out of stock in some locations, but not in others.  an example would be a frontend checkout display in a mass retailer.  a retail store might have a plan-o-gram which instructs the store to display the same items on ever checkout station.  if these items are located on regularly open registers, they will quickly run out of stock.  these same items that are displayed on seldom open checkout registers will carry excess inventory.  many systems such as wal-mart use a replenishment program based on average sales of items, insuring that inventory levels are replenished without having a large amount of back-stock inventory.  when a high traffic register is used, the inventory is depleted and not automatically restocked.  therefore these systems using average sales or point of sales are not replenished correctly.  these issues can lead to an on-going problem, creating mainly out of stocks, unless the system is corrected manually by a store employee. accurate forecasting and customer specific marketing is another benefit of rfid.  according to a study by auto id, using the technology can improve demand planning forecast accuracy by 10-20%.  planning and forecasting are important to every organization because they reduce out of stocks, lower the risk of unsalable items, reduce effective supply chain management technology  18 excess inventory levels, and improve efficiencies in distribution and other related costs   (smith, 2002). the reduction of inventory costs for the manufacturers from rfid can provide enormous savings both in \\\"inventory on-hand\\\" as well as reduced \\\"finished inventory\\\". it is exciting to think that finished goods can be sent directly to wholesalers or in some case to the retailers themselves. this process would eliminate the need for regional storage warehouses or mixing warehouses for companies who produce certain products in select plants and them merge or mix them in consolidated warehouse for re-shipment to usually the distributor. these freight and storage savings can be passed on to the consumer in the way of lower pricing which will increase sales. another advantage of rfid technology for the retailer is that the chip can identify where the item was actually purchased, thereby helping them control receiving returns from customers who purchased the product from another retailer. returned goods cause especially large and costly problems for big box stores like wal-mart, sam's, costco, etc as they have liberal return policies.  the labor savings derived from rfid, does not just mean fewer checkers and support personnel but it will increase employees productivity. all retailers want to create a better, faster, and more enjoyable shopping experience to attract and maintain customers.   rfid technology will provide the \\\"perfect order\\\" from the distributor or from the retailers own distribution centers. currently, there are large costs associated with the issuance of credits and the resulting management of account payables, due to mis-selects, overages and shortages. mclane estimates that every credit that is written costs over $25 in labor to process (mclane, 2009). these costs can be greatly reduced or eliminated with a rfid system for all parties in the supply chain.   effective supply chain management technology  19 unsaleable items are those that are at the wrong place, or at the wrong time, or appear damaged. an example of the latter would include; displaying snow shovels in the middle of the summer, or still having christmas candy on the shelves in february.  these types of errors bloat the inventory in terms of dollars, take up valuable space to sell fresh or current inventory, and finally necessitates the need to discount these items. selling old or out of season inventory items also implants the idea in the shoppers mind that the store has stale product.  in a study by the unsaleable committee, and organization made of producers and retailers, the grocery channel unsaleables were at a 1.27% of sales, which is nearly 5 billions dollars in lost sales (smith, 2002). invoice accuracy is also an issue that affects accurate forecasting; what is listed as being received must be what is truly received.  products with short shelf life or have expiration codes need to be accurately forecasted to reduce waste.  inaccurate data and human error can lead to further inaccurate forecasting with the final results as either over/under supply.  there are also hidden costs associated with returns and credits (smith, 2002). as stated previously, out of stocks within the retail store is very costly to business.  according to a report by the gma it is estimated on average that 8% are not in stock in an average supermarket.  the study noted that promotional items or advertised products were out of stock nearly 20% of the time.  having out of stock items not only means lost sales, but also can lead to customer dissatisfaction, and maybe encourage the shopper to go elsewhere.  according to a research paper completed by accenture for supermarket trade, potential for lost sales of 3% per year equals nearly $12 billion dollars in lost sales revenue (smith, 2002). effective supply chain management technology  20 currently many cpg companies gain forecasting knowledge by analyzing data from companies such as a.c. nielson, information resources, inc. or iri, and organizational databases such as wal-mart's retail link.  many times companies will invest in other point of sale information and data made available from distributors and wholesalers.  data from resources such as a.c nielson and iri are typically out-of-date and based on estimates and mathematical equations.  information from organizational databases such as wal-mart retail link can be valuable, but contains a relatively narrow view as it is based on one company.   furthermore, information gathered from retail link may not explain why sales data changes so radically week to week.  variables such as weather, promos, and inventory levels are not included in the retail link data (smith, 2002). rfid will provide additional communication and data sharing throughout the supply chain.  rfid will also allow product to be tracked in real time and throughout the sales process.  better inventory data in warehouses means higher accuracy will be communicated to manufacturers and retailers.  according to auto id they predict that forecasting estimates can improve by 10-30% by implementing rfid technology.  additionally, auto id predicts that manufacturers can see a 5-30% reduction in inventory levels, 2-13% reduction in warehouse and transportation costs, 1-5% in increased sales, and 10-50% reduction in lead times.  they also predict that retailers can improve shelf rate sales movement in retailers by 5-30%, 5-10% lower inventory levels, and 2-10% in increased overall retail sales (smith, 2002). with an rfid based inventory, system retailers have a stronger knowledge exchange and better visibility of all products within their store. a fully operational rfid effective supply chain management technology  21 system, where every item has a rfid tag, the retailer would have accurate knowledge of all inventories and where the inventory is actually located in the store.  from the time the product arrives at the store, to the moment the item is purchased by the consumer; the store could be able to monitor the inventory level and the inventory location. additionally, the accurate inventory will cause the correct replenishment order to be placed or transmitted. the rfid system will reduce human error and eliminate current system errors.   another benefit of rfid is active management.  active management allows for organizations not only to see the location of their product, but also the environment where it is stored.  for example, an organization that manufactures a product that is temperature sensitive such as yogurt could monitor and record the temperatures throughout the supply chain.  the organization would not only know that the product may be damaged or unsalable, but also be able to alert the distributor or warehouse and inform them of the problem or issue before the product is received and shipped to the retailer (agarwal, 2001). theft and security is another major advantage of rfid.  barcode and upc technology do not offer protection from theft.  security tags are often applied to high ticket items such as electronics, but that can be costly and time consuming.  rfid tags can offer additional security throughout the products distribution and retail life.  rfid readers can warn stores and management when products are accidently or deliberately being taken from the store.  organizations will be able to better control shrinkage by understanding the major causes on a real time basis (agarwal, 2001). effective supply chain management technology  22 products with short shelf life or with expiration codes, for example milk or eggs, can be monitored to ensure they are rotated and sold before expiration.  in many cases retailers fail to rotate their inventory, placing replenished items in front of older products.  this can be costly to the retailer in lost sales due to expiration dates.  additionally, customers can become frustrated when they arrive home and notice that the product they purchased is expired or near expiration.  this can impact customer loyalty and discourage repeat business. rfid can identify products based on their expiration data and ensure the product is properly rotated. out of date product can then be quickly removed from shelf (agarwal, 2001). product recalls and other mandates create issues for retailers, suppliers, and manufacturers. often times, rather than pulling the batch number of a certain product, the entire product line is pulled because it is difficult or impossible to trace the specific product or batch.  for example, in december of 2009, johnson and johnson announced a recall of tylenol arthritis pain tablets.  it was reported that this product had an unusual odor and there were reports of consumers becoming ill.  the lack of specific information caused the recall to include many tylenol pain relievers and also motrin, rolaids, and benadryl which are also manufactured at the same plants.  the total amount of product recalled included more than 54 million bottles.  some of the products were found to contain a chemical called 2, 4, 6-tribomaonisole, it is now known that the odor was traced to a chemical used to treat wooden pallets that johnson and johnson used to transport these items in only a few of their distributors (berman, 2010).   recalls costs retailers and manufacturers millions of dollars in lost sales and potentially destroy an entire brand or company.  technology found in rfid can streamline the of recall process.  rfid effective supply chain management technology  23 products can be programmed to contain much greater data on each chip enabling the company to quickly zero in on a specific product rather than using the current \\\"shotgun\\\" process. rfid technology has the potential to save the entire supply chain substantial amounts in labor costs. labor costs are a significant expense in the total supply chain, contributing to approximately 30% of overall supply chain costs (chappell, 2002).  reducing this cost can provide a large cost savings throughout the industry.  many current systems use a process of manually scanning product and location barcodes.  for example, the current receiving and check-in process requires that an item or case barcode must be manually scanned and checked-in.  items are compared to a receiving checklist and labels are printed.  this process can be time consuming and is prone to human error.  organizations can reduce labor costs by implementing an rfid system where labor is not required to manually scan barcodes.  cases and items that are brought into the distribution center will immediately be read, inventory amounts automatically adjusted, and the storage location of the items recorded.  items are quickly identified and inaccuracies can quickly be resolved.   when the items are moved to a new location within the warehouse, the rfid tag will automatically display its new location.  this will eliminate the need for an employee to scan the product and the location and eliminates the need to verify its location (palmer, 2004).  when an order is filled, employees can select items and the system will automatically adjust inventory levels and verify the accuracy of the order.  when shipping, items can be loaded directly on the outbound trailer or rail car and shipped.  in automated environments, the speed in which conveyers operate will increase because there is no need for lasers to scan the product's barcode.  in effective supply chain management technology  24 a study by accenture they estimated that using rfid could reduce labor costs by between 5 and 40 percent (chappell, 2002).  another advantage of rfid can be found at the retail store's checkout station. currently a typical shopping experience involves customers selecting products throughout the store and putting the items in baskets or carts.  when the customer completes their shopping, they proceed to the checkout counter.   items are taken out of the shopping cart and placed on a conveyor belt; a cashier will then manually scan items with a barcode laser scanner, which is typically located on the bottom of the register.  the cashier will also have a handheld scanner that will be used to scan hard to reach barcodes on larger items.  this process can be cumbersome and slow and can lead to frustration.  products with damaged barcodes or products, such as water, can interfere with the scanner, forcing the cashier to manually enter the products upc number into the cash register.  this procedure can holdup the checkout process and cause delays for all customers.  with an rfid checkout system, all items can be read without even taking the product out of the cart.  when a consumer walks through a tunnel reader with their shopping cart, all items in the cart are automatically scanned by the rfid reader.  this method can greatly improve the checkout process by reducing the time a customer waits and will improve the overall customer satisfaction rate.  additionally, the process can reduce the amount of labor needed by the retailer to operate checkouts and increase the accuracy of the order.  this can save the retailer meaningful labor costs and will increase inventory turns due to improved accuracy.  improved marketing is another advantage of an rfid system.  customer shopping habits can be tracked while they are in the store.  retailers can benefit from this effective supply chain management technology  25 knowledge by updating their plan o grams so that related or complimentary items are displayed in areas and shelf locations that will stimulate increased customer purchases (sharpels, 2005).  rfid also allows greater sales tracking data that can be used to inform retailers of what is being sold by zip code, enabling stores to stock what the consumers want to buy, rather than using regional or national plan-o-grams.  this increased data accuracy can also stimulate mark-downs on product before short dating or out of date occurs. real time data also enables the manufacturer and retailer to plan \\\"linked\\\" promotional activity whereby a well priced popular item is sold along with a lesser known product to stimulate the weaker items sales growth, i.e.: hair conditioner linked with shampoo.  real time data also gives the retailer to quickly assess whether their current item placement, pricing, or promotional activity needs to be changed.    obstacles of rfid in consumer packaged goods while rfid technology can benefit the consumer packaged goods industry, it faces a number of challenges and constraints that has slowed the adoption by retailers, manufacturers, and distributors.  these factors include the high costs of the silicon chips themselves, as well the hardware and software needed to operate systemically with all types of chips, including \\\"smart chips\\\".  in addition, there are a multitude of other challenges that have slowed the implementation across the cpg industry.   the high price of the rfid chip has historically been the largest obstacle in the adoption of rfid in the cpg industry. manufacturers, retailers, and distributors have been hesitant to adopt rfid technology because it costs so much more than traditional barcodes and upc systems.  it is a gigantic task for an industry to totally change how they do business. retailers are beginning to recognize some of the benefits that an rfid effective supply chain management technology  26 system can have on their bottom line.  it reduces out-of-stock and shrinkage, and provides a better method for managing inventory and improves forecasting.  manufacturers and distributors are also hesitant to adopt the technology; they too need to be convinced of the benefits for them, not just the retailer.   typically an rfid passive tags cost around $0.15 - $1.00 per tag in the united states.  prices are subject to cost variations due to the technology and complexity depending on the type of the tag (poirier, 2006).  these high costs makes it virtually impossible for a manufacturer of smaller cpg's to implement the technology.  for example the cost of a 3 pack of trident white spearmint gum is $1.41.  retailers in the cpg industry usually look for a profit margin of around 30%.  therefore the retail price of the 3 pack of gum would be 1.98, with a $0.57 profit to the store.  if a rfid tag were to be applied to every pack of gum, the cost of $0.20 would have large effects on the profit margin within the store.  the retail store would have to raise their prices to the consumer or the manufacturer would have to greatly lower or eliminate the profit of every item sold (cadbury profit margin, 2010). while rfid tags are not currently implemented on every individual product, they are beginning to be used in case and pallet level tagging.  this method works for tracking and validates delivery, and also allows the ability to track and monitor the movement in the supply chain.  still it fails to derive the true benefits of having a total rfid tag system for inventory, security, and forecasting.  item level tagging would have to be implemented to realize the benefits of unit level handling.   recently auto-id has made advancements to lower the cost of rfid tags.  these tags are much less complex, and simply store the electronic product code of the product.  effective supply chain management technology  27 these chips are much smaller and much cheaper.    auto-id believes that they can soon begin to manufacture passive rfid chips for as little as $.05 (swamy, 2006). the cost of individual tags is not the only barrier to implementation; there are additional costs to the supply chain.  these costs involve applying the tags to the products, costs related to installing rfid tag readers in warehouses and manufacturing plants, costs associated with integration into legacy systems, cost in training employees and organization, and the cost of software and hardware solutions (myerson, 2006). concerns have been concerning the ability of rfid to accurately read certain products.  products such as water, metal, and other materials have caused delays and inaccuracies because of their inference with radio signals.  these products need special consideration when applying a tag because their material limits the read ranges.  the following table shows the read ranges of 915 mhz signals in feet (myerson, 2006).  table 1: read ranges of materials    plastic  metal, direct contact  metal, .06\\\" stand-off  glass  cardboard  free space  plywood  container insert 4.5 .5 .5 8 3.5 3.5 6 container tag 9.5 .25 .75 5 9 13 8 intelligent id

(myerson. 2006) effective supply chain management technology  28  global acceptance of a standard is another concern among the industry.  although there have been efforts made to create standards for rfid and radio frequency there has yet to be a complete accepted standard.  when dealing with a global distribution system, organizations must consider frequencies and standards throughout the world.  organizations are hesitant to invest large quantities of capital to promote a new technology when the current system of bar-coding is acceptable and already implemented. privacy is another major concern to the use of rfid technology in the cpg industry.  consumers and end users of a product that has been tagged with an rfid chip may be unaware of the extent technology and its many uses.  when gillette began piloting its test program within wal-mart, they enabled a security measure that would alert store personnel not only when restocking was needed, but also when high quantities of products had been removed that could possibly be the result of shoplifting.  the consumer advocacy group consumer against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering, also referred to as caspian, launched a campaign to alert consumer and advised to boycott gillette products.  many consumers then became aware of the potential privacy violations (poirier, 2006).  some states began looking at laws to protect consumers.       the actual implementation of a new technology into the industry is another obstacle in the adoption of rfid. the initial investment of installing hardware and software will be a significant cost to all members of the supply chain.  costs would include rfid readers, transponders, tags, and the systems and software to operate the effective supply chain management technology  29 technology. training and support services must also be developed and maintained.   additionally, software must be developed to insure that information gathered from the new system is gathered and stored properly so the information can be retrieved and used for business planning.   the amount of data that an rfid system will collect and store will demand much greater storage capacity than the current legacy systems.  organizations must consider the amount of data that the new system will collect and store and design software to manage the information (sharpels, 2005).    implementing the new system will also require the industry to maintain the new system with legacy systems.  while an organization moves to a new rfid supply chain system, there will be redundancies with their existing barcode system.  this will require the organization to maintain two separate systems that require maintenance for a significant period of time.  in addition, the two systems will require two separate operating systems for data collecting and software processes.  eventually, the new system will become the only system used, but the cost of maintaining an existing system while implementing a new system can be costly and difficult to maintain.          effective supply chain management technology  30 chapter 3 \\u2013 methodology  in order to better understand the benefits and obstacles of rfid, this paper will conduct a study of the mclane company.  the mclane company is a major distributor in  the consumer packaged goods industry, and conducts business with some of the largest manufactures and retailers in the world.  the current distribution model and technology used by the organization will be discussed and analyzed.  fill rates and replenish processes using barcode technology will be discussed to determine if a new technology such as rfid tags would improve fill rates, location, tracking, and efficiency. the mclane company was chosen because of their distribution depth pertaining to product mix and customer base.  they allowed full access to their colorado distribution facility.  they also allowed interviews to be conducted with executives in their logistics, information technology, and operational groups located in their corporate offices in temple, texas.  the only request which they made was the opportunity to review the thesis prior to submittal and also to use the study internally for focus groups assigned to rfid planning.     the case study was conducted by interviewing a number of mclane company employees and executive personnel over a 3 month period.  information from each department was analyzed to gain a broad overview of the company and its practices. detailed information, regarding mclane's current distribution practices, was recorded and formatted.  time was physically spent within one of mclane's warehouses located in longmont, co.  operations and practices within the warehouse were recorded and analyzed.  in addition, data regarding current fill rates, efficiencies, and practices were captured.  information was gathered from mclane's \\\"superior execution measurements\\\" effective supply chain management technology  31 which measures components of the business both internally and externally.  data such as timely delivery, order quality, and teammate productivity was gathered and analyzed.  some of the proprietary information gathered from the mclane company, particularly point of sale data from third parties, could not be directly referenced or included in this paper. the final section of the case study will include the recommendation for implementing a rfid system within the mclane company.  benefits and constraints of implementing a new rfid system will be analyzed.  finally, a business strategy for implementing an rfid system will be recommended.                  effective supply chain management technology  32 chapter 4 \\u2013 project analysis and results in order to understand the magnitude of implementing the new rfid system, it is beneficial to look at the distribution methods of a large wholesaler.  one such company is the mclane company of temple, texas.  the mclane company is a supply chain company that provides grocery and foodservice distribution to convenience stores, big box stores, restaurant chains, and drug stores.  they are a $34 billion dollar organization with over 15,000 employees making it one of the largest distributors of cpg in the united states (kimborough, 2009). mclane company operates 41 mega-distribution centers in the united states, one of which is located longmont colorado. weekly service is provided to nearly every zip code in the lower 48 states, and weekly service is available to both hawaii and alaska via barge delivery.  densely populated areas receive daily service when needed.  the customer base is divided into four basic groups of customers: convenience stores, big box retailers, military, and finally foodservice.  the grocery division handles the first three categories and the foodservice handles only national or large regional quick serve restaurant chains.  the current annual volume is reported to be approximately $34 billion and the company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the berkshire hathaway corporation (kimborough, 2009). the grocery division services more than 30,000 convenience stores with virtually everything that they stock, with the exception of alcohol and brand name soft drinks.  these are distributed directly by the individual manufacturers. the items they distribute include cigarettes, and other tobacco products, confections, dry groceries, refrigerated goods, frozen goods, paper products, janitorial supplies, and miscellaneous effective supply chain management technology  33 goods. the military business is similar with a heavier emphasis on cigarettes and tobacco products. the big box stores usually do their own distribution of the majority of their own products but rely on mclane to supplement their distribution when it is more cost effective.   mclane operates over three thousand multi-temperature semi trucks, which distribute; dry grocery, fresh, frozen, and dairy products.  many of mclane's customers that self distribute use only non-refrigerated trailers, so mclane saves them millions of dollars in capital that it would cost to convert to multi-temperature equipment (kimborough, 2009). mclane purchases all goods centrally, with the top hundred vendors supplying vmi (vendor managed inventory) services, a central purchasing department takes the remaining items and divides them into industry recognized categories and buys and manages these accordingly.  sophisticated buying formulas are used for replacement, with high emphasis on providing 99% fill rates on all categories except for cigarettes and tobacco which mclane guarantees 100% fill rates. many of the individual mclane customer contracts contain clauses that guarantee these high fill rates and some have penalties notated if mclane fails to provide them. these high fill rate guarantees also place enormous internal emphasis on inventory levels, as inventory turn becomes critical to mclane's profitability (kimborough, 2009). most goods are delivered to mclane by truck in full truck quantities, smaller vendors or specialty goods are received in ltl quantities. mclane backhauls approximately 40% of all the goods it sells and receives goods 7 days per week in all of its facilities. currently mclane stocks approximately 18,000 skus or items and sells goods in full case, break pack, or individual quantities. items that are less than full case effective supply chain management technology  34 receive an additional mark-up. mclane uses a sophisticated receiving process wherein all goods are scanned by smart handheld devices and are given a license plate or adhesive label which is placed of every skid, identifying the manufacturer, date received, item upc code, also a mclane code. this code can be scanned to guarantee that all goods, including imported goods are properly identified and traceable for recall/accounting reasons. all perishable products are probed to insure that proper temperature was maintained during the shipping process.  finally the license plate tells the forklift driver where to place the goods for easy retrieval for replenishment, but also places the higher moving items in locations that are the closest to the actual selection area (grogman, 2009). figure 1: mclane license plate example effective supply chain management technology  35  (jones t. mclane, 1998) smart handhelds are used by drivers when delivering product.  the system is intended to assist drivers in making more efficient and accurate deliveries.  it provides a method for drivers to verify delivery items quickly, handle credits, manage high value items, and record store deposits.  the smart handheld can used to scan mclane barcodes effective supply chain management technology  36 or upc.  products can be scanned by section, by container or case, or by individual item  (grogman, 2009). the system works by downloading load-specific billing and sales information into the delivery device.  the devices are then matched to the correct driver teams by dispatchers.  information such as container count by section, total number of full cases, and number of cigarettes for the driver to match against are provided.  the driver will then scan all items to verify the delivery of the product.  the driver will scan return credits and manually enter deposit counts.  the delivery report is printed and signed and the driver returns to the division for end day reports (grogman, 2009). the put-away process is accomplished using radio controlled data that is transmitted from the receiving data to dashboard mounted radio receivers on the forklifts; it instructs the operator where to put the product but also gives the process a put away priority in the event that the product is needed in a pick location quickly. the inbound data also automatically updates the available inventory which enables a real time perpetual inventory system (grogman, 2009). the next step is the receiving of the actual customer orders, which are received and held in an order collection data bucket and released based on a predetermined order delivery date and exact truck delivery time.  these orders are placed either directly in mass edi download communication (usually used by large national companies with their own mainframe support) or with smart handhelds,  wherein the customer uses the device to count their existing inventory and then reorders based on a standing inventory basis, or perhaps a more advanced customized approach using historical data that the shh provides.  mclane even has the ability to provide special shh software for a weekly fee effective supply chain management technology  37 which enables customers to order automatically in case of power outages or other related ordering problems. even more advanced software is available for a customer that adheres to a manufacturers program.  the marketing programs might require a constant in-stock or brand depth availability program that would mean large rebates if the retailer met the programs contract (lyon, 2010). smart handhelds is a device system that mclane provides to customers.  it provides an easy and efficient way for the retailer to view items and displays, as well as placing and uploading orders.  in addition, the device allows the retailer to download up to date information and receive messages and communication for mclane.  the device allows the retailer to scan upc barcodes; items can also be searched through item number and description.  the system will provide a purposed order based on order history at the department and at item level.  the handheld system helps improve order input quality, reduces order entry confusion, improves data accuracy, and improves the forecast based on item movement (lyon, 2010) below is a diagram overview of the mclane smart handheld ordering process flow. figure 2: system

category including newly authorized and distribution only categoriesupload order to mclane via dial up connectionreceive order confirmation number on unitorder received and processed by mclane once the orders are received either through mass edi transmissions or shh transmissions, they are automatically sorted by the mainframe order processing system which assigns each individual order a specific number.  this determines in what sequence the orders will be selected, loaded, and dispatched.  every customer has a predetermined delivery day and time which they selected.  the next major step is the actual printing of the invoices and the selection labels which will be the guide for the warehouse staff to pick the right item.  an average customer orders items which are in actually stored in seven different departments; dry full case, frozen full case, single sell, frozen/refrigerated single cell, cigarettes, and candy repack, . therefore the selection labels are printed by effective supply chain management technology  39 department and sent out for selection. these labels are coded with a myriad of data but the most important are: order number, load number, mclane item number, and pick location.  each selector works in a predetermined work area that might encompass anywhere from 15 to 100 feet. the selector has a glove like scanner affixed to one of their hands which has the bar code scanner on the index finger.  the selector picks up a sheet of labels, scans the main order code with his finger and a light will go in the specific bin of where the item to be selected is with an illuminated number indicating the number of items to be picked. the selector picks the correct number and turns out the light, the tote which contains the product then is placed on the conveyor and moves to the next zone where the process is repeated. finally the tote or case has traveled thru the entire department and is then sealed and sent to the high speed sortation conveyors which merge all products from all departments. the merge operator then asks for each order to be released and high speed push roads send the right product in the right order down conveyors which actually go right into a truck trailer. loaders are at the bottom of the conveyors and rescan each product to validate that it is the correct item going to the correct customer on the correct load.  the scan data also allows every selector to be tracked in terms of number of pieces selected by hour, same for the loaders, and in the event there is an error, the mis-selected can be traced back to the person who made the error (lyon, 2010). the truck is loaded and is dispatched at the proper time; orders are guaranteed to arrive within a two hour window, so customers can staff their receiving departments accordingly. all trucks are equipped with gps scanning antennae so a truck is constantly \\\"pinged\\\" to make sure that it is running on time and on the proper route. this same data effective supply chain management technology  40 can be accessed by the customer via the internet to find out where their truck is located exactly.  when the delivery is made, the drivers scan the cases and totes as they are placed in the customer's store. if there is a missing or damaged case or item, the driver can issue an electronic credit immediately.  the current standard which mclane has set for order error is .20% or 99.8% accuracy (lyon, 2010). transitioning to rfid while the current system is extremely efficient, mclane is always open to new and better technology.  they aim to be on the forefront of the latest innovations.  they want to not only stay competitive, but to stay ahead of their competitors by providing the best and most accurate service.  they are always ready to adapt to change if it leads to better costumer service.  the size and volume of an organization such as mclane makes it difficult to implement even a small system change, much less a total overhaul in its core distribution model.   implementing an rfid system must be done by developing a business strategy that is well documented and defined.  first the benefits of the new system must be communicated and discussed with business partners and customers.  the system must be validated to ensure that customers understand how the system works and how it affects their business.  second the system must be rolled out in select waves and pilot programs.  customers that are interested in implementing and testing the new system should be the first to run pilot tests.  the services and functions of the new system must be given a standard or goals and then method developed to ensure that these functions and objectives are met.  finally, documentation and data collection must be done to measure effective supply chain management technology  41 the costs associated with the program.  sales and performance standards must be carefully analyzed and compared to previous results to obtain a benchmark.   it is the belief of mclane that a rfid system could increase their productivity in all areas. items could be received quicker and placed in the proper bins with fewer errors. the same is true for production selection speed and finally delivery order rates. perfect orders would be possible, and perfect orders mean high customer satisfaction. if one places a dollar value of running at a 99.8% accuracy rate, then the dollar impact from items that are either over, short or damaged equal over $60 million when the net sales are $30 billion per year. the conversion to the use of rfid tags has started, but like any other enormous project faces many challenges. not all manufacturers have the capital to invest in the equipment to affix the chip to their individual products. other major issues are created when the usa continues to import goods from third world countries to save on product costs and sell at the lowest prices. lower costs sometimes mean lesser adherence to our identification specifications.  what are the hidden distribution costs associated with non-rfid labeled products? the solution lies in several types of approaches. the first is one in which a separate third party company installs and operates the rfid equipment at the manufacturing site on a fee basis. the manufacturer would not have to make major capital investments and could pass along the costs to the consumer, or by maintaining their prices by recouping the costs by better managing the entire manufacturing process. better data will both reduce raw or finished goods and more accurate sales data will aid them in producing inventory of what is selling.   effective supply chain management technology  42 another solution is for distributors, such as mclane to provide the rfid chip for a fee, charging back the cost to the manufacturers. mclane could affix to every case or individual item a customized rfid chip which would be produced from blank chips. this process would replace what mclane is currently doing with their own label process but would require major capital investments in all their centers to use chips versus labels.                      effective supply chain management technology  43 chapter 5 - conclusion  rfid technology has an important future role in the supply chain network.  this paper has focused on consumer packaged goods, but similar savings, accuracy, and speed are applicable to numerous other classes of trade. any new system or technology requires capital, time, and planning to proceed. however the first real first step is to expose the merits of rfid technology to every segment of the supply chain, including the consumer. this paper exposes and explores the details and benefits of this new technology, but in order to succeed, the term rfid must become a household word.  a strong recommendation is that a joint committee should be formed by the companies who would most benefit from its implementation;   silicon chip manufacturers, hardware manufactures, software development firms, etc.  their first order of business is to fund presentation and media materials that will educate and establish the benefits of this revolutionary new technology.  all forms of media have to be controlled to deliver a consistent message.  keeping \\\"consistent\\\" as the main component, custom detailed versions have to be developed for every step in the supply management chain.  the type of detail and benefits will be different for the manufactures, distributors, transporters, importers, retailers (national and independent), and finally the consumer. wal-mart has already made progress in advancing the technology, which should give them a head start.  distributors, such as mclane, with existing automated platforms will also have an advantage over those employing manual techniques. this same advantage applies to previously mentioned manufactures, such as proctor& gamble, who are currently working with wal-mart by applying rfid chips to their top selling items. effective supply chain management technology  44 the critical challenge is to educate the consumer as to what rfid technology is and how it will benefit them, stressing lower retail prices as the main outcome. all the media used; print, radio, television, or internet based, has to be pro-active in anticipating questions and providing answers.  questions such as, \\\"are my personal shopping habits being divulged?\\\" or \\\"how do i know that i paid the right price for an individual item?\\\" can be answered before the consumer can even ask them.  the technology can be embraced and supported even before it reaches full roll out status. the entire conversion process will take time, tests musts be run, mistakes made, and the resulting learning incorporated as solutions.  however the final product will deliver a superior technology which will move the entire supply chain forward into the future; better, faster, cheaper.

institute of retail managementpage 40   oxirm research themesthe retail digest   page 41today, the terms 'supply chain' and 'supply chain management' are in common use. in the global economy, supply chain is part of everyday business across industries, and retailing is a leading example. on this 25th anniversary of the oxford institute of retail management we look at how the concept of supply chain management was introduced in retailing and how it has evolved over time. this exercise is based on a selective review of oxirm publications between 1990 and 2010, mainly articles from the retail digest (formerly the european retail digest).supply, distribution, and sourcing have always existed in retailing, even when they were labelled differently. international and even transcontinental trade have their precedents from centuries ago, when products were imported from all parts of the new world to europe, and local goods exported in the opposite direction. what has changed, however, is scale, speed, integration, transparency and control. today's retailers have opportunities to manage and control the end-to-end flow of goods and associated information. to achieve the current level of supply chain integration, well over a decade was needed, during which different concepts, ideas and technical solutions were proposed, tried, adopted or rejected. in 1995, the european retail digest included an article by henk de wilt and trichy krishnan1, following an oxirm european retailing seminar dedicated to the concept of supply chain management. so let's look how the concept of supply chain management evolved in retailing, how this was reflected in oxirm publications, and what was written about supply and logistics both before that digest article in 1995 and after.supply chain in the 1990s: birth and focus on efficiencyeven though supply chain management was present in the retail literature in the late 1980s and early  1990s, its function was still largely considered as operational, as part of the  retail distribution system. however, the potential strategic impact was noted by eminent retail academic and prolific writer john fernie in his book published in 1990 on retail distribution management. the european retail digest was established in 1993 as a flagship publication for the oxford institute of retail management. the quarterly publication's aim was and remains to bring rigorous research and sound practice to academics, practitioners, analysts and commentators focused on the retail industry. earlier oxirm research was published in the series of oxford reports of retailing. in 1992, following the signing of the maastricht treaty that created a common market for 12 countries in europe, reports concentrated on retail internationalisation, where the importance of supply chain was acknowledged. free flow of goods across borders and transport deregulation influenced supply chain design, encouraging a european perspective instead of focusing at the national level. the creation of the common trans-european transport network (ten) was actively supported by the european commission with the establishment of 'transport corridors', while changes in eastern and central europe opened new markets and provided lower-cost manufacturing. one of the internal success factors required for internationalisation was control over supply chains, which allows high responsiveness to changes in consumer tastes, as explained in the introduction to the oxford report on retail in the run-up to the 1992 treaty3. the importance of control over the supply chain, and the blurring of the division between retailing, distribution and manufacturing was discussed in the 1988 oxrim report written by alan treadgold and ross davies4.  in 1993, the concept of supply chain management as the next step in the development of physical distribution management and logistics management was already present in retailing, with a dedicated chapter in books, such as gary davies book on trade marketing strategy5. a similar trend was reflected in the european retail digest. efficient customer response (ecr) and its implications for just-in-time grocery supply chain were discussed, with the main focus on increased efficiency in the assortment, replenishment, promotions, and new product introductions. however this discussion was mainly based on us examples, revealing opportunities for efficiency improvements in the uk and france6. key drivers for supply chain developmentincreasing retailing concentration, centralisation and powerconcentration of

packaging in supply chains1999: focus on costs and  efficiency, globalisation; european supply chain extended into central europe; e-commerce and  information technology2000: local, regional supply chains, local sourcing2001: supply chain performance measurement2003: benchmarking in supply chains2004: ethics and work standards2005: 'organic' supply chains2007: supply chains and impact sustainabilitysource: the european retail digest12. ernst b.

sustainable supply chain management is the culmination of a three-year search for best practices in supply chain and logistics internationally. this book, written for supply chain and logistics managers and in cooperation with practitioners, answers questions such as:-  what is a successful supply chain strategy?-  how should supply chain performance be measured?-  how should organisation be managed?-  how should stakeholders be influenced?-  how can unexpected events be incorporated?we include examples from a wide range of real-life case studies, and synthesise the learning from these many different situations to provide the fundamental building blocks at the centre of successful logistics and supply chain management.environmental and social dimensions33, as well as differences in cultures and the different needs of different countries, including oxirm's continued interest in developments in india34,35.supply chains today: latest oxirm researchbetween 2006 and 2010, oxirm members (including the author of this article) carried out research for the european commission, as part of the bestlog (best practices in logistics) project team. we looked at links  between supply chain and sustainable development, including areas such as: supply chain performance measurement36, education, best practices, and the transferability of best practices across industries, sectors, countries and regions37. our research was based not only on the academic literature and an analysis of existing case studies, but also our study of different supply chain practices across europe. we ran a number of workshops with policymakers and practitioners. the project covered several industrial sectors, and retailers, due to their important role in the supply chain, were well-represented. we collaborated with retailers such as ikea, marks & spencer, inditex and auchan, as well as with third-party logistics providers that work with retailers such as wincanton and unipart. while the bestlog project was formally completed, its work is carried forward by the european logistics association (visit elabestlog platform at www.elabestlog.org to see reports, analysis and best practice case studies \\u2013 including cases from the retail sector).during the bestlog research we confirmed and indentified several main themes, which are summarised in a forthcoming book. the aim of the project was to help managers to develop supply chains that are sustainable in three dimensions: economic, social and environmental. while it is easy to label supply chains 'green' for marketing purposes, to be sustainable in the long-term the whole chain should deliver economic value for all its participants. however, increasing centralisation, outsourcing of transportation and the tendency to design global supply chains creates external costs for the environment and society. as a result of supply chain redesign there is an increased need for transport services, especially in its most flexible form \\u2013 road transport. external costs associated with transport include pollution, congestion and accidents, which also negatively influence retailers in terms of reduced speed, flexibility, costs, and potential damage to the company reputation. thus in the long-term, a reduction of the negative impacts could be profitable for all supply chain members. such a process requires the inclusion of sustainability issues into strategy and long-term planning, and the development of measures that reflect the impact of the supply chain on economic, social and environmental dimensions (see figure). the integration of products, processes, knowledge and infrastructure, as well as communication with all the relevant stakeholders is essential. as two large markets, india and china, develop rapidly, there is an opportunity to provide for the rising customer demand. however, this further increase in the scope of activities requires new skills to operate in different cultural and political contexts. in the search for efficiency and economy of scale, there is also the issue of how to maintain supply chain flexibility, agility in the face of uncertainty, and how to manage the expected and unexpected risks, as the supply chain become global.nowadays, the role of supply chain management is different, having evolved from being a supportive function, through becoming a core competence, to the stage where it enables the increased power of retailers over suppliers. today, retail has become the last step to the consumer in an integrated supply chain that links not only different markets, but also cultures, with the aim of delivering value to all its participants.1231cetinkaya et al.balkan cetinkaya \\u00b7 richard cuthbertson, graham ewer \\u00b7 thorsten

supply chains, but recognises that in order to be truly sustain-able, supply chains must operate within a realistic financial structure, as well as contribute value to our society. supply chains are not sustain-able unless they are realistically funded and valued. thus, a real defini-tion of sustainable supply chain management must take account of all relevant economic, social and environmental issues.this book contains examples from a wide range of real-life case studies, and synthesizes the learnings from these many different situations to provide the fundame tal building blocks at the

customer expectations and economic performance  gerald lang bem bordeaux management school, france ecole polytechnique preg-crg, france gerald.lang@bem.edu    abstract:  increasingly, store-based retailers are opening an additional online sales channel and becoming multi-channel retailers. the integration of these different channels raises the question how to redefine the strategic marketing elements and the operations, as the two channels have different constraints and require different competences. this multi-channel retailing has major impacts on the operations and the supply-chain management. order fulfillment for the customers using the different sales channels is a key challenge, as customers are directly impacted from the performance of this process. in this paper, we will highlight the different strategic elements and operational challenges to be addressed by a multi-channel retailer. in order to evaluate the match between a fulfillment system and a multi-channel business model, we propose a framework analyzing the overall performance of different fulfillment systems regarding the two dimensions customer expectations and economic performance.  key words: multi-channel, retail, fulfillment, distribution \\xa0hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  2  introduction a growing number of traditional store-based retailers are becoming multi-channel retailers by opening an additional online-channel to offer their customers multiple ways of buying and interaction. at the same time, former pure online-retailers are opening stores or physical pick-up points to allow their customers physical interaction and product pick-up. multi-channel retailing got primary attention principally in the field of multi-channel marketing (e.g. wirtz, 2008). marketing literature and scholarly research address multi-channel marketing mainly focusing on customer behavior on the one side (e.g. venkatesan et al, 2007) and the conflicts between channels on the other side (e.g. falk et al, 2007; avery et al, 2009). several authors (e.g. schröder, 2005; schobesberger, 2007; heinemann 2008, 2009) analyze different multi-channel strategies and implications on a retailers\\' marketing mix.  whereas operational implications of online retailing have received attention since the end of the 1990s (e.g. turban et al, 2009; swaminathan & tayur, 2003), specific analysis of operational implications of multi-channel retailing remains scarce. agatz et al (2008) reviewed the specific supply chain management issues of internet fulfillment in a multi-channel environment. they identified an important number of topics relevant for e-fulfillment, but recognized that there are only very few dedicated models on multi-channel retailing.  multi-channel retailers with different business models are using different fulfillment systems to deliver the products to their customers: the online shop of the french retailer fnac (cultural and electronics products), fnac.com, started its online activity completely separated from its store activity, with different warehouse locations and fulfillment organizations. they gradually integrated their logistics activities and are operating today a fully integrated warehouse, preparing deliveries for the stores as well as for the individual online customers. tesco.com, the online shop of the major uk retailer tesco, prepares the customer\\'s orders exclusively in the tesco store next to the customer (smith & sparks, 2009). so does monoprix.fr, the online shop of the french city-center supermarket chain monoprix. these observations suggest that a specific multi-channel business model may induce a specific, most suitable fulfillment system. if this is the case, it should then be possible to evaluate how a fulfillment system fits a given business model.  hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  3  from an operational point of view, fulfillment systems have to be mainly time- and cost-efficient. from a strategic marketing point of view, the fulfillment system has to be able to meet the customers\\' expectations created by the chosen business model. we therefore propose to develop a qualitative framework to evaluate how a specific multi-channel fulfillment system matches the business model of multi-channel retailers both in terms of the expectations of their customers on the one hand and the economic performances on the other hand. this framework should serve as basis for further empirical studies. our paper is organized in two parts: in the first part, we will highlight the main characteristics of multi-channel retailing and present the major elements of the retailers\\' strategy, the retail mix, which have to be adapted to a multi-channel retailing strategy. 1 we then will explore the specific operational challenges to be faced when operating a multi-channel activity.  this first part will be completed with the presentation of the five major multi-channel fulfillment systems used to deliver products to the customers. in the second part, we will propose a qualitative analysis framework in order to evaluate the overall performance of a given fulfillment system, combining the two dimensions \\'customer expectations\\' and \\'economic performance\\'. the parameters of the framework as well as its applications will be based on the analysis of the strategic and operational challenges developed in the first part. applying the analysis framework to the five major fulfillment systems leads us to discuss how each of the systems impacts the different parameters. we conclude our paper presenting managerial implications and suggested future research avenues to provide evidence if our framework is valid for our purpose.  methodology our analysis is based on the one hand on our longitudinal industry observation of retailers\\' practices, completed with the analysis of company information and press articles. moreover,                                                  1 in our paper, we will concentrate on multi-channel retailers operating at least several physical stores and an online sales channel under the same brand and with the same types of products. moreover, we focus on the distribution of physical products, as dematerialized products do not need a physical distribution. we exclude as well specific configurations (which may nonetheless be dominant in particular sectors), like delivery from manufacturers or \\'complex assortments\\' (de koster, 2002) with bulky items and temperature sensitive goods. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  4  we conducted a series of interviews with french and uk senior operations managers and consultants in the retail sector. this observation allowed us to identify five major multi-channel fulfillment systems. to be able to evaluate these fulfillment systems regarding the two dimensions \\'economic performance\\' and \\'customer expectations\\', we have to identify the relevant parameters to integrate into our proposed framework. to do so, we analyzed marketing and operations general literature and scholarly research. exploration of the main strategy elements and operational challenges suggests number of parameters, indicating economic performance and customer expectations. we completed the identified parameters for evaluating customer expectations with dimensions from the servqual and netqual scales, measuring service quality perception from the customers. these parameters of our framework will be the dependent parameters, whereas the analyzed fulfillment systems will be the independent parameters. the exploration of the strategy factors and economic performances in the first part will allow us to apply the framework to the different fulfillment models by assessing the chosen performance parameters for each of the fulfillment systems. this shall provide a global evaluation for the each of the analyzed fulfillment systems.  strategy factors in multi-channel retailing the objective of this chapter is to summarize the context of multi-channel retailing as well as the main drivers for customer expectations and economic performances, which will enable us to identify the relevant parameters to use in our proposed framework. we will first present the main characteristics of multi-channel retailing. we then will investigate how the business model of a multi-channel retailer, characterized by different elements of the retail mix, will have to be adapted to a multi-channel strategy. an exploration of the major operational challenges for a multi-channel retailer will conclude this chapter.  multi-channel retailing: characteristics & customer behavior worldwide retailing is still dominated by the traditional store retailing, as 95% of food retailing and 80% of non-food retailing is realized through physical store-based retailers (dioux & dupuis, 2009), and online channels still represent only a small part of the total sales of the retailers. nevertheless, the motivation to open online sales-channels is strong due to the fact that e-commerce is realizing important annual turnover growth rates of about 30% for the hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  5  last few years, whilst most other retail forms stay stable or even decline. it is therefore interesting for a store retailer to invest in the creation of an additional online sales channel.  to implement a multi-channel strategy, retailers have to decide how to adapt their business model by adjusting the elements of the retail mix. at the same time, they have to face and resolve numerous operational challenges. in multi-channel retailing, customers expect at least the same level of service, counsel, and information on every channel (cf. heinemann, 2008). they expect to have identical customer loyalty programs across all channels, to be able to pay and pick up in the shop a product ordered on the web site, or to be able to return and exchange a product bought on the web in a store (berman & thelen, 2004). this channel hopping, which is a legitimate desire from a customer\\'s point of view, may nevertheless prove to be very difficult to implement for the retailer (vanheems, 2009). at the same time, online shoppers transfer their perception and experiences from a physical store to the website of the same brand and vice versa. customers tend to transpose a bad experience in one channel to the other channels of the same distributor (heinemann, 2008). as soon as their expectations are not fulfilled, they may adapt their purchasing habits, in the worst case stop buying with this retailer at all. it is therefore vital for a multi-channel retailer to make sure that every channel always meets the same level of expectations of the customers.  multi-channel retail mix  the retail mix consists of the mix of variables, including geographical location, merchandising, communication, price, services, product range and the personnel, which form the overall strategic marketing components of a retailing activity. it is the right mix of all these factors which determines if a retail concept is viable and successful. compared to a store retailer, the online sales channel is not only a new channel, but rather a new business model, where experiences from the traditional (brick and mortar) store channel may not be valid any more (heinemann, 2008). decisive success factors in a store like store location, sales personnel and material management in the shop are not the same success factors in an online sales channel. retailers which decide to open an e-commerce activity beside their existing store sales channel have to make sure that the co-existence of the two sales channels is working well. they have to decide how to adapt the different elements of the retail mix to each channel, hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  6  which product strategy to chose, which prices to apply, how to maintain a consistent image across the channels or what role to assign to each channel, to name a few (cf. berman & evans, 2009). we will briefly describe the major issues of some of the most important variables of the retail mix, assessing their relevance and importance in the store, the online channel and the multi-channel strategy. product mix the product mix is the major variable determining the activity of a retailer. it establishes if a retailer is specialized in selected product categories or a generalist. if a store based retailer opens an additional online channel, he has to decide which product mix he offers on this new channel. he can offer the identical product mix, a combination or part of his existing product mix or a completely different additional product mix on the new channel. location of the stores a physical store\\'s success is to a great extend influenced by its location. in order to determine if the location can attract the store\\'s target customers, a store based retailer has to analyze socioeconomic data, transport access, mix of competitors, costs and regulation issues. these parameters, decisive for a physical store, have generally no influence on a pure online sales channel, as access to the websites is independent from a geographical location. in a multi-channel strategy, however, the store location remains important; the density of the store network can be an important factor for offering store pick-up, returns and after sales services in the stores for their online customers. pricing the pricing policy applied in a store may take into consideration the environment of the store (socioeconomic characteristics of the geographical catchment area) and the price levels of the local competitors. such a local pricing policy which can be applied in a store is incompatible with the global price transparency in an online channel and the exposure to price comparisons. the pricing policy of a multi-channel retailer encounters specific difficulties: the global price transparency on the internet, the specific cost structures of the store and the online channel, hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  7  the existence of specific offers and the different means of payment render it difficult to apply a consistent pricing policy across all channels. especially the price transparency makes it difficult for a retailer to offer different prices for the same product on different sales channels. service, store pick-up and return a multi-channel service offer can be composed of special delivery options (delivery speed, delivery timing, information on order status), the exchange policy, return policy, refunding, after sales service, payment options and consumer credits. multi-channel retailers can offer either to deliver the order to the customer\\'s home or to let the customer pick-up the order in one of the stores. this service allows the customer to pick up the order whenever he likes, even sooner than with home delivery.2 allowing customers in-store return or exchange can avoid the cost and time of returning via mail. at the same time, this offers an important possibility for the retailer to create a personal contact between the client and the sales personnel to increase customer loyalty and to generate additional sales. personnel the sales personnel play a decisive role in stores. they welcome clients, provide counsel and advice and can influence sales. their behavior and attitude contribute in an important way to the atmosphere and ambiance of the store and its concept.  this important parameter in a store is irrelevant in a pure online channel, except for telephone hotline contacts or the delivery service personnel. in a multi-channel strategy, however, the store personnel have to be able to orient and counsel the client using different channels. it is very important for the client not to perceive any differences or barriers between the channels.  operational challenges of multi-channel retailing in general, the operational organization of a retailer is mainly focused on efficient store replenishment, lowering costs and shortening the product turnover time.                                                  2 in case of unavailable items, the retailer can chose to send the missing items directly to the customer and only reserve the available items in the store for pick-up. in this case, the customer experience will be negative, as the customer\\'s decision to pick up his order in the store can\\'t be fulfilled.   hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  8  to offer an online channel to its customers, a retailer has to be able to manage its operations in a very different way from its physical store activity. e-fulfillment may be considered as one of the most expensive and critical operations of internet retailers (de koster, 2002), logistics and stock management becoming core competencies (benghozi, 2001). keeping stock of a high number of different references, making it available, picking and packing, sending and delivering quickly at a low cost are the numerous constraints to respect. in the following, we will present and discuss the main operational issues, which are decisive for the overall performance of the multi-channel retailing. product availability product availability is one of the most important parameters for customer satisfaction (browne, 2009). a store customer usually can compare the products present in the store. availability is indicated through the simple presence of a product in the store shelve. a customer can ask the sales personnel if there is any stock of the product or when it will be available again. an online client needs to have all this information indicated on the website together with the product information. the online channel offers the possibility to display the remaining stock of a chosen product, or even, in a multi-channel context, the remaining stock and the location of the store where the product is available for testing, purchasing or withdrawal. displaying the availability of products or the delay of their replacement is an important marketing tool impacting the sales and influencing customer satisfaction.  stock keeping stores usually receive deliveries either directly from the manufacturer or from one or several logistics platforms with either warehousing or cross-docking function. as online orders may consist of different products, composing the orders from different warehouse locations may prove to be difficult and inefficient in terms of cost and delivery time. a central warehouse and fulfillment center may therefore, at a first view, be more adapted to the online channel. however, multi-channel retailers may as well pick the items for an online order directly in the stores. for an online order, the retailer has some flexibility where from he delivers the products to his customers, as he can use multiple stock locations and therefore offer a wider product range than the one contained in a single warehouse, as multiple channels may share their hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  9  inventories. in-store inventories can therefore be available for online customers\\' orders (agatz et al, 2008). centralizing stock allows easier monitoring of the stock levels for different products. if a retailer is serving its online clients (totally or partially) from stock in the stores, the overall stock level on these different locations is difficult to monitor. this is the same problem for multi-channel retailers who offer the possibility to their customers to order online and withdraw the product in a nearby store. as information on product availability is a crucial parameter for the customers buying decision, the accuracy of the stock level information is very important. order taking and fulfillment in an online channel, the customer enters the type and number of products he wants to acquire and enters the payment information (usually done by credit cards), the online channel therefore becomes a self-service channel (falk et al, 2007). all this information entered by the customer triggers the order preparation and fulfillment process. retailers once delivering their stores from centralized distribution centers (often with complete boxes or pallets) have to re-think the way orders are prepared, as their organizations are not designed for small individual customers\\' orders. they must therefore be reorganized to treat these orders (de koster, 2002), implementing a process of single item picking and packing. as mentioned above, another option for the retailer is to pick the items in the stores, where the products are available on the shelves, and to prepare the order in the shops. furthermore, orders may be consolidated from multiple stock locations (for example from a warehouse and a store), which needs a specific process. the more complex the fulfilment process is organized, the more difficult it becomes to respect the quality and efficiency of this process. delivery to the customer besides the availability of the product, the different delivery options for a product are an important parameter for the online channel client. different delivery service levels offered like delivery in 24 hours, delivery to a pick-up point, national post service etc. are becoming a product differentiation factor of the retailer. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  10  delivery to the customers\\' homes, which is a distinctive element of an online channel, implies to deal with cost and organizational issues. the usually small transactions have to be managed and delivered in an efficient way, while respecting the promised delivery timing. the costs of the home delivery can be totally or partially paid by the customer. this becomes an important parameter of choice for the client, as no direct delivery costs appear in the store channel. on the other hand, the costs of delivery can be used as a marketing tool for special offers (\"your next order free of charge\") or minimum order amounts (\"delivery free of charge for every order above 100 euros\"). delivery becomes therefore a service parameter, a price parameter and a promotional parameter. reverse logistic store customers can usually see, touch and try the goods before purchasing. returns are limited and very often linked to an exchange of the product, where the returned product is put back into the shelves. defect products are reimbursed. as online customers cannot see, touch and try the products, online retailers usually offer good conditions for the customer to return the products they don\\'t like (due to legal and regulatory obligations, but as well as part of their customer service offer).  return handling must be quick in the eyes of the customers, either to get a product exchange or to get reimbursed and the customer account re-credited. the process must as well be efficient as it is a very manual process and impacts the stock management of the returned products (min et al, 2006). a physical store channel can be an easy way in the customer\\'s eyes to return the products. multi-channel fulfillment systems  to operate the multi-channel strategy, retailers have to set up a fulfillment system to deliver products to the customers. this fulfillment system, organizing the process from order intake to delivery to the customer, has to match the business model and to reply to the operational challenges. industry players are using different fulfillment systems, and several authors suggest typologies of fulfillment schemes, focusing on the locus of order preparation (de koster, 2002; durand, 2008). multi-channel retailing per se intends to offer the clients the choice where and how to order and where and how to get the products delivered. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  11  the major choice for the client is to shop in the store or shop online. if shopping online, the client can furthermore opt for delivery at home or pick up his products in one of the retailer\\'s stores.  the retailer has to set up a fulfillment system able to respect the client\\'s choice of the delivery mode, either by creating a new logistics infrastructure, or using the existing one, by adapting the existing processes. in order to be able to analyze the fulfillment systems from a customer expectation\\'s perspective, we decided to distinguish the fulfillment systems by the delivery option chosen by the customer: clients may either choose the direct home delivery for their purchases completed on the online channel or choose to pick up their purchased items in a physical store of the retailer. this in-store pick-up is a delivery option only multi-channel retailers can offer and which may be chosen to 30-40% of the customers at some multi-channel retailers (berman & thelen, 2004). a client going into a store in order to buy a product, searches, compares, picks the product out of the shelve and pays the product. single-channel store shoppers may therefore not be affected by the multi-channel fulfillment organization. 1. direct home delivery direct home delivery can be completed either by the retailer\\'s own delivery organization, a delivery logistics provider or via an external pick-up point network3. before entering in this \\'delivery pipeline\\', products have to be picked, prepared, packed and expedited, which can be done either in a central warehouse or distribution center, in a store, or in multiple locations (central warehouse and one or more stores).                                                   3 we consider a delivery via an external pick-up-point network (usually neighborhood shops linked to a network which offers the retreat of parcels for the clients of different retailers) like a home delivery, as the fulfillment process is quite identical, with a delivery of (sometimes pre-sorted) parcels to the pick-up point network\\'s injection hub. although this is influencing the ease of access, this way of delivery cannot provide a contact with the retailer as in his own store.  hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  12  1.1 direct delivery from central warehouse  picking, preparation and packing of ordered items can be done from a central warehouse stocking the products (figure 1.1). this central warehouse can either be a purpose-built entity to serve exclusively the online channel or the existing warehouse for the store operations (in which case the processes in the warehouse have to be adapted).  1.2 direct delivery from a store  picking, preparation and packing of the ordered items can be done inside a physical store out of the shelves. in this case, operators pick the products into a specific order preparation cart from the shelves and then pack and send the completed order to the customer (figure 1.2).   1.3 direct delivery after multi-stock consolidation  if the desired articles of an order are not available in one place, picking of the ordered items has to be done in a central warehouse as well as inside a physical store from the shelves. the picked items have then to be consolidated, prepared and packed in one site (figure 1.3). in some cases, the multichannel  figure 1.1: direct delivery from central warehouse figure 1.2: direct delivery from a store figure 1.3: direct delivery after multi-stock consolidation hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  13  retailer may opt for sending the order in two different parcels, to avoid the costs and delay of the consolidation.  2 client pick-up in the store a customer ordering online may choose to pick up his products in one of the retailer\\'s stores. in this case, products have to be picked, prepared, packed and kept ready for pick-up in the store. 2.1 direct in-store order preparation  if all the products of the customer\\'s order are available in the store chosen by the customer to pick-up, the picking, preparation and packing of the order can be done immediately in the store (figure 2.1).     2.2 in-store order consolidation from multiple stocks  if some of the products of the customer\\'s order are not available in the store chosen by the customer for pick-up, the unavailable items must be ordered from the central warehouse (or other stores) to complete the order. the preparation and packing of the order can be done only after consolidation of all items in the store (figure 2.2). (a specific case of this in-store order consolidation can be a complete order  preparation in a central warehouse sent to the store only to be picked up by the customer, without further adding any product in the store).  figure 2.1: direct in-store order-preparation figure 2.2: in-store order consolidation from multiple stocks hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  14  the analysis framework in this part, we will first determine the parameters to integrate in our proposed framework. we then will apply this framework to the five abovementioned fulfillment systems and discuss the results. we will conclude this part discussing the limitations of the framework, suggestions for further research and managerial implications.  customer expectations and economic performance having analyzed the main strategy factors and operational challenges, and identified the five major fulfillment systems, we now have to determine the parameters to include into our proposed framework in order to evaluate these fulfillment systems. the different fulfillment systems lead to different levels of complexity, of costs and of product availability and therefore different levels of customer satisfaction and economic performance. to explore how a fulfillment system fits a given business model, we have to evaluate the overall performance of the different multi-channel fulfillment systems, combining the two angles of analysis:  on the one hand, we analyze to which extend a given fulfillment system is able to meet the customer expectations. on the other hand, we analyze the economic performance of each model. in our proposed framework, we will confront the different fulfillment systems to several parameters which are relevant for the customer expectations and the economic performance. the fulfillment systems may be considered as the independent variables of our analysis, whereas the different parameters of our framework represent the dependent variables. the identification of these parameters results from the exploration of the main strategy elements and operational challenges. concerning the economic performances of fulfillment, we propose to assess different dimensions of the overall fulfillment efficiency, combining widely used indicators to describe logistics and fulfillment performances (e.g. in agatz et al, 2008): ‐  stock efficiency (indicating reliable sales forecasts and optimized product replenishment to reduce stock-risk, capability of monitoring stock levels across different stock locations and the capability of balancing stock between different locations) ‐  picking efficiency (indicating efficient organization of stock and picking zones for picking and order preparation) hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  15  ‐  delivery cost efficiency (indicating the total cost of delivery from the stock(s) to the customers\\' home or to the desired store for pick-up) ‐  channel organization efficiency (indicating the information exchange between sales channels and real time availability of data) ‐  fulfillment infrastructure costs (indicating the necessary investments, rents or outsourcing costs for the fulfillment infrastructure) ‐  return handling efficiency (indicating the speed and quality of the return handling process, from product reception to exchange or reimbursement for the client)  analysis in the first part of this paper suggests three parameters indicating the customer expectations: ‐  product availability (indicating the availability of the desired products) ‐  speed of delivery (indicating the time between the order placement and the reception of the products by the customers) ‐  ease of access and return of products (indicating the ease for a client either to get the products delivered/to pick them up or to return/exchange the products received) in order to assess more precisely how a fulfillment system corresponds to the customer expectations, we completed these parameters with parameters from the servqual framework, developed by parasuraman et al (1988) to measure service quality. nevertheless, this traditional service quality may not be applicable in an online environment (parasuraman et al, 2005). bressolles (2006) developed the netqual framework to specifically assess electronic service quality.  as multi-channel retailing provides both \\'traditional\\' and \\'online\\' service experiences, we have to combine these two approaches in order to identify all the relevant dimensions to customer expectations and retain only those which may be directly impacted by the fulfilment model.  therefore, we selected the following dimensions out of the servqual and netqual scales for our analysis: ‐  quality and quantity of information ( netqual) (indicating the availability and correctness of the information provided in terms of product availability, stock level, delivery times etc. either on the website or in the stores)  hal-00560956, version 1 -

31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  17  using a centralized stock provides the highest chance to have the right information available (score: 2), whereas an order preparation from stores induces the problem of obtaining the right information on the store stock level (score: 1). if the order preparation has to be completed on several stock locations (central warehouse and stores), it is very difficult to obtain correct information and the quality of information may be low (score: 0). reliability and respect of commitments customers expect retailers to keep their promises, especially in terms of delivery time and delivery service. central warehouse order preparation should facilitate this, as the quality of information is high and the fulfillment process can be optimized (score: 2). order preparation in the stores suffers from difficulties in keeping a real-time stock level of all the products. therefore, store preparation may guarantee only a medium level of reliability and respect of commitments (score: 1), whereas multi-stock order preparation may only provide a low level (score: 0).  offer customers expect to find the offer they expect on every channel, a large or narrow product range with the appropriate depth of assortment. the retailer has to make sure to be able to offer the products customers expect on every channel. order fulfillment at a central warehouse or from multiple stocks should be capable to provide the entire range of the products (both score: 2), order preparation at the store is limited to the only product assortment in stock at the store (score: 0). product availability the customer expects that the products he intends to buy are available in the channel he desires to use. a central warehouse order preparation may provide only a medium level of product availability (score: 1) compared to the other options, as the availability depends on the stock keeping and forecasting precision of this single warehouse. stores can only guarantee a low level of product availability because of the small number of stock for every referenced product and the continuous buying from customers in the store (score: 0).  multi-stock order preparation may use the stock of different entities (stores and central warehouse) and therefore guarantee a very high level of product availability (score: 2), especially in case of a high number of articles per customer order. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  18  speed of delivery customers usually expect a rapid delivery of the products they bought and to be informed about the delivery timing. retailers therefore have to implement a fast and reliable delivery process, which may imply an external delivery service provider. a central warehouse usually needs to bridge the distance to the final customer, which may be long and therefore time-consuming. a medium level of speed of delivery may therefore be guaranteed (score: 1). as stores are closer to the final customer, the speed of delivery can be high when orders are prepared in the store (score: 2). orders prepared from multiple stock locations need a long time to be consolidated and can therefore only provide a low relative delivery speed (score: 0). ease of access and return of products customers expect easy access to the retailer to either pick up the products ordered or to return or exchange a product in case of dissatisfaction. home delivery from a central warehouse may make returns and exchange difficult for customers (score: 0), who have to use a postal service for returning the products (except in the case the retailer owns a quite dense network of stores and the store channel is fully integrated to handle returns and exchange from the online channel). order preparation in the store is usually done in the store closest to the customer. this store is therefore easy to access for the customer (score: 2). multi-stock preparation can only provide a medium level of ease of access and return (score: 1). although the customer can return a product to the closest store, exchange can be impossible if the products to be exchanged are only available at another stock location. assurance the customers expect competent and friendly personnel in the store for buying, picking up their orders, return or exchange. the same expectation may apply for the personnel on telephone customer hotlines or the delivery personnel. these functions being very often outsourced (especially the latter), retailers have to focus on their own sales personnel and make sure they provide the level of assurance the customer is expecting by providing the same information to all channels. the assurance of the personnel can only be provided in the case of order pick-up of the customer in the stores (score: 2; other option scores: 0). hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  19  stock efficiency for the retailer, the efficiency of stock management is crucial for numerous reasons. stock keeping and monitoring of stock levels, balancing between different stock locations and the forecasting of sales and product reorders influence the availability of the products and therefore the sales. efficient stock handling is as well an important cost element. central stock management can provide a high level of efficiency (score: 2), whereas a store can only provide a medium efficiency (score: 1) because of the low number of products per article and the continuous stock movement due to customers purchases out of the shelves. the handling of multiple stocks in the fulfillment process is the least efficient (score: 0). picking efficiency the picking of products out of stock to prepare the customer\\'s order is the key process of the overall fulfillment process, representing a very important part of the warehouse operating costs. this process is nevertheless transparent to the customer. a central warehouse can be organized in a way to optimize the picking process by planning and reducing the way picking operators have to go during the process (score: 2). depending on the volumes and the type of articles, it is possible to split the stock for whole cartons or open cartons picking or separate zones for stocking and picking. this optimization cannot be provided in a store or in multiple stock sites (scores: 0). stores\\' layouts and product locations are planned to make the customer spend the maximum time in the store and not to optimize the picking (de koster, 2002). delivery cost efficiency customers expect to pay the lowest extra cost possible for the delivery of their online orders and the retailer has to reduce the overall cost of the delivery. delivery of orders prepared in a central warehouse has always to include the transport to the customer\\'s home and therefore only achieve a medium efficiency (score: 1) compared to the delivery from a store (score: 2), where the distance to the final customer is short. pick-up by the customer from the store where the order was prepared is the less costly way of delivery for the retailer. any delivery from an order prepared in multiple stock locations (for home delivery or to a store for pick-up) is least efficient (score: 0), as the consolidation process of the order implies multiple costs of handling and transportation. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  20  channel organization efficiency as stated above, customers want to be able to use different channels simultaneously. a retailer has therefore to manage all the channels in an integrated manner.  preparing orders for home delivery from a central warehouse is the simplest and most efficient organization (score: 2). order preparation in the store involves the online and the store channel in the fulfillment process, therefore adding a level of complexity (score: 1). multi-stock preparation adds further complexity, being therefore the most difficult solution to achieve an efficient channel organization (score: 0). fulfillment infrastructure costs the fulfillment process may generate important investment costs, when a specific site is built as the stock and the distribution center, or if the design and the organization of an existing facility have to be modified. renting or outsourcing this infrastructure generates additional costs as well. a central warehouse order preparation generates a high infrastructure cost (score: 0), whereas the store preparation generates the lowest additional infrastructure costs (score: 2). order preparation from multiple stocks may generate medium additional infrastructure costs (score: 1) to organize the consolidation of the orders. return handling efficiency customers expect their returns to be processed quickly, to receive an exchange product or to get reimbursed the purchasing price. the retailer must therefore provide a quick and efficient return handling process. a central warehouse enables creation of optimized return processing (score: 2) to check the returns, repack and restock them and send the exchange items to the customers. multi-stock fulfillment can only provide a lower rate of return efficiency (score: 1), as the returned items arrive in different locations and the exchange items may only be available on different stock locations. for a store it is very difficult to offer an optimized return process (score: 0), especially when returned products are not part of the store\\'s product offer.  we can therefore summarize the impacts of the different fulfillment systems on the different parameters as follows (figure 3):  hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  21  figure 3: the analysis framework   home delivery  customer store pick-up fulfillment  system  1.1 1.2 1.3 2.1 2.2  prepared  in central warehouse prepared in store prepared in multiple stocks prepared in store prepared in multiple stocks customer expectations       quality and quantity of information  high (2)  medium (1)  low (0)  medium (1)  low (0) reliability and respect of commitments  high (2)  medium (1)  low (0)  medium (1)  low (0) offer  medium (1)  low (0)  high (2)  low (0)  high (2) product availability  medium (1)  low (0)  high (2)  low (0)  high (2) speed of delivery  medium (1)  high (2)  low (0)  high (2)  low (0) ease of access and return of products  low (0)  high (2)  medium (1)  high (2)  medium (1) assurance  low (0)  low (0)  low (0)  high (2)  high (2)        economic performance       stock efficiency  high (2)  medium (1)  low (0)  medium (1)  low (0) picking efficiency   high (2)  low (0)  low (0)  low (0)  low (0) delivery cost efficiency  medium (1)  high (2)  low (0)  high (2)  low (0) channel organization efficiency  high (2)  medium (1)  low (0)  medium (1)  low (0) fulfillment infrastructure costs efficiency low (0)  high (2)  medium (1)  high (2)  medium (1) return handling efficiency  high (2)  low (0)  medium (1)  low (0)  medium (1)        total score customer expectations 7 6 5 8 7 total score economic performance 9 6 2 6 2 total 16 12  7  14  9   this indicates several results: - home delivery from a central warehouse (system 1.1) is the fulfillment system best meeting the combination of the two dimensions customer expectations and economic performance, providing a total score of 16. this system provides the highest score in economic performance (9) and the second highest score in customer expectations (7). - customer pick-up after preparation in the store (system 2.1) provides the highest score in customer expectation (8) and a medium score in economic performance (6). the overall performance of this system is second best (total score of 14). - home delivery after store preparation (system 1.2) provides medium scores in customer expectations (6) and economic performance (6), ranking third best in the overall score (12).  - any fulfillment system implying the order preparation out of multiple stocks appears to be less efficient: if the order is picked up by the customer (system 2.2), the total score is 9, if the hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  22  order is delivered at home (system 1.3), the total score is only 7. in terms of economic performance, these two systems provide the lowest score (2). - economic performances of order preparation in the store or from multiple stocks are identical for both home delivery or in-store pick up by the customer. the difference in customer expectations (difference of 2) results from the possibility to have a personal contact with the customer, therefore responding to the customer expectation of \\'assurance\\', which can only be provided in a store. discussion, managerial implications and research avenues  the qualitative analysis of the different fulfillment systems and their impact on customer expectations and economic performance reveals that different fulfillment systems can provide high overall performance levels in terms of customer expectations and economic performance. the framework shows that orders for home delivery prepared in a central warehouse present only a slightly higher overall performance than an order prepared in a store for customer store-pick-up. a retailer has to assess the importance of each of the analyzed parameters for his specific retail mix and to optimize the trade-offs between channel fulfillment synergies and specific needs on different channels. depending on the product mix between food and non-food products, the width of product assortment and the characteristics of the existing store network, specific solutions may be more appropriate than others to fit with a specific business model. whereas proximity to customers is best achieved through a store network, stores add complexity on different levels in the fulfillment process which affect timing, costs and reliability. multi-stock consolidation seems to be always by far the less efficient model, regarding the customer expectations and the economic performance. this corresponds to the three initially mentioned multi-channel retailers: fnac abandoned the multi-stock preparation and completely integrated their fulfillment for the different channels, and neither tesco nor monoprix apply a multi-stock solution, whilst optimizing the in-store order preparation. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  23  our proposed framework could prove useful for multi-channel retailers in various ways: it provides a tool to evaluate the chosen fulfillment system and therefore identifying improvement potentials on specific parameters. it could also provide helpful to measure customer satisfaction. moreover, it should clearly be useful in anticipating the needs for fulfillment systems when planning to implement a multi-channel strategy. the proposed qualitative framework should be further validated by conducting supplementary empirical analysis, although it may be difficult to compare economic performances and customer expectations of different fulfillment systems in a same company. another difficulty may be to isolate the impacts of the supply chain from other impacts (marketing, pricing, product policy etc.). a limitation of our framework is the fact that it does not assess the interdependencies between the different dependent parameters, but only focuses on one major impact at a time. a first step to further back this framework could be to conduct a dynamic analysis through a simulation, testing values for the different parameters of the analysis framework. research could aim to find evidence if there is an \\'optimum\\' fulfillment system for every multi-channel retailer. such an optimal model could be defined depending on different independent variables like product assortment, average number of items per shopping basket, value of products, product characteristics, degree of channel integration etc. this would also include an analysis of the trade-off between cost- and customer service level optimization. such a research could as well reveal that there is no optimum model, but just a set of independent and non stabilized models evolving quickly as the retailers\\' strategy mix evolves.   acknowledgement  the work on this paper was partially supported by the innovation and regulation chair of orange, ecole polytechnique, telecom paris. hal-00560956, version 1 -

recently disrupted by developments in e-commerce and mobile technologies. the result has been the emergence of omni-channel retailing. within the reality of this new retail environment, it has been proposed that retailers should develop the necessary capabilities to fulfill consumer demand from anywhere – the store, the distribution center, or via drop-shipping from a supplier – which leads to the emergence of new operational complexities and challenges in the retail supply chain. in light of the growing popularity of these new fulfillment capabilities, it is important to not only consider the financial returns they provide to retailers, but also the potential impacts on the upstream supply chain. moreover, omni-channel operations will allow retailers to offer new fulfillment services to consumers, such as cross-channel returns or in-store pick-ups, ultimately resulting in new supply chain service outputs in the consumer market. thus, the aim of this dissertation is to investigate and obtain a holistic understanding of the importance and impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations for successful retail supply chain management. this will be done by considering three different echelons in the supply chain, (retailer, supplier, and consumer), and investigating how emerging strategies in omni-channel fulfillment impact all three. using the theoretical underpinning of ambidexterity, essay 1 investigates how retailers manage their investments and developments pertaining to existing and new fulfillment operations, and how that may lead to improvements in a retailer\\'s operational and financial performance. to address this research question a structured content analysis in combination with secondary financial data was conducted. to explore how retail omni-channel fulfillment operations impact upstream supply chain members a qualitative research approach was executed in essay 2 using the case study methodology. essay 3 employs a series of experimental studies to explore how retail omni-channel fulfillment operations can be used to recover from a stockout. using equity theory, this essay investigates how, in the case of a stockout, different attributes of omni-channel service operations may impact consumer satisfaction and their evaluation of a retailer\\'s physical distribution service quality (pdsq).              table of

characterized by a clear division between brick-and-mortar and non-brick-and-mortar retailers, experienced a recent shift by the emergence of e-commerce and mobile technologies (brynjolfsson, hu, and rahman 2013; rigby 2011). in this new retail environment, the clear division between physical and digital retail channels has been slowly diminishing. now, a new integrated omni-channel retail environment (brynjolfsson et al. 2013) with multiple touch-points (wallace et al. 2004) and innovative services, such as in-store pick up (vishwanath and mulvin 2001) and the ability to return online purchases at a physical store is emerging (bendoly et al. 2005). however, retailers offering consumers with these innovative fulfillment services spanning multiple channels are likely to also face difficulties and challenges in managing and executing their retail supply chain operations in an efficient and effective manner. while some retailers, such as nordstrom, apple, or walmart for instance, excel with their omni-channel fulfillment operations, the reality is that the majority of retailers struggle with the realization and management of their omni-channel fulfillment operations (forrester research, inc. 2014). omni-channel fulfillment operations are those activities that span from consumers placing orders from multiple touch points (i.e. store, website, mobile device) to retailers fulfilling those orders from multiple touch points (i.e. store, dc, or manufacturer), ultimately resulting in customer satisfaction (pyke et al. 2001; strang 2013). research suggests that retailers with effective omni-channel retail service operations management are able to gain a competitive advantage (burke 2002; weinberg et al. 2007). however, the majority of the research on retail operations focuses on investigating operations within a single channel, neglecting the emerging operational complexity of omni-channel retailing (agatz et al. 2008). 2  thus, important and interesting research questions pertaining to omni-channel fulfillment operations are still unanswered and warrant further exploration.   apple, for example, became a leading omni-channel retailer by taking advantage of its already established fulfillment operations of its brick-and-mortar and online channel through integrating the respective channel operations to develop and establish new fulfillment operations opportunities. this anecdotal evidence of apple advocates the importance of adopting new fulfillment operations for retailers to be successful within the new reality of omni-channel retailing. it is proposed that retailers developing the necessary capabilities to fulfill consumer demand from anywhere – the store, the distribution center, or via drop-shipping from a supplier (strang 2013) – is leading to the emergence of new operational complexities and challenges in the retail supply chain.  while these new fulfillment operations enable retailers to offer new services to consumers, such as cross-channel returns or in-store pick-ups (vishwanath and mulvin 2001), they might also have significant impacts on the upstream supply chain as well. however, current research falls short in terms of considering the potential impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations on different echelons in the supply chain. thus, the aim of this dissertation is to investigate and obtain a more holistic understanding of the importance and impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations for successful retail supply chain management by considering three different echelons in the supply chain. three individual studies implementing various methodological approaches were conducted that considered the potential impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations at the supplier, the retailer, and the consumer level. figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the three essays. the following research questions are addressed in this dissertation: 3  (1) how do retail omni-channel fulfillment operations impact retail firm performance? (2) how do retail omni-channel fulfillment operations impact the upstream supply chain? (3) how do retail omni-channel fulfillment operations impact consumer service perceptions?  figure 1: dissertation overview foundational literature review retail supply chain management retail supply chain management research spans across a wide range of specific research areas, but predominantly focuses on investigating the potential impacts of operational improvements on retail supply chain performance (mentzer et al. 2000). over the last decade more retail research emerged focusing on the strategic importance of the retailer (randall et al. 2011) and even consumers in retail supply chain management (e.g. rao et al. 2014; rao et al. 4  2011). extant literature can be broadly categorized into three areas that address: forecasting, inventory management and the bullwhip effect, and retail operations. forecasting literature exploring forecasting in supply chain management can be segmented into three literature streams. the first stream focuses on how forecasting accuracy can be improved (e.g. williams and waller 2010; williams and waller 2011). for example, research in this stream suggests that suppliers may be able to improve their forecast accuracy by using point-of-sale data rather than using a retailer\\'s order history to develop forecasts (williams and waller 2010; williams and waller 2011). the second stream explores how forecasting impacts operational performance (e.g. aviv 2007). for instance, it is suggested that suppliers and buyers can achieve significant supply chain performance improvements when implementing a collaborative forecasting approach in comparison to each echelon developing an individual forecast (e.g. aviv 2001; cachon and lariviere 2001). the third stream of research integrates the importance of managerial decision making into forecasting accuracy (carbone and gorr 1985; kremer et al. 2011). this body of work suggests that human judgment is an important factor that should be considered when developing forecasts. for example, kremer et al. (2011) showed that managers are likely to overreact to forecast errors in stable environments leading to poorer forecasting performance.  inventory management and bullwhip effect another body of literature within the area of retail supply chain management considers inventory management and the bullwhip effect. the bullwhip effect is the amplified variability in demand as one moves upstream in the supply chain (lee et al. 1997). within that literature, 5  research primarily focuses on exploring the impact of inaccurate inventory records (e.g. dehoratius and raman 2008; kull et al. 2013) and the operational and behavioral causes of the bullwhip effect (e.g. lee et al. 1997; croson and donohue 2006). in general, research has shown that inventory record inaccuracy leads to poor retail performance. specifically, within a multi-channel retail setting, daily inventory record inaccuracy has been shown to increase inventory levels, while simultaneously decreasing service levels (kull et al. 2013). similarly, nachtmann et al. (2010) found evidence for lower service levels stemming from inaccurate inventory records. pertaining to the bullwhip effect, early research was specifically interested in exploring the operational causes that lead to the bullwhip effect (e.g. sterman 1989; lee et al. 1997). in addition to operational causes, behavioral causes, such as decision biases, have been of interest to retail supply chain management research. for example, croson and donohue (2006) found that managers constantly underweight the supply line (i.e. failure to account for past orders) inducing the bullwhip effect even after controlling for operational causes. however, some researchers failed to find evidence that the bullwhip effect  exists in retail supply chains (cachon et al. 2007).  retail operations a last major topic in retail supply chain management considers retail operations and specifically focuses on on-shelf availability (osa) (e.g. dehoratius and raman 2008; waller et al. 2010; ehrenthal and stölzle 2013). within this research domain two streams can be identified. the first stream emphasizes the causes of poor osa (e.g. ehrenthal and stölzle 2013; ettouzani et al. 2012) whereas the second stream focuses on consumer responses to out-of-stocks (zinn and liu 2001; zinn and liu 2008; peinkofer et al. 2015). this research 6  suggests that poor osa is primarily the result of operational inefficiencies within the supply chain (corsten and gruen 2003). furthermore, while poor osa leads to significant financial losses for retailers and suppliers, it also impacts consumers. the literature suggests that stockouts lead to consumer dissatisfaction and lowers repurchase intentions (pizzi and scarpi 2013; kim and lennon 2011). fulfillment operations research pertaining to omni-channel fulfillment operations is still in its infancy and the majority of the available papers are either analytical in nature or adopt simulation techniques. this body of literature primarily focuses on investigating the linkages between fulfillment operations and the potential cost trade-offs firms may face when implementing omni-channel fulfillment operations (e.g. bretthauer et al. 2010; alptekinoğlu and tang 2005).  while these important contributions should not be overlooked, the current focus of the extant research effectively ignores the impact that omni-channel fulfillment operations may have on supply chain members. thus, it might be necessary to gain a holistic understanding of the potential impacts, changes, and challenges by considering different echelons of the supply chain. within the realm of omni-channel retailing, operating and integrating multiple channels adds to a supply chain\\'s complexity but also provides members of a supply chain with new service opportunities and synergies (verhoef et al. 2012). this is particularly relevant within the context of fulfillment operations. for example, some companies now offer consumers the ability to order products online and pick them up in the store, or request they be delivered to their home or place of employment. given this change in the consumer environment, retailers will need to develop the capabilities required to fulfill consumer orders that are received and 7  satisfied simply from anywhere - whether it is from the store, the warehouse, or directly the supplier (strang 2013).   one common theme found across the fulfillment literature pertains to the different strategies that multi-channel retailers use. typically, retailers adding an additional  retail channel can either select to establish a separate fulfillment network or they can leverage their already existing  network (bendoly 2004). in the latter case, retailers could use their stores to also fulfill online demand. however, research shows that retailers should carefully evaluate based on various factors, such as that the percentage of online sales (bretthauer et al. 2010) for example, which stores to dedicate for simultaneous in store and online demand fulfillment since not all stores may be appropriate for online fulfillment operations (e.g. bretthauer et al. 2010; bendoly 2004; mahar et al. 2014). another possible option for retailers is to fulfill online demand using a distribution center. insofar as distribution cost might differ for each of these options, alptekinoğlu and tang (2005) develop a model and demonstrate that it is typically more beneficial to fulfill online demand from the store when the distribution costs for both options similar. a second stream of research pertaining to fulfillment operations focuses on the impact of drop-shipping in online retailing. drop-shipping is a fulfillment strategy where online orders are directly fulfilled by suppliers rather than drawing inventory from a retailer\\'s physical store or a distribution center (cheong et al. 2015). one major challenge associated with this fulfillment option has to do with the potential discrepancies in inventory information between retailers and drop-shippers. inventory record inaccuracies are a major driver of retail operation inefficiencies (kull et al. 2013; dehoratius and raman 2008). however, research shows that 8  these challenges can be mitigated by commitment-penalty contracts (gan et al. 2010) or by accounting for potential inventory errors (cheong et al. 2015). theoretical background essays one and two focus on the firm level; hence, an organizational theory is a suitable lens to inform these essays. insofar as it is important for suppliers and retailers to refine their current fulfillment operations while simultaneously developing new fulfillment operations to adapt to the changing environment, the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity is deemed appropriate for these two studies. essay three focuses on consumers more specifically and thus warrants a consumer level theory. since equity theory has been widely used to study consumer behavior and perceptions in the context of service recovery (e.g. roggeveen et al. 2012), equity theory is suitable to explore how omni-channel fulfillment operations impact consumer service perceptions.  ambidexterity rothaermel and alexandre (2009, 759) define ambidexterity as \"an individual\\'s ability to use both hands with equal ease\". applied to organizational management research, the ambidexterity concept has received interest from management scholars over the last decade (o\\'reilly and tushman 2013) and have given rise to a new research paradigm in the organizational theory literature (raisch and birkinshaw 2008). research suggests that specifically within dynamic environments successful firms are understood to be ambidextrous (junni et al. 2013) when they are capable of meeting current demand while at the same time being able to adapt to environmental (and subsequent demand) changes (duncan 1976; gibson and birkinshaw 2004; tushman and o\\'reilly 1996).  9  the concept of ambidexterity has been examined across various disciplines and contexts, such as organizational learning (e.g. march 1991; katila and ahuja 2002), innovation (e.g. tushman and o\\'reilly 1996; he and wong 2004), and most recently, operations management (e.g. blome et al. 2013; kristal et al. 2010). ambidexterity originated in the organizational learning literature (march 1991) and implies that in order to be successful, firms should meet current business demands (exploitation) while simultaneously adapting to environmental changes (exploration) (duncan 1976; gibson and birkinshaw 2004; tushman and o\\'reilly 1996). according to march (1991, 71) exploitation is defined as a firm\\'s activities that are characterized by, for example, refinement, efficiency, implementation, and execution, whereas exploitation is understood as a firm\\'s activities that include risk taking, experimentation, flexibility, discovery, and innovation to name a few.  while earlier research proposes that it is impossible for firms to achieve a simultaneous balance between exploitation and exploration (hannan and freeman 1977), march (1991) argues the contrary. march claims that it is of explicit necessity to a company\\'s survival that a balance between exploitation and exploration is maintained. focusing on only one activity, either exploitation or exploration, may actually be to a company\\'s disadvantage. literature suggests that companies solely focusing on exploitation may find themselves in a competency trap since these companies are unlikely to have the necessary capabilities in place to respond to environmental changes (levitt and march 1988). similarly, companies solely focusing on exploration may find themselves in a reiterative circle of search without any long-lasting outcomes (levinthal and march 1993). therefore the organizational research focus shifted from considering trade-offs between competing organizational activities, to adopting the 10  paradoxical view of aligning competing organizational activities simultaneously, thus giving rise to the concept of ambidexterity in management research (o\\'reilly and tushman 2013). operations and supply chain scholars recognize ambidexterity as a potential solution to overcome the trade-offs between operational efficiency and adaptability (e.g. kristal et al. 2010; patel et al. 2012). within the limited number of research manuscripts addressing ambidexterity three themes can be distinguished. first, some scholars use ambidexterity within the broader context of supply chain management (kristal et al. 2010; chandrasekaran et al. 2012). for example, kristal et al. (2010) showed that firms having an ambidextrous supply chain strategy is helpful in developing supply chain capabilities and competencies leading to increased firm performance. a second theme considers ambidexterity at an operational level. research suggest that operational ambidexterity is specifically important for companies operating under high uncertainty (patel et al. 2012). while the first two themes consider ambidexterity within an individual firm, the third theme investigates the potential impact of ambidexterity when spanning firm boundaries. research especially focused on how ambidextrous governance relates to firm performance (blome et al.  2013; chiu 2014). findings suggest that within supply chain management, contractual and relational partnerships should be viewed as complementary rather than trade-offs (blome et al. 2013).  equity theory equity theory (adams 1965) is an appropriate theoretical lens to study retail phenomena involving retailers and consumers. equity theory states that in an exchange relationship, one party will experience a feeling of injustice if their ratio of outcomes to inputs is perceivably lower than their exchange partner\\'s ratio of outcomes to inputs. for example, if a retailer and its consumers are in an exchange relationship and the retailer is unable to provide 11  the consumers with the products they desire, consumers are likely to experience inequity and dissatisfaction (oliver 1980) since they expected to be able to buy the product. however, equity can be restored by altering either the consumer\\'s inputs or outputs. for example, a retailer may offer customers a similar product (to the one they are out of), which in turn may increase the consumer\\'s output, thereby mitigating the feeling of injustice leading to consumer satisfaction (roggeveen et al. 2012) and a positive attitude (oliver 1980).   while equity theory originally only considered the dimension of distributive justice, more recently it has been conceptualized by three dimensions: distributive, procedural, and interactional justice. distributive justice refers to an individual\\'s perception that the outcome of a process was fair (adams 1965; tax et al. 1998). procedural justice refers to an individual\\'s perception of whether the process and policies that led to the outcome of process are were fair (lind and tyler 1988; blodgett et al. 1997), and interactional justice refers to an individual\\'s perception of whether the interpersonal treatment during the process was fair (tax et al. 1998).  service recovery literature specifically draws on equity theory and conceptualizes equity as consisting of the three aforementioned dimensions. extant research has shown that all three justice dimensions are important when attempting to restore consumer satisfaction after a service failure has occurred (e.g. roggeveen et al. 2012). additionally, supply chain management researchers have used equity theory to investigate supply chain failures (rao et al. 2011; griffis et al. 2012). therefore, the use of equity theory to study how omni-channel fulfillment operations impact consumer service perceptions is appropriate.    12  structure of the dissertation three individual essays with different methodological approaches were conducted to address the research questions outlined in the introduction. essay one addresses the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations at the retailer level using secondary data. essay two investigates the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations on upstream supply chain members. for this study a qualitative approach is used. lastly, essay three focuses on the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations at the consumer level by implementing a series of experimental studies. essay one using the theoretical underpinning of ambidexterity, this essay explores how retailers manage and prioritize their investments and developments pertaining to exploratory and exploitative fulfillment operations and how those may lead to improvements in a retailer\\'s operational and financial performance. to address how omni-channel fulfillment operations are related to retail firm performance, a combination of secondary data of the retail industry are used. using secondary data overcomes several shortcomings of other methods, for example survey methods, which are associated with common method and key informant bias (roth 2007; gattiker and parente 2007). data was collected from various secondary data sources. first, compustat data was used to collect firm-level financial measures for publicly traded retailers. second, press releases from the lexis-nexis database were used to collect data pertaining to a retailer\\'s announcement of fulfillment operations. this approach is in line with prior research 13  implementing a similar research approach (e.g. hofer et al.  2012; uotila et al. 2009; tate et al. 2010).  the search within lexis-nexis is limited to the archives of the business wire and pr newswire and all press releases referring to a retailer\\'s omni-channel fulfillment operations will be included in our analysis. once all press releases were collected, the archival texts were analyzed using atlas.ti to extract data to create our independent variables. structural content analysis is an appropriate tool for quantitative content analysis (tangpong 2011) and has been used in prior supply chain and operations research (e.g. hofer et al. 2012). this approach is in line with previous research using press releases and structural content analyses to construct the independent variables of interest (uotila et al. 2009).  essay two  a qualitative approach is suitable for exploration and theory building (charmaz 2006). to explore how a retailer\\'s omni-channel fulfillment operations impact upstream supply chain members a qualitative research approach is employed using a case study design (yin 2009). by starting the research process with examining the potential impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations on upstream supply chain members in depth, a solid understanding of the underlying assumptions and processes is achieved. two case studies consisting of in-depth interviews and on-site visits were conducted. the emerging findings were triangulated with data from online news articles. this study explores the new role of suppliers within omni-channel retailing and how suppliers achieve operational ambidexterity. interviews were professionally transcribed and analyzed using initial and focused coding procedures following charmaz (2006). adopting a qualitative research approach resulted in a solid theoretical model deeply grounded in the data (charmaz 2006). 14  essay three the aim of this essay is to explore how omni-channel fulfillment operations can be used to recover from a stockout. this essay investigates how, in the case of a stockout, different attributes (e.g. convenience and speed) of omni-channel fulfillment operations may impact consumer satisfaction and their evaluation of a retailer\\'s physical distribution service quality (pdsq). using equity theory, a conceptual framework was developed and a series of experimental studies conducted to address the aforementioned research question. experimental methods are used to isolate the causal effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable(s) of interest (tokar 2010) and to test for potential mediators and moderators (knemeyer and naylor 2011). to ensure that only the variables of interest are manipulated and to rule out potential confounds, this method involves the careful development of experimental manipulations through extensive pretesting (perdue and summers 1986; knemeyer and naylor 2011). the first study manipulated two attributes related to omni-channel fulfillment: convenience, which refers to where a product is shipped to (i.e. the store or the consumer\\'s home) and speed, which accounts for when a product will be delivered (i.e. next day or in 9 days). building on the first study, the second study specifically investigated the underlying theoretical mechanism, which may led to restoration of positive consumer perceptions after a stockout occurred. study 3 introduced purchase criticality as an important contextual factor to investigate whether the relationships found in study 1 and study 2 holds in different consumer\\'s shopping context. research on consumer responses to out-of-stocks has shown that it is important to consider whether a consumer feels he or she truly \"needs\" a product or not, since this contextual factor might alternate the expected relationships (zinn and liu 2001).  15  following prior experimental work in the supply chain management field (e.g. esper et al. 2003), the series of experiments is based on a hypothetical shopping scenario where only the variables of interest vary between treatment groups. careful development of the experimental shopping scenario, following the guidelines of rungtusanatham et al. (2011), ensured the validity of the shopping scenario. similarly, extensive pretesting ensured the validity of the experimental manipulations (perdue and summers 1986). the hypothetical shopping scenario asked participants to imagine themselves in a particular shopping situation and asked them to answer a short survey, wherein the responses served as the dependent variables of interest. for the pretest, a student sample was used. students are an acceptable sample for experimental research in supply chain management research (thomas 2011), insofar as students are also consumers (kardes 1996). the final data wwre collected via amazon mechanical turk (mturk), a national online consumer panel. mturk has been deemed an acceptable source to recruit participants for experimental research (knemeyer and naylor 2011; goodman et al. 2013).  contributions and implications  the current fulfillment operations literature primarily employs analytical models to investigate the impact of various fulfillment strategies on cost trade-offs. consequently, the extant literature provides only limited insights into the impact of fulfillment operations and neglects the potential effects on other important retail supply chain performance measures. this dissertation overcomes these limitations by exploring the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations on three different echelons in the supply chain. thus, this dissertation provides a holistic view of how omni-channel fulfillment operations affect retail operations and supply chain management, more generally. 16  contributions and implications of essay one essay one of this dissertation highlights the strategic importance of omni-channel fulfillment operations for retailers\\' performance outcomes. specifically, this research shows that retailers in the general merchandise and apparel segment achieve significant financial performance improvements due to operational ambidexterity. by focusing on the importance of developing ambidexterity in terms of fulfillment operations to achieve superior operational and financial performance outcomes, this dissertation explicates the impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations, beyond just a retailer\\'s cost structure. this is of particular interest, insofar as some companies fail to report any performance enhancements despite conducting omni-channel fulfillment operations (pwc 2015). consequently, this research is able to explain why some companies experience superior performance outcomes due to omni-channel fulfillment operations and why others do not. such insights might enable mangers to evaluate their own companies and equip them with better understanding as to why their companies might not reach expected performance outcomes. it also highlights the importance for managers to develop ambidextrous fulfillment operations to succeed in the changing and volatile retail environment. moreover, by considering the impact of additional factors on the ambidexterity-performance relationship, this research explores boundary conditions and thus, also contributes to the theoretical understandings of ambidexterity. considering resource endowment as a potential moderator, this research shows that large as well as small retailers might benefit from developing ambidextrous fulfillment operations. managerially, the results inform mangers on whether, operational ambidexterity would be is a viable strategy to implement in order to achieve improved performance outcomes. 17  this research also contributes to the limited body of work on operational ambidexterity. ambidexterity is an important concept, which overcomes trade-offs that managers might experience in the operations management field. thus, this research provides further evidence of the positive relationship between operational ambidexterity and a firm\\'s operational and financial performance. in particular, this research uses longitudinal data providing further insights into the impact of operational ambidexterity over time to overcome the limitations of the current research, which relies heavily on cross-sectional data (e.g. patel et al. 2012). furthermore, by constructing an innovative data set and using a structured content analysis, this research specifically follows recent calls for more innovate research approaches (boyer and swink 2008) and the usage of content analyses for operations management research in particular (tangpong 2011). accordingly, essay one contributes to the general operations management literature by illustrating the suitability of this methodological approach for this discipline.  contributions and implications of essay two essay two of this dissertation explores how suppliers become operationally ambidextrous. specifically, considering drop-shipping as a new fulfillment option, suppliers might experience a disruption in their already established fulfillment operations, insofar as they now might also fulfill individual end-consumer orders. this research focuses on suppliers\\' operational ambidexterity by providing a detailed description of how suppliers actually achieve operational ambidexterity within the context of drop-shipping. it is suggested that within the context of drop-shipping, there is a cyclical nature of exploitation and exploration. this is especially important considering that the literature lacks a clear understanding on how companies can achieve ambidexterity (e.g adler et al. 1999; siggelkow and levinthal 2003). 18  thus, this research advances the theoretical understandings of operational ambidexterity. this research also provides managers with insights on how to become operationally ambidextrous. supply chain managers can use the findings of this study to benchmark them against their own company to investigate the factors needing adjustment in order to improve their operational ambidexterity. in addition, this research shifts the focus of drop-shipping research from a strategic perspective (the retailer) to a more tactical perspective (the supplier). in response, this research provides insight into the operational challenges (customizing, complying, and coordinating) and drivers (reacting, accepting, and penetrating) suppliers are facing within the current context of omni-channel retailing. contributions and implications of essay three essay three spans the research areas of operations and marketing by investigating how omni-channel fulfillment operations can impact consumer perceptions. this research specifically contributes to the growing literature stream associated with consumer issues in supply chain management, which advocates the importance of operations management to create end-consumer value (flint and mentzer 2006). specifically, this research highlights the importance of fulfillment operations for service recovery within an omni-channel retail environment. this research is important considering that in in an omni-channel retail environment fulfilment operations may play a new and important role in recovering from out-of-stocks and could help retailers \"save the sale.\" additionally, this research contributes to the literature that investigates how consumers respond to out-of-stocks. historically, this body of work has exclusively focused on exploring 19  consumer responses to out-of-stocks in a single channel setting (e.g. zinn and liu 2008; pizzi and scarpi 2013). however, with the emergence of omni-channel retailing, consumers have new options, in terms of their behavioral responses, when a stockout occurs. this research extends the current understandings of consumer responses to out-of-stocks by considering an omni-channel retail context. furthermore, given the shift towards an omni-channel retail environment, wherein consumers have increased expectations and immediate switching capabilities (brynjolfsson et al. 2013), it is essential for retail managers to understand consumer behavior and how consumers evaluate different fulfillment operations. this research highlights that a fast stockout recovery is essential for positive consumer perceptions. however, it is important to understand that not all recovery efforts will be evaluated by consumers equally. this research shows that the shopping context (purchase criticality) as an important effect on how consumers perceive different recovery attributes. managers may wish to gain an understanding of the recovery attributes that are most valued by consumers to increase consumer satisfaction and repurchase intentions. this research considers the attributes of convenience and speed. these attributes are evaluated considering the situational involvement of the consumer in the shopping process and thus provide further insights for managers. this research shows that consumers evaluate the attributes differently based on their situational involvement. thus, managers should adjust their recovery strategies according to consumer\\'s situational involvement to provide the most value and satisfaction to consumers. dissertation outline following the introduction in chapter one, chapter two focuses on how omni-channel fulfillment operations are related to a retailer\\'s performance. next, chapter three constitutes the 20  qualitative study, which explores operational ambidexterity within the drop-shipping context. chapter four consists of a series of experiments that investigate how omni-channel fulfillment operations impact service recovery after a stockout has occurred. lastly, chapter five will conclude this dissertation by summarizing the grand findings of this dissertation.  21  references  adams, j.s. 1965. \"inequity in social exchange.\" advances in

ambidexterity on retail firm performance                        30  introduction  in early 2013, macy\\'s announced that it would be dedicating an additional 200 stores by the end of the year for the purpose of fulfilling online orders (ryan 2014). now, macy\\'s is one of the leading retailers competing in the current retail landscape. by integrating their physical and electronic fulfillment operations (referred to as an omni-channel) (brynjolfsson et al. 2013), macy\\'s was able to gain more flexibility to efficiently and effectively fulfill consumer demand and address increasing consumer expectations. however, anecdotal evidence with regards to the effectiveness of omni-channels is mixed. while some retailers have reported performance improvements due to the implementation of omni-channel fulfillment operations (forrester research, inc. 2014), others failed to report any performance enhancements whatsoever (pwc 2015). because technological advancements are thought to disrupt and alter the traditional retail landscape (brynjolfsson et al. 2013; rigby 2011), it is pivotal to understand why some retailers might be able to succeed within this new omni-channel reality while others might not be able to thrive.  macy\\'s standing as one of the leading retailers in the u.s. is largely due to its emphasis on improving existing fulfillment operations while simultaneously developing new fulfillment services, such as online ordering and in-store pickup options (vishwanath and mulvin 2001). in particular, when retailers fulfill online customer orders from physical stores, it allows the retailer to leverage pre-established fulfillment operations (metters and walton 2007), while simultaneously employing new fulfillment services for consumers. this anecdotal evidence suggests that retailers may need to develop \"ambidextrous\" fulfillment operations to compete and survive within this new reality of omni-channel. using the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity (e.g. tushman and o\\'reilly 1996; raisch and birkinshaw 2008), this study 31  investigates how retailers manage and prioritize their investments and developments with regards to their fulfillment operations and how that may lead to improvements in a retailer\\'s operational and financial performance.  rothaermel and alexandre (2009, 759) define ambidexterity as an \"individual\\'s ability to use both hands with equal ease\". in the organizational management literature, ambidexterity is used to describe the concept of balancing existing activities (exploitation) and new activities (exploration) (march 1991). thus, the main premise of ambidexterity is that firms can achieve higher performance outcomes if they are able to balance activities pertaining to exploration and exploitation (march 1991). it is widely accepted within the management literature that firms will achieve higher performance outcomes if they are able to become \"ambidextrous\" (lubatkin 2006; he and wong 2004; junni et al. 2013). similarly, the operations management literature suggests that firms that are able to exhibit ambidexterity in their operational activities might be able to achieve superior performance outcomes (patel et al. 2012). alternatively, those companies which fail to establish a balance between their exploration and exploitation activities, might not achieve optimal performance outcomes. a company that focuses exclusively on exploitation may lack the necessary capabilities to respond appropriately to changes in the environment (levitt and march 1988). correspondingly, a company that focuses exclusively on exploration may find itself in an reiterative circle of search leading to no performance enhancements (levinthal and march 1993).  the majority of extant research exploring fulfillment operations uses analytical modeling to analyze the link between single and multi-channel fulfillment operations and estimate potential cost trade-offs (e.g. bretthauer et al. 2010; alptekinoğlu and tang 2005). this body of research is limited insofar as it lacks an in-depth exploration of this linkage 32  between fulfillment operation and firm performance. furthermore, a limited number of studies have developed empirical models to study the impact of fulfillment operations on operational (randall, netessine, and rudi 2006) and financial performance (xia and zhang 2010). however, research exploring the link between a retailer\\'s fulfillment operations and its operational and financial performance within an omni-channel retail context is still lacking.  this research will make several contributions to the operations and supply chain management literature. first, it empirically explores the potential benefits of ambidextrous fulfillment operations within the u.s. retail industry. prior research suggests that ambidexterity may be advantageous for firms to achieve higher performance outcomes, specifically within service industries (junni et al. 2013). furthermore, while the majority of operational ambidexterity research relies solely on survey data, this study uses a combination of data extracted from content analyses and financial information from compustat to overcome the limitations of using survey data, such as common method and key informant bias (roth 2007; gattiker and parente 2007). research implementing quantitative content analyses is limited in the operations management discipline (montabon et al. 2007), but remains an interesting and innovative approach to analysis, particularly in this field (tangpong 2011). thus, this research follows boyer and swink\\'s (2008) call to employ diversified data sources in operations management research and specifically addresses tangpong\\'s (2011) suggestion to use content analysis tools for operations management research. the remainder of this manuscript will first provide an overview of the fulfillment operations literature. next, the theoretical underpinnings and hypotheses will be presented following by an overview of the methodological approach and the results. the paper concludes with a discussion of the research findings and implications. 33  literature review   consolidating physical and electronic retail channels in order to achieve a seamless retail environment carries some operational challenges, specifically in terms of order fulfillment, insofar as this act essentially necessitates a redesign of the retail supply chain. the physical retail environment is characterized by central warehouses and distribution centers that deliver products by the truck-load to respective retail stores, where end-consumer demand is fulfilled (metters and walton 2007). in the electronic retail environment, retailers take a different approach and end-consumer demand is directly fulfilled from a central warehouse location (metters and walton 2007). with the advancement of omni-channel retailing, however, online orders may be fulfilled either by a central warehouse or a dedicated store(s), hence combining the benefits of both approaches and fostering synergy effects across channels (agatz et al. 2008). this is particularly advantageous for retailers, as their aim is ultimately to fulfill demand as efficiently as possible, be it by a store, distribution center, or manufacturer (strang 2013). nonetheless, this introduces new complexities to the retail supply chain and also impacts operations.  the more recent online fulfillment literature can be distinguished into two streams of research. the first stream focuses exclusively on online fulfillment operations (e.g. rabinovich 2005; netessine and rudi 2006; acimovic and graves 2015). internet retailers can fulfill end-consumer demand via their own inventory stocking locations, through an external supplier that directly fulfills end-consumer demand upon the retailer\\'s request (also known as drop-shipping), or by using a hybrid of these two strategies. the optimal fulfillment strategy for retailers depends on various external factors, such as drop-shipping mark-up, transportation costs (netessine and rudi 2006), market value, product popularity (bailey and rabinovich 34  2005), product variety, demand uncertainty, and firm age (randall et al. 2006), to name a few. for example, retailers using drop-shipping may optimize their profits by dividing incoming orders based on high and low priority (ayanso et al. 2006) and may achieve higher fulfillment performance due to emergency transshipments (rabinovich 2005) or inventory consolidation (rabinovich and evers 2003). the second stream considers fulfillment operations within a multi-channel context (i.e. retailers that operate physical stores and have an online presence). integrating physical and electronic channels allows retailers to offer new and different fulfillment services to end-consumers, such as online ordering and in-store pick up or return (vishwanath and mulvin 2001). accordingly, these new services also require retailers to rework their fulfillment strategies. for example, retailers may need to evaluate whether online demand should be fulfilled from a distribution center or from retail stores. research shows that a retailer can determine the optimal number of stores which handle online order fulfillment based on the percentage of online sales (bretthauer et al. 2010). thus, retailers can potentially decrease their costs by selecting only dedicated stores to offer new fulfillment services, such as online ordering and in-store pick up or return (mahar et al. 2014). still issues may occur; for example, fulfilling online demand from in-store inventory could lead to a lack of inventory availability in stores (bendoly 2004) and hence retailers could potentially face a loss in sales.  as was previously mentioned, the majority of the literature investigating fulfillment operations employs analytical research methods and focuses on optimizing cost trade-offs for various fulfillment options. research exploring the potential operational and financial benefits for retailers employing omni-channel fulfillment operations is still lacking. xia and zhang (2010) are among one of the first to empirically investigate the potential advantages of multi-35  channel retailers in comparison to traditional retailers. their findings show that retailers operating multiple channels achieve superior operational and financial performance outcomes in comparison to single-channel retailers. however, their research focuses exclusively on comparing different types of retailers and does not consider the impact of different fulfillment operations, per se. in addition, their study only considers retailers operating up until 2008, which was before the majority of retailers developed omni-channel fulfillment operations. further research has corroborated their findings (forrester research, inc. 2014), while others have contradicted it, failing to report any performance improvements due to the implementation of omni-channel fulfillment operations (pwc 2015).  given such limited, yet diversified and seemingly conflicting findings, a study that further investigates the impact of omni-channel fulfillment operations on the performance of retail firms is undoubtedly warranted. in this way, this research contributes to the relevant literature stream by empirically examining the operational and financial effects retailers from three different retail segments (general merchandise, drug and food, and apparel) might experience when implementing omni-channel fulfillment operations.  conceptual framework and hypotheses   ambidexterity is a relatively recent theoretical view which has primarily been addressed by organizational research (raisch and birkinshaw 2008) but has, of late, also been used in the operations management discipline (e.g. patel et al. 2012; kristal et al. 2010). ambidexterity originated in the organizational learning literature (march 1991) and implies that in order to be successful, firms should meet current business demands (exploitation) while simultaneously adapting to environmental changes (exploration) (duncan 1976; gibson and birkinshaw 2004; tushman and o\\'reilly 1996).  36  according to march (1991, 71) exploitation is defined as a firm\\'s activities that are characterized by, for example, refinement, efficiency, implementation, and execution, whereas exploitation is understood as a firm\\'s activities that include risk taking, experimentation, flexibility, discovery, and innovation to name a few. contrary to earlier research, which argued that firms cannot achieve alignment between their exploration and exploitation activities (hannan and freeman 1977), march (1991) suggests that firms that are able to create and foster such a balance and in so doing, will achieve greater performance outputs. considered individually, exploitation is likely to lead to more short-term performance enhancements, whereas exploration is believed to impact long-term performance (march 1991). however, taken together a firm balancing exploratory and exploitative firm activities is likely to achieve short-term, as well as long-term performance outcomes, and hence, better performance outcomes over all. based on the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity, i developed a model proposing that a retailer\\'s operational and financial performance is dependent on the balance it maintains between its exploratory and exploitative fulfillment operations. furthermore, external factors, such as firm-specific characteristics (e.g. resource endowment) is believed to further amplify the relationship between ambidexterity and firm performance, which are thus accounted for in the theoretical model outlined in figure 1. 37   figure 2: theoretical model for this study, i build upon the exploration and exploitation constructs and define them within the context of retail fulfillment operations, where exploratory fulfillment operations are denoted by activities which aim to develop and establish new and innovative fulfillment options and exploitative fulfillment operations are denoted by activities that help to improve and refine pre-established fulfillment operations. following uotila et al. (2009), the balance between exploration and exploitation is readily apparent when looking specifically at a firm\\'s relative exploration activities. a low relative exploration indicates that retailers primarily focus on exploitative fulfillment operations whereas a high relative exploration is an indicator for retailers focusing primarily on exploratory fulfillment operations.  successful omni-channel fulfillment operations are dependent on inventory management and inventory allocation in the supply chain (e.g. bretthauer et al. 2010; alptekinoğlu and tang 2005). following prior research, operational performance is defined as the extent to which a retailer is able to effectively manage its inventory (alan et al. 2014; gaur et al. 2005). thus, for the purpose of this study operational performance refers to a firm\\'s inventory turnover, gross margin return on investment, and cash conversion cycle. financial performance, as it is defined in the extant literature, is understood in terms of return based metrics, such as return on assets and return on investment (e.g. carr 1999; vickery et al. 38  2003), or market value based metrics, like tobin\\'s q (jacobs et al. 2010; uotila et al. 2009). in line with the previous research then, exploring the impact of ambidexterity on financial performance, i.e. market value, seems appropriate (uotila et al. 2009), especially since market value has the advantage of capturing long-term and short-term performance effects (lubatkin and shrieves 1986; allen 1993). thus, for the purposes of this research, financial performance is defined as market value.  exploratory and exploitative activities are fundamentally different in terms of their underlying structures, processes, and resources; this causes tension between exploratory and exploitative activities within a firm (he and wong 2004). for example, firms face significant risks in terms of not achieving optimal performance outcomes when they exclusively emphasize one activity (e.g. exploration or exploitation) over the other. firms focusing on exploitation might experience short-term performance benefits, however, they might fail to report positive long-term performance outputs, since these firms are not able to adapt to environmental changes (uotila et al. 2009). as a result, these companies are likely to experience a competency trap since they lack the necessary capabilities to adjust and address changes in their environment (levitt and march 1988). for example, radio shack announced bankruptcy in early 2015 after failing to adapt to changes in the retail sector due to the emergence of the internet (ruiz and de la merced 2015). radio shack is thus an example of a retailer that focused on exploiting its pre-existing fulfillment operations in its physical stores, without taking into account changes in the online retail environment. as a result, they were not able to sustain future activities and were forced to declare bankruptcy.  alternatively, retailers focusing exclusively on exploratory activities might find themselves exposed to the risk of  a reiterative circle of searching for and developing new 39  fulfillment operations (levinthal and march 1993) with highly variable and often volatile long-term benefits (uotila et al. 2009). since these retailers\\' pre-existing competencies and capabilities are not continuously refined or improved in a timely manner, they miss out on realizing many short-term benefits (march 1991). for instance amazon, a retailer known for its innovativeness always exploring new fulfillment activities, reported positive profits for the very first time eight years after the company was founded (stone 2013). in sum, based on the premises of ambidexterity, firms concentrating on either exploitative or exploratory activities, but not both, will experience less than optimal performance outcomes (march 1991). consequently, rather than focusing on trade-offs between exploration and exploitation, research shows that companies should become ambidextrous to achieve superior firm performance. the tenets of ambidexterity calls for retailers to establish a balance between refining their pre-existing fulfillment operations and discovering new fulfillment operations (e.g. offering online orders and in-store pick up) in order to achieve superior operational and financial performance outcomes. prior research has demonstrated that firms can achieve higher performance outcomes if they are able to balance their exploitative and exploratory activities (he and wong 2004; junni et al. 2013; cao et al. 2009). the literature situated in the operations management realm has corroborated this claim, evidencing the importance of ambidextrous operations in order to achieve better performance outcomes (patel et al. 2012). thus, an inverted u-shape relationship is hypothesized: h1: a retailer\\'s relative exploration exhibits a curvilinear relationship on the retailer\\'s financial performance such that retailers focusing predominantly on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities will exhibit lower tobin\\'s q than retailers balancing exploitative and exploratory (medium relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. h2: a retailer\\'s relative exploration exhibits a curvilinear relationship on the retailer\\'s operational performance such that: 40  h2a: retailers focusing predominantly on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities will exhibit lower inventory turns than retailers balancing exploitative and exploratory (medium relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. h2b: retailers focusing predominantly on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities will exhibit lower gmroi than retailers balancing exploitative and exploratory (medium relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. h2c: retailers focusing predominantly on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities will exhibit higher cash conversion cycles than retailers balancing exploitative and exploratory (medium relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities.  based on our discussion above, retailers concentrating on exploitative or exploratory activities face the risk of either achieving only short-term benefits or only long-term benefits leading to less than optimal performance outcomes overall (march 1991). literature suggests that the ambidexterity-performance relationship might also depend on firm-specific factors, such as resource endowment, which refers to a firm\\'s availability of resources (raisch and birkinshaw 2008). according to the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity, exploratory and exploitative activities stand in competition for a firm\\'s available resources (march 1991), as firms face the challenge of deciding which activities to allocate their available resource to.  the management and allocation of available resources within a firm depends on the firm\\'s organizational structure (moch 1976). thus, the success of balancing exploratory and exploitative fulfillment operations will depend to the extent that a retailer is able to manage and allocate its resources accordingly. in general, large firms can be characterized by having a complex hierarchical structure impeding the resource allocation within the organization (blau 1968). contrary, small firms lacking a complex structural hierarchy are able to allocate resources fairly easy across the organization to various business activities (moch 1976). thus, specifically large firms might experience difficulty in managing and attaining their resource 41  allocating in a balance of exploratory and exploitative business activities. however, for small firms lacking a complex organizational structure it can be easier to cope with the management and allocation of resources making the achievement and attainment of a balance between exploitation and exploration more beneficial. prior research has shown that smaller firms with limited resource availability benefit most by focusing on achieving a balance between exploitation and exploration (cao et al. 2009). therefore, i hypothesize: h3: resource endowment moderates the relationship between a retailer\\'s relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its financial performance such that the relationship between a retailer\\'s relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its tobin\\'s q is negatively moderated by resource endowment. h4: resource endowment moderates the relationship between a retailer\\'s relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its operational performance such that: h4a: resource endowment negatively moderates the relationship between a retailer\\'s relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its inventory turn. h4b: resource endowment negatively moderates the relationship between a retailer\\'s relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its gmroi. h4c: resource endowment positively moderates the relationship between a retailer\\'s relative explorative omni-channel fulfillment operational activities and its cash conversion cycle.  methodology  data the data for this study are compiled from two different data sources. firm-level financial data were collected from compustat and firm-level data pertaining to a retailer\\'s omni-channel fulfillment operations were collected from electronic press releases from the lexis-nexis database. this approach is in line with other research using secondary data to investigate the ambidexterity-performance relationship (e.g. uotila et al. 2009). furthermore, 42  scholars have called for more research employing longitudinal data sets to explore the impact of ambidexterity on firm performance as a way to gain a better understanding of the effects over time (kristal et al. 2010; patel et al. 2012).  while most retailers introduced omni-channel fulfillment operations after 2010, leading omni-channel retailers, such as macy\\'s and walmart, began as early as 2007/2008. to ensure these earlier press releases are taken into account, the longitudinal data were collected starting from 2004 until 2014, spanning a ten year period. this time period has been selected to ensure that sufficient data are available pertaining to retailer omni-channel fulfillment operations, insofar as it is a fairly recent phenomenon.  sample following prior research (alan et al. 2014; gaur et al. 2005), the selection of retail firms was based on the four-digit standard industry classification (sic) codes that the u.s. bureau of commerce assigns to each company within industry segments. the sample includes 164 publicly traded retailers from 12 different retail industry segments, which is in line with previous research focusing on the context of the retail industry (gaur, fisher, and raman 2005). based on the sic codes and similarity in terms of products sold by the retailers, we created three sic groups. sic group 1 consolidates general merchandise stores, sic group 2 food and drug stores, and sic group 3 apparel retailers. table 1 summarizes the retail industry segments and their respective sic codes. a total of 25 retailers was removed from the sample due to not having at least four consecutive yearly observations between 2004 and 2014 or being international retailers. the final sample consists of 39 u.s. retailers in sic group 1, 44 u.s. retailers in sic group 2, and 56 u.s. retailers in sic group 3. the overall sample has a total of 1289 firm level observations.   43  firms operating in highly dynamic and competitive environments are more prone to become ambidextrous than firms operating in less dynamic and competitive environments (raisch and birkinshaw 2008). sic groups 1 through 3 represent different subgroups of retailers facing unique environmental conditions within their respective retail segments. for example, sic group 2 (food and drug stores) is associated with a less dynamic and competitive retail environment in comparison to sic group 1 (general merchandise stores) and 3 (apparel) (mazzone & associates, inc. 2015). hence, one would expect that the predicted relationships might depend on the retail segment that retailers are operating in and thus, i subsequently test the hypotheses for each individual sic group to control for the unique environmental settings each retail segment is facing and to gain more nuanced insights. table 1: retail industry segments with

gap inc.  content analysis  this research employed a structured content analysis of press releases concerning u.s. retailers as a way to capture activities pertaining to omni-channel fulfillment operations. the extant operations and supply chain management research that employs structured content 44  analyses is limited, but such a method may prove particularly useful in extracting and analyzing data from archival documents, such as press releases or company reports (tangpong 2011). for example, this method has been used by operation and supply chain scholars to explore firms\\' social responsibility (tate et al. 2010) and environmental management activities (montabon et al. 2007; hofer et al. 2012). thus, this research approach is in line with other studies implementing structured content analysis. the press releases were collected from the lexis-nexis database and i limited the search within the database to the archives of business wire and pr newswire. only those press releases that contained the name of the retailer in the headline and discussed a retailer\\'s fulfillment operations were inlcuded. once all press releases were collected, duplicates were removed and the word frequency for exploratory and exploitative words using atlas.ti was extracted. with the availability of content analysis software, manual coding has been widely replaced by automated computer coding. research shows that there is no significant difference in the accuracy between automated and human coding (king and lowe 2003), thus automated coding is a feasible alternative to human coding procedures (neuendorfer 2002) and is used for the purpose of this research.  this methodological approach is in line with uotila et al. (2009) who developed a methodology to assess a firm\\'s ambidexterity based on secondary data and frequency word counts. i extended uotila et al.\\'s (2009) methodological approach by tailoring the operational definition of exploration and exploitation to a supply chain and operations management context. uotila et al. (2009) used the rather general definition for exploration and exploration following march (1991). march (1991) refers to exploration as terms such as \"search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, innovation\" and 45  exploitation as terms such as \"refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, execution.\"  to extend and adjust the operational definition of exploitation and exploration to a supply chain and operations management context, i developed a list containing synonyms of the proposed terms by march (1991) from three different online dictionaries (theasaurus.com, oxforddictionaires.com, and merriam-webster.com). any word duplicates were removed leaving a list of 384 potential synonyms. two independent coders were selected to evaluate each of the word, determining whether they should be included as a synonym within the context of supply chain and operations management or not. the coders were provided a detailed description for the coding process. the percent agreement between the two independent coders was 80.7%. any discrepancies between the two coders were resolved by the primary researcher. a total of 40 additional synonyms representing the supply chain and operations management context were included to operationalize exploration and exploitation. table 2 summarizes the word roots which were used in this research. table 2: operationalization of exploration and exploitation   word roots exploration explor*, search*, variation*, risk*, experiment*, play*, flexib*, discover*, innovat*, analy*, investig*, reserch*, study*, pursu*, adjust*, change*, develop*, modific*, redesign*, revamp*, shift*, transform*,  test*, trial*, interact*, operat*, accomodat*, cooperat*, resilience*, variab*, identifi*, utili*  exploitation exploit*, refine*, choice*, production*, efficien*, select*, implement*, execute*, expan*, improve*, upgrade*, assembl*, build*, construct*, manufactur*, output*, produc*, capab*, capacit*, pick*, execut*, handl*, operat*, fulfill*   note: words in bold indicate the original synonyms proposed by march (1991)   46  independent variables exploration and exploitation  following the approach of uotila et al. (2009), the main variable of interest is a retailer\\'s relative amount of exploratory versus exploitative omni-channel fulfillment activities that can be observed at the firm-level. the relative amount of exploration versus exploitation was calculated for each retailer (by year) by dividing the number of word occurrences that relate to exploratory activities by the sum of exploratory and exploitative words. this approach was used previously by uotila et al. (2009) to measure companies\\' ambidexterity based on data  from a structured content analysis;  resource endowment  following prior literature, firm size is an effective proxy from which to measure a firm\\'s resource availability (cao et al. 2009; lin et al. 2007), since large firms often have higher resource availability than small firms (chen and hambrick 1995; boyer et al. 1996). firm size has been operationalized in various ways, but is most commonly done so in terms of the number of employees a firm has, i.e. its human resources (e.g. cao et al. 2009; koufteros et al. 2007) or with regards to a firm\\'s sales in dollars (e.g. hofer et al. 2012) or assets (e.g. lin et al. 2007; eroglu and hofer 2011) which refers to its physical resource availability. in the context of this research, a firm\\'s physical resources are most appropriate to study the ambidexterity-performance relationship. since this research focuses on omni-channel fulfillment operations, resources for day-to-day operations (current assets) as well as fixed physical resources (fixed assets) are expected to play an important role for retailers developing ambidextrous fulfillment operations. thus, in line with previous operations management 47  research, firm size will be measured in terms of a retailer\\'s total assets (e.g. eroglu and hofer 2011).  dependent variables operational and financial performance  for retailers, inventory management is one of the key operational activities. retailers strive to reduce their optimal inventory levels to enhance their overall competitiveness and performance. since omni-channel fulfillment operations are directly related to a restructuring of inventory allocation and management in the retail supply chain, inventory effectiveness is an appropriate operational outcome to explore. prior research has primarily focused on inventory productivity (e.g. chen et al. 2007; huson 1995; gaur et al. 2005; alan et al. 2014) and several different measures have been proposed, such as inventory turnover or gross margin return on inventory (gmroi) (alan et al. 2014). following alan et al. (2014), i will focus on inventory turnover and gmroi as our inventory productivity measures. in addition, i focus on the cash conversion cycle as an additional important operational outcome variable (e.g. hendricks et al. 2009) since it reflects how fast a company can turn its resource investments into cash. the three measures were calculated as follows: (i) inventory turnover (it) 𝐼𝑇𝑖𝑡 =𝐶𝑂𝐺𝑆𝑖𝑡 − 𝐿𝐼𝐹𝑂𝑖𝑡 + 𝐿𝐼𝐹𝑂𝑖,𝑡−1𝐼𝑁𝑉𝑖𝑡 + 𝐿𝐼𝐹𝑂𝑖𝑡 (ii) gmroi 𝐺𝑀𝑅𝑂𝐼𝑖𝑡 =𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑡 − 𝐶𝑂𝐺𝑆𝑖𝑡 + 𝐿𝐼𝐹𝑂𝑖,𝑡 − 𝐿𝐼𝐹𝑂𝑖,𝑡−1𝐼𝑁𝑉𝑖𝑡 + 𝐿𝐼𝐹𝑂𝑖𝑡 48  (iii) cash conversion cycle (ccc) 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑡 = 𝐷𝑎𝑦𝑠 𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑖𝑡 +  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑖𝑡− 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑖𝑡 prior research has highlighted the important linkage between a firm\\'s operational and financial performance (e.g. hendricks and singhal 2005; hendricks and singhal 2009; alan, et al. 2014). accordingly, this study also pays particular attention to a retailer\\'s financial performance. in line with previous research, market value serves as an appropriate outcome variable (uotila et al. 2009). market value has been operationalized in the operations management literature as tobin\\'s q (e.g. setia and patel 2013; modi and mishra 2011) and has the advantage of capturing long-term and short-term performance results (lubatkin and shrieves 1986; allen 1993). tobin\\'s q (tq) is calculated as follows: (𝑖) 𝑇𝑄𝑖𝑡 =𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠𝐵𝑜𝑜𝑘 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 since the data set spans a time period of 10 years, a dummy variable to account for the economic recession occurring in late 2008 was included. year 2004 through 2008 are coded as 0 and years 2009 through 2014 are coded as 1. hence, the year dummy is capturing the potential impact the economic recession of 2008 might have had on retailers\\' financial and operational performance. table 3 provides an overview of the variable definitions and descriptive statistics.    49  table 3: variable description and descriptive statistics variable description mean std. deviation tq tobin\\'s q is calculated as a retailer\\'s market value of assets over its book value of assets. compustat: (at-ceq+csho*price)/at 1.93 1.73 tq_lagged tobin\\'s q lagged by one period. 1.93 1.78 it inventory turn  7.26 9.21 it_lagged inventory turn lagged by one period 7.24 9.28 ccc cash conversion cycle 52.71 46.85 ccc_lagged cash conversion cycle lagged by one period. 52.82 43.93 gmroi gross margin return on investment 3.48 3.38 gmroi_lagged gross margin return on investment lagged by one period 3.43 2.92 relexp relative exploration 0.21 0.29 ta_log log transformation of total assets 6.99 1.86 n=138 empirical analysis and results  a dynamic panel data model was used to test the hypotheses. based on the characteristics of the data set, a two-step dynamic gmm estimator was applied using xtabond2 in stata (roodman 2009). the data set is unbalanced and has missing values. the gmm estimator accounts for missing values by using orthogonality conditions and hence, exploits all the information that is potentially available in the data set using internal instrument (roodman 2009). since the number of instruments is quartic in the time period, i controlled for the number of instruments used in the model by employing the collapse demand in stata. the dynamic gmm model is an appropriate estimator for a dynamic model with a large number of cross-section units (n=131 retailers) and a small time period (t=11 years). furthermore, the explanatory variables cannot be assumed to be strictly exogenous and hence, one must account for potential endogeneity. the difference gmm estimator allows to estimate models with predetermined and/or endogenous explanatory variables.  50  the year dummy and log transformed total assets were treated as strictly exogenous variables. the lag of the dependent variables entered the model as endogenous variables, and following uotila et al. (2009) relative exploration was treated as a predetermined variable. for each of the four dependent variables i estimated three models: model 1 is the base model including the control variables, model 2 includes the main effect variables and tests hypotheses 1 and 2, and model 3 includes the interaction terms to test hypothesis 3 and 4.  for sic group 1 (general merchandise stores) there is a significant curvilinear relationship between relative exploration and tobin\\'s q. the result indicates that retailers in this segment who are able to balance exploitative and exploratory fulfillment operational activities (medium relative exploration) exhibit higher tobin\\'s q than retailers who focus predominately on either exploitative (low relative exploration) or exploratory (high relative exploration) fulfillment operational activities. hence, h1 is supported for sic group 1. however, resource endowment does not function as a moderator of the relationship between relative exploration and retailers\\' financial performance, leading to rejecting h3 for sic group 1. furthermore, for the remaining dependent variables (it, gmroi, and ccc) no significant effect of a retailer\\'s relative exploration was detected suggesting that retailers in sic group 1 do not gain operational efficiencies due to becoming more ambidextrous in terms of their fulfillment operations. we reject h2a, h2b, and h2c for sic group 1. moreover, resource endowment does not moderate the relationship between a retailer\\'s relative exploration and its operational performance. therefore, h4a, h4b, and h4c are rejected. error! reference ource not found. reports the statistical results for sic group 1.   51  table 4: empirical results of the dynamic gmm models for sic group 1 dv: tobin\\'s q sic1 dv: it sic1  model 1 model 2 model 3  model 1 model 2 model 3 relexp  1.903*** 2.927 relexp  0.091 0.360   (0.593) (2.187)   (0.308) (0.999) relexp2  -1.637** -2.140  relexp2  -0.041 -1.102   (0.807) (3.225)   (0.371) (1.506) relexp*ta_log   -0.151 relexp*ta_log   -0.030    (0.232)    (0.103) relexp2*ta_log   0.073 relexp2*ta_log   0.126    (0.328)    (0.155) tq_lagged 0.707*** 0.682*** 0.426*** it_lagged 0.383** 0.419*** 0.435***  (0.135) (0.135) (0.104)  (0.165) (0.141) (0.128) ta_log -0.032 -0.068* -0.028 ta_log 0.111 0.143 0.127  (0.026) (0.039) (0.043)  (0.107) (0.111) (0.113) yeardummy 0.236*** 0.289*** 0.242*** yeardummy -0.096 -0.100 -0.088  (0.078) (0.048) (0.068)  (0.064) (0.074) (0.061) constant 0.593* 0.642* 0.798* constant 1.545 1.213 1.308  (0.329) (0.347) (0.414)  (1.121) (1.082) (1.032) wald chi2 37.59 (3) 72.42 (5) 58.59 (7) wald chi2 6.39 (3) 13.04 (5) 23.69 (7) hansen 0.020 0.525 0.967 hansen 0.223 0.380 0.970 ar(1) z -1.59 -1.60 -1.64 ar(1) z -1.63 -1.70 -1.70 ar(2) z -1.50 -1.45 -1.57 ar(2) z 0.99 1.01 1.01 number of instruments 13 35 57 number of instruments 23 34 56 note: tq_lagged=tobin\\'s q lagged by one period;

ta_log=log transformation of total assets discussion  the empirical results support that retailers in certain segments who are able to balance exploitative and exploratory fulfillment operational activities achieve higher financial performance than retailers who focus predominately on either exploitative or exploratory fulfillment operational activities. this is specifically the case for general merchandise (sic group 1) and apparel (sic group 3) retailers operating in highly dynamic and competitive retail segments. it is suggested that retailers who are becoming ambidextrous in terms of their fulfillment operations are able to harvest short-term as well as potential long-term financial benefits. hence, these retailers are likely to gain a financial advantage over other retailers focusing on either exploitation or exploration despite increasing fulfillment costs. based on the empirical evidence, food and drug stores (sic group 1) do not seem to benefit financially from being ambidextrous in terms of their fulfillment operations. the food 61  and drug retail segment can be characterized as being  relatively mature and stable (mazzone & associates, inc. 2015). since the reason for a firm to pursue explorative activities is to adapt to changes in the environment, firms operating in stable environments might not need to invest in explorative activities and achieve a balance between exploitative and exploratory activities. prior research suggests that achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation is specifically important for firms operating in highly dynamic environments and does not have a significant performance impact for firms operating in stable environments (zahra and george 2002).  in addition to exploring the linkage of operational ambidexterity and financial performance, i also examined the potential impacts on a retailer\\'s operational performance. while the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity and its impact on a firm\\'s financial performance have received support in prior research (e.g. he and wong 2004; uotila et al. 2009), extending it to a firm\\'s operational performance is rather new. a retailer\\'s ambidexterity in terms of omni-channel fulfillment operations did not lead to enhancement in terms of inventory turns. this was a consistent finding across all three sic groups and anecdotal evidence might explain the lack of support. retailers investing into omni-channel fulfillment operations frequently report operational inefficiencies due to exploring new fulfillment opportunities while exploiting already established ones (aptos, inc. 2016). for example, until recently american eagle operated separate distribution centers for its in-store and online fulfillment services which increased its operational expenses (guillot 2016). since the emergence of the omni-channel retail environment is a rather recent phenomenon and retailers are still struggling to adjust to the operational challenges, the data might have captured a time period which is characterized by operational inefficiencies.  62  however, i do observe that apparel retailers (sic group 3) who are becoming operationally ambidextrous in terms of their fulfillment activities achieve a higher gmroi than apparel retailers focusing on either exploitation or exploration. thus, operationally ambidextrous apparel retailers have a greater ability to turn their respective inventory into cash which might also be due to generally higher margins (mazzone & associates, inc. 2015) and the notion that 18% of each sale has been shown to come from satisfying consumers\\' omni-channel expectations (aptos, inc. 2016). moreover, the insights from the results pertaining to the potential moderating effect of firm size are more nuanced. based on the theoretical underpinnings we expected small retailers to be better at managing and allocating their available resources due to the lack of a complex organizational structure (moch 1976) and hence, to be better attain the balance between exploratory and exploitative fulfillment operations. in line with the predictions, the results illustrate that resource endowment plays an important role in the context of omni-channel retailing specifically when focusing on operational performance outcomes. for example, while there is lack of evidence of operational ambidexterity impacting performance outcomes for sic group 2 overall, the results show that the effect is contingent on retailer size. hence, although larger retailers might have more resources available, in line with prior research (cao et al. 2009) i found evidence that smaller retailers benefit more from achieving and attaining a balance between exploitative and exploratory activities which might be due to their ability to easier cope with their resource allocation and management.   63  theoretical contributions  by employing a relatively novel data collection and generation approach i was able to provide more nuanced insights into the phenomenon under study. ambidexterity has only recently been addressed in the operations management literature. the limited number of studies use survey data providing only subjective insights from key informants at one specific point in time. to overcome these limitations, i followed the call for research implementing content analysis (tangpong 2011) and using a variety of different data sources (k. boyer and swink 2008) for operations management studies. by combining the ambidexterity data extracted from press releases and actual financial and operational measures from compustat, i provided objective measures for the ambidexterity-performance relationship. this approach led to a longitudinal data set which allowed me to investigate the phenomenon over time overcoming the limitations of using survey data (kristal et al. 2010; patel et al. 2012). in addition, i am building on the methodological approach of uotila et al. (2009) who defined exploitation and exploration in a broad business context following the original definitions from march (1991). i recognized this as a limitation and systematically adjusted the definitions for exploitation and exploration to a supply chain and operations management context. hence, i extended the vague and rather broadly held theoretically definitions of exploitation and exploration to the operations management context.  furthermore, by considering three sub segments of retailers in this study, i was able to provide more nuanced insights for the importance of the environmental context when examining the impact of operational ambidexterity on performance. the environmental circumstances seem to play an important role for our understanding of why some retailers are able to achieve performance enhancements due to balancing exploratory and exploitative 64  fulfillment operations while others may not. hence, this study highlights the environmental context as an important boundary condition for the ambidexterity-performance relationship. lastly, the premises of ambidexterity might provide a theoretical explanation for the reporting of mixed performance outcomes of retailers operating in an omni-channel retail environment (pwc 2015). based on this research, retailers failing to report any performance enhancements due to developing omni-channel fulfillment operations might solely focus on exploring new fulfillment operations rather than striving for a balance between exploiting their already established fulfillment operations while simultaneously developing new fulfillment operations. hence, this research furthers our understanding of the ambidexterity-performance relationship for retail supply chain management research.  managerial implications  while the development of omni-channel fulfillment operations is still growing, it is slowly becoming the norm. based on a recent survey, for 80% of retailers omni-channel fulfillment operations are either not profitable or they are not aware of it (aptos, inc. 2016). i provide evidence to managers that specifically within the general merchandise and apparel retail segment the investment in omni-channel fulfillment operations improves a retailer\\'s profitability. hence, specifically retailers operating in highly dynamic and competitive retail segments might benefit financially from establishing omni-channel fulfillment operations.   however, managers should also be aware of the potential operational inefficiencies they might face especially at the beginning of investing in omni-channel fulfillment operations. as the results indicate, retailers in the apparel segment who have invested in developing omni-channel fulfillment operations for probably the longest period of time are just seeing now at 65  least some positive impacts on their operational performance. thus, while retailers developing omni-channel fulfillment operations might achieve financial improvements rather in a short-term, the potential operational improvements might only be achieved after a longer period of time.  furthermore, it is suggested that large retailers as well as small retailers seem to benefit from investing into omni-channel fulfillment operations. while small retailers might not have as many resources available as large retailers do, the former might benefit most from achieving a balance between exploiting already established and exploring new fulfillment operations rather than focusing on either exploration or exploitation. larger retailers, however, have the advantage of being able to draw upon their available pool of slack resources (chen and hambrick 1995) and maintain periods of focusing on either exploration or exploitation. thus, specifically managers of smaller retailers that currently focus on either exploitation or exploration should allocate their limited resources accordingly and try to achieve a balance between these both activities.  future research the contextual setting selected for this research is quite unique. the data set represents a time period (2004-2014) where omni-channel retailing just started to emerge and grow over the last couple of years. the selected time period is characterized by retailers suffering from operational inefficiencies due to developing omni-channel fulfillment operations (aptos, inc. 2016). once omni-channel becomes more mature, retailers might actually be able to gain operational efficiencies. therefore, future research should extend this study to a later point in time when omni-channel retailing will be more mature. a replication of the current study 66  would provide further insights on the linkage between operational ambidexterity and financial and operational performance at different life cycle stages of omni-channel retailing. furthermore, the sample is constrained to publicly traded retailers in the u.s. and hence, the predictions are limited in terms of generalizability. thus, future research endeavors could extend this research to other geographical regions. each country has a unique retail landscape, and being able to contrast the operational ambidexterity performance relationship across different countries might provide more nuanced insights. also, future research might consider exploring online retailers and the extent to which these retailers develop ambidextrous fulfillment operations within an omni-channel retail environment. this kind of research might provide us with a better understanding of the operational ambidexterity-performance relationship within another unique retail context. however, the linkage between operational ambidexterity and performance does not have to be solely investigated within the retail industry. extending this research to other industries might provide further interesting insights.  lastly, future research might also want to explore additional boundary conditions. the rapid developments in technology (brynjolfsson et al. 2013; rigby 2011) provide retailers with new and innovative technological options, which have the potential to enhance the performance of their omni-channel fulfillment operations (anderson and lee 2000). operations and supply chain managers suggest that enabling inventory visibility across retail channels is important in facilitating successful omni-channel fulfillment operations (strang 2013). 48% of retail managers perceive inventory visibility as a major inhibitor for successful omni-channel fulfillment operation (aptos, inc. 2016). thus, exploring the potential moderating effect of inventory visibility might be an important consideration for future research.  67  references  acimovic, j., and graves, s.c. 2015. \"making

      75  introduction  the development of omni-channel fulfillment operations has led to the emergence of new operational complexities in the retail supply chain. managers are now faced with the challenge of developing new ways to efficiently and effectively manage omni-channel operations to meet consumer expectations and achieve a competitive advantage (brynjolfsson et al. 2013; strang 2013). it has been suggested that in order for retailers to be successful, they should develop the necessary capabilities to fulfill consumer demand from anywhere – the store, the distribution center, and/or directly from suppliers (strang 2013). while the role of retailers, as it pertains to fulfillment operations, has received a lot of attention in the literature (e.g. randall et al. 2006), research investigating suppliers and their operational capabilities for successful demand fulfillment within this new reality is lacking. specifically, considering the recent emergence of drop-shipping as a viable fulfillment option in the omni-channel retail environment suggest that suppliers will experience significant changes to their fulfillment operations which warrants further research. drop-shipping, also known as consumer direct fulfillment, refers to a fulfillment strategy where end-consumer orders are fulfilled directly from suppliers upon a retailer\\'s request (cheong et al. 2015). while this fulfillment strategy has been predominantly used in online retailing (e.g. randall et al. 2006; netessine and rudi 2006), it can also be successfully implement in an omni-channel retail environment. contrary to traditional retail supply chain management, suppliers may now engage  directly with end-consumers, directly fulfilling end-consumer demand in the name of a retailer (agatz et al. 2008).  as a result, suppliers are likely to experience a disruption in their current fulfillment operations and might develop new fulfillment capabilities while refining pre-established ones 76  in order to succeed within the new reality of omni-channel retailing. this suggests that suppliers may need to become \"ambidextrous\" in terms of their fulfillment operations in order to adapt to the changes in the retail environment. this is particularly important when considering the fact that suppliers might not only fulfill pallet size retail orders but simultaneously may also develop the necessary capabilities to fulfill individual consumer orders (agatz et al. 2008).  ambidexterity is simply defined as an \"individual\\'s ability to use both hands with equal ease\" (rothaermel and alexandre 2009, 759). within a business context, prior research defines ambidexterity as a balance of activities pertaining to exploitation and exploration (march 1991). thus, ambidexterity refers to firms being able to be aligned and efficient in meeting current business demands (exploitation) while simultaneously adapting to environmental changes (exploration) (duncan 1976; gibson and birkinshaw 2004; tushman and o\\'reilly 1996). building on this, the concept of operational ambidexterity, which refers to \"an operational unit\\'s simultaneous pursuit of exploration and exploitation [activities]\" (patel et al. 2012), has recently been introduced to the operations management literature. relevant research shows that firms which are able to exhibit ambidexterity in their operational activities tend to achieve superior performance outcomes (patel et al. 2012).  operations and supply chain management research falls short when it comes to exploring how companies actually achieve operational ambidexterity. even in the management literature, research considering the antecedents of ambidexterity is lacking (adler et al. 1999; siggelkow and levinthal 2003). however, it is pivotal to gain a thorough understanding of the drivers, barriers, and complexities that lead firms to achieve operational ambidexterity, specifically within the new reality of omni-channel retailing, where operational ambidexterity 77  might be the key factor to a supplier\\'s success. in response, the proposed study addresses the following research questions: (1) to what extent do suppliers exhibit ambidextrous fulfillment operations within the omni-channel retail environment? (2) what are the enablers and barriers for suppliers to develop ambidextrous fulfillment operations?  since the concept of operational ambidexterity is still relatively new and this research is exploratory in nature, a qualitative research approach will be used to address the aforementioned research questions. this is in line with the operations management literature calling for more qualitative research to address operational phenomena (barratt et al. 2011; mccutcheon and meredith 1993). in addition, the majority of the literature investigates drop-shipping from the perspective of retailers (e.g. rabinovich 2004, randall et al. 2002), developing mainly analytical models (e.g. yao et al. 2008). hence, by employing a qualitative research approach we address the methodological shortcomings associated with quantitative research methods and aim to provide a more thorough and realistic understanding of drop-shipping operations (flynn 1990). the remainder of the paper will provide a brief overview of the relevant fulfillment operations literature and discuss the theoretical foundations. subsequently, the methodological approach as well as the data collection and analysis processes will be discussed. literature review  the emergence of the internet led to a disruption in how supply chain activities are managed and executed (anderson and lee 2000). traditionally, suppliers fulfilled retailers\\' pallet-sized orders, but given the changing retail environment, suppliers are increasingly expected to also fulfill individual orders from end-consumers in the name of the retailer (agatz et al. 2008). while this latter fulfillment option, also referred to as drop-shipping, is a 78  fulfillment strategy that has been predominately used in online retailing (rabinovich et al. 2008; bailey and rabinovich 2005), it may prove a viable fulfillment option across other retailer environments as well (randall et al. 2002).  drop-shipping has been exclusively explored within the context of online retailing (e.g., rabinovich et al. 2008; ayanso et al. 2006; acimovic and graves 2015) and three streams of research can be distinguished. the first stream of research concentrates on the impact of drop-shipping on fulfillment performance (e.g., rabinovich 2005). more specifically, this body of work investigates how drop-shipping performance can be enhanced through emergency transshipment (rabinovich 2005), inventory consolidation (rabinovich and evers 2003), and coordinating order-to-ship times and delivery times (rabinovich 2004). furthermore, in the case of drop-shipping, retailers are now primarily concerned with attracting end-consumers, while suppliers are concerned with fulfillment operations. this functional separation is likely to lead to difficulties in the management of the fulfillment processes (gan et al. 2010; yao et al. 2008). however, if suppliers provide poor fulfillment performance, end-consumers are likely to hold the retailer accountable (bulger 2012; rabinovich 2005). prior research highlights the importance of the relationship between high fulfillment performance and end-consumer satisfaction and future purchase behavior (e.g. esper et al. 2003; rao et al. 2011). taken together, this stream of literature suggests that drop-shipping is likely to improve an online retailer\\'s fulfillment performance considering different members of the supply chain. while the first stream of research focuses on the potential performance outcomes, the second stream investigates the conditions under which drop-shipping might be superior to other fulfillment options for online retailers. this body of work provides evidence that online retailers should consider product (randall et al. 2002) and environmental characteristics 79  (netessine and rudi 2006) when deciding to engage in drop-shipping operations. for example, randall et al. (2002) found that it is more desirable for online retailers to have heavy and bulky products fulfilled via drop-shipping. moreover, with the option of employing different fulfillment operations retailers are challenged by deciding which fulfillment option, or mix therefore, is most desirable. the majority of the research supports that a mixed approach in terms of fulfillment operations is most profitable (e.g., bailey and rabinovich 2005; netessine and rudi 2006). for instance, bailey and rabinovich (2005) show that online retailers are better of using drop-shipping in combination with owning inventory. overall, this body of work suggest that drop-shipping operations constitutes as one option of their overall fulfillment portfolio and should be employed based on evaluating more nuanced product and environmental characteristics. the third stream of research focuses on exploring how retailers best manage the relationship with their drop-shipping partners. retailers give up a fair amount of control when implementing drop-shipping (rabinovich et al. 2008); this suggests the difficulty retailers face in holding their suppliers accountable for high fulfillment performance standards. to address this issue, different management strategies, pertaining to the retailer-supplier relationship in a drop-shipping context, have been investigated. for example, research shows that revenue sharing incentives tend to improve the reliability of a drop-shipper (yao et al. 2008). the elimination of information asymmetry in the retailer-supplier relationship has also proved beneficial, insofar as discrepancies of demand and inventory information might lead to either excessive inventory or inventory unavailability (gan et al. 2010; cheong et al. 2015). in addition, retailers and suppliers may experience cost reductions and performance improvements if information accuracy can be mitigated via contracts or through information 80  transparency (i.e. sharing demand and inventory information), for example (gan et al. 2010; cheong et al. 2015). these findings are in line with other research that considers the importance of visibility for successful supply chain management (williams et al. 2013). nevertheless, the current literature falls short in addressing other important research endeavors pertaining to drop-shipping. as most intriguing appears to be the fact that within the new omni-channel retail environment suppliers are expected to develop drop-shipping fulfillment operations to meet individual end-consumer demand (orders), while simultaneously fulfilling pallet size retail orders. these different fulfillment operations are likely to rely on different operational processes and capabilities leading to tensions in suppliers\\' overall fulfillment processes. furthermore, the use of drop-shipping operations is likely to dramatically increase over the next three years (ames 2016) leading to significant changes in a supplier\\'s fulfillment operations and hence, inducing more complexity to the retail supply chain. thus, considering that suppliers play an even more critical role in achieving high fulfillment performance outcomes, an investigation of how suppliers develop drop-shipping operations and integrate these with already established fulfillment operations provides a much needed extension to the extant literature. next, the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity are offered as a way to provide further insight into this topic. theory  over the last decade, ambidexterity has emerged as a new theoretical paradigm in the organizational management literature (o\\'reilly and tushman 2013; raisch and birkinshaw 2008). the main tenet of ambidexterity, as it is understood in this context, is that in order for firms to achieve superior performance outcomes, they must strike a balance between their exploration and exploitation activities (tushman and o\\'reilly 1996).  81  according to march (1991, 71) exploitation refers to a firm\\'s activities, which are characterized by \"refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, and execution,\" whereas exploitation activities are characterized by \"search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, and innovation\". firms that focus exclusively on one activity or the other will likely experience less than optimal performance outcomes. firms emphasizing exploitation activities might not be able to adequately respond to environmental changes, due to a lack of the necessary capabilities to do so (levitt and march 1988), and firms emphasizing exploration activities might get trapped in an reiterative circle of searching for new alternatives, without achieving satisfactory performance outcomes (levinthal and march 1993).  ambidexterity has recently been applied to study operations and supply chain management phenomena (e.g. patel et al. 2012; kristal et al. 2010; blome et al. 2013). aligning the two competing organizational activities (exploitation and exploration) is recognized by operations and supply chain management scholars as a potential option for companies wanting to overcome the trade-offs between operational efficiency and adaptability (e.g. kristal et al. 2010; patel et al. 2012). the extant operations and supply chain management literature pertaining to ambidexterity is very limited. the few studies that do investigate ambidexterity within operations and supply chain management do so providing empirical evidence for the ambidexterity-performance relationship. for example, kristal et al. (2010) conceptualized supply chain ambidexterity and showed that implementing an ambidextrous supply chain strategy is helpful in developing supply chain capabilities and competencies, which leads to increased firm performance outcomes. thus, future research is warranted to gain a better understanding of how companies become operationally ambidextrous.  82  prior research has shown that especially companies operating in highly dynamic environments are likely to showcase ambidexterity (junni et al. 2013). due to the emergence of omni-channel retailing, the retail supply chain management can be described as rapidly changing and hence, highly dynamic. in order to succeed within this highly dynamic retail environment, suppliers must both sustain and improve current fulfillment operations while simultaneously developing new ones. in this way, the context of drop-shipping serves as a suitable domain to inform this study on operational ambidexterity. methodology  insofar as the proposed research questions are rather exploratory in nature, a qualitative research approach has been deemed most appropriate for this study (ellram 1996). adopting a qualitative approach allows to study the underlying structures, processes, and interrelationships of suppliers\\' ambidextrous fulfillment operations in great detail and depth (gephart 2004). furthermore, such a method will allow to investigate the phenomenon in an actual contextual setting (meredith 1998). thus, i employ an inductive research paradigm (warren and karner 2005), specifically implementing a case study approach (yin 2009).  i developed a multi-case study design following the logic of literal replication with the aim of identifying cases that would provide similar results (yin 2009). through careful case consideration i ensured that the selected cases would be representative of the phenomenon of interest. thus, the initial population consisted of retail suppliers with freight and drop-shipping operations. since fulfillment operations likely depend on product characteristics (randall, netessine, and rudi 2006) and suppliers generally manage a broad variety of different products and brands, i selected the business unit as our unit of analysis.  83  the focal company for this research is a large u.s. based appliance manufacturer consisting of several business units managing a broad variety of products and brands. due to the broad variety of product and brands, the focal company is overseeing different fulfillment operations to meet the specific brand and product requirements. for the first case i selected a fairly new business unit (alpha) that just recently started to establish drop-shipping operations. the second business unit (beta) is a well-established business unit with its own fulfillment operations and has been engaged in drop-shipping operations for a longer period of time. alpha and beta operate as separate business units and their main offices are located in different cities in the u.s. table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the selected cases. table 1: overview of case characteristics   case characteristics number of informants number of interviews informants\\' functional areas  alpha alpha is a recently established business unit within the focal company. the current goal of alpha is to gain more brand recognition among end-customers. alpha manages different fulfillment processes for a large appliance. 8 7 logistics and operations management, marketing, information systems, and finance beta beta is a well-established business unit within the focal company and manages its own separate operations. beta offers and manages different fulfillment options for small appliances. 5 4 logistics and operations management,  data collection multiple data collection methods were employed to gather rich descriptive data for the qualitative study. in-depth interviews enable researchers to perceive the world through the eyes of their research participants, which might not otherwise be possible with quantitative methods 84  (charmaz 2014). thus, the primary data collection method were in-depth interviews via case method which was triangulated with secondary qualitative data retrieved from news articles.  the primary researcher spent four days on site to conduct the interviews with several informants for each case study. while higher level managers are able to provide more strategic insights on the phenomenon of interest (joshi et al. 2003), lower level managers are able to provide more tactical insights on the phenomenon of interest. thus, i interviewed informants from different organizational levels. in addition, the primary researcher had the opportunity to visit and tour two of the focal company\\'s distribution centers to observe the operational activities. throughout the four day visit, the primary researcher also had a chance to closely shadow the key informant. i carefully developed a semi-structured interview guide with open-ended questions to guide the conversation, and probes to ask for additional description and details. appendix a provides an overview of the actual interview guide. the interviews lasted between 20 to 100 minutes, and all interviews were audio-recorded with the permission of the informants and professionally transcribed leading to a total of 160 pages of qualitative text. i conducted seven interviews at alpha and five interviews at beta. out of the total of 12 participants, nine held higher managerial positions and three lower level managerial positions. four participants held positions outside the operations/logistics area providing cross-functional insights about the phenomenon of interest.   to gain even more in-depth insights and knowledge on the phenomenon of interest i collected secondary qualitative data in the form of online news articles discussing drop-shipping operations. using news articles discussing the topic of interest allows us to triangulate our data (patton 1990). the online news articles were collected from the top online supply 85  chain management publications for industry professionals by friddell (2015). out of the originally listed 12 top supply chain management publications we selected the ones most relevant to retail supply chain management and with an open search option for articles on the website. i conducted an initial search on each of the online publications\\' websites with the search terms \"drop-shipping\" and \"drop-ship\". table 2 summarizes the top supply chain management publications used for this research and the number of initial articles from each publication. the initial search resulted in 98 articles. next, i removed any duplicates and articles published before the year 2010 since omni-channel retailing especially gained traction after 2010. the final sample constitutes 43 articles for further content analysis. table 2: selected online supply chain publications and number

coding phase of all interviews resulting in a detailed, descriptive memo for each case (ellram 1996; barratt et al. 2011). coding allows the researcher to connect contextual rich descriptions with more abstract theoretical categories, which served as the \"bones of the analysis\" (charmaz 2014, p.113).  86  the initial coding phase allowed for the emergence of a wide array of theoretical concepts and ideas stemming from the data (charmaz 2014). in the initial coding phase, i assigned a code to a smaller segment of data (i.e. sentence). after the initial coding phase, i moved on to the focused coding phase, during which i sorted, synthesized, and organized large amounts of data into more parsimonious codes.  after going through several iterations between the data and codes and organizing the focused codes in a structured manner, i conducted a cross-case analysis. this analysis allowed me to compare and identify commonalities and differences across the two cases, which allowed for a more complete and holistic understanding of the phenomenon of interest (eisenhardt 1989; yin 2009). lastly, i triangulated the findings from the two cases studies by using a content analysis of the news articles i collected. the news articles were coded using the focused codes emerging from the interview data to substantiate the findings.  to assess the thoroughness of the case study approach, i carefully addressed the proposed evaluation criteria for case study research (yin 2009; eisenhardt 1989; voss, tsikriktsis, and frohlich 2002; stuart et al. 2002): construct validity, internal validity, external validity, and reliability in the case study design and execution. table 3 summarizes the evaluation criteria and how they were implemented.   87  table 3: case

concepts   the following section describes in detail the themes and concepts that emerged from the analysis of the cases and secondary qualitative data. from the data, two frameworks emerged. the first framework is associated with drop-shipping operations and focuses on the drivers and operational challenges thereof. the second framework is grounded in the theoretical underpinning of ambidexterity and captures the underlying mechanisms of 88  operational ambidexterity. figure 1 illustrates the general framework pertaining to establishing drop-shipping operations that emerged from the data and table 4 provides descriptions and examples of the emerging themes. from the analysis of the cases and news articles three main themes emerged, which are denoted as drivers, operational challenges, and outcomes. figure 1: drop-shipping operations: drivers and operational challenges       89  table 4: description and examples for emerging codes category code description example  drivers reacting refers to the supplier developing drop-shipping operations to address the changing retail environment \"the market for supply chain design is growing as more companies realize they have to reexamine their networks, and make sure their network of distribution centers and plants are in line with changing market conditions.\"   accepting refers to the supplier developing drop-shipping operations as a necessity \"so it came out of necessity really, where retailer a and retailer b were not going to hold inventory, they wanted us to just ship direct to their consumers.\"    penetrating refers to the supplier developing drop-shipping operations to gain access to more end-customers \"i think when xyz was originally launched the perspective was to let\\'s get in as many doors as we can\"  operational challenges customization refers to the supplier\\'s problems with customizing the drop-shipping processes \"now since the consumer\\'s ordering them, instead of a two-pack of blenders, they want a single blender.\"   complying refers to the individual supply chain members problems with adhering to requirements \"really as we were onboarding them, trying to get that information on them on the front end.\"    coordinating refers to supplier\\'s problems with managing the drop-shipping operations \"we\\'re expected to get the d to c orders out the door within 24 hours of receiving them here.  so that\\'s how the people on the floor are supposed to prioritize the work.\"         90  drivers of drop-shipping operations  the analysis demonstrates that there are three predominant reasons why suppliers business units/companies decide to establish drop-shipping operations. the first driver of establishing drop-shipping is that suppliers are reacting to the changes in the retail environment. consumer expectations in this new omni-channel retail environment are steadily increasing especially due to the \"amazon effect\" (ames 2016). as a theme the \"amazon effect\" emerged from the secondary qualitative data. the \"amazon effect\" refers to amazon\\'s offering of free and fast shipping which consequently leads to consumers expecting an equivalent high service offerings to be the norm across other retailers (shiphawk 2015). within this new retail environment constituting of high consumer expectations and a fierce competition from other businesses, alpha considers it as a necessity for businesses to rethink and restructure fulfillment operations. a marketing manager at alpha notes: \"if people are going online and order their stuff themselves it affects how much brick-and-mortar do you need anymore? how many real buildings? you know, everyone had to redefine.\" hence, suppliers seem to develop and establish drop-shipping operations to \"redefine\" themselves and to adequately react to the changes occurring in the retail environment.  a second theme that emerged for the drivers for drop-shipping operations is accepting drop-shipping operations as a requirement from the retailer. the case observations indicate that the retailer plays an important role for suppliers to establishing drop-shipping observations for two reasons. specifically, the observations for alpha substantiate that retailers \"rule the show\" almost forcing the business unit to engage in drop-shipping. hence, suppliers might not have another choice than to follow the retailer\\'s requirement and establish drop-shipping operations. one of the logistics/operations managers stated: \"well, their role was really to 91  force our hand to develop that because they weren\\'t going to sell with us if we weren\\'t going to ship direct to consumer.\"  another reason why suppliers simply accept the fact that they have to establish drop-shipping operations might be due to product characteristics. alpha, managing a large and heavy appliance, experienced reluctance from retailers to further stock the product due to the weight and length dimensions of the product. a logistics/operations manager from alpha noted: \"again, it\\'d be something they don\\'t handle very well with the size and that.  so they said, \"if you want to do business here, you\\'re going to do it direct to consumer.\"   lastly, suppliers establish drop-shipping operations as a way of directly penetrating the consumer market. in the drop-shipping model the retailer as \"middleman\" is removed, providing suppliers with direct access to end-customers. in addition, suppliers are also able to offer a larger product variety to end-customers to subsequently increase their market share. thus, the overarching theme of directly penetrating the consumer market consists of accessing end-customers and of servicing end-customers better with a larger product variety. in the case of beta, a logistics/operations manager extensively discussed that drop-shipping operations were established to have access to a larger end-customer base to gain a competitive advantage. the manager noted: \"we want to expand drop ship because we think we\\'ll be able to sell a bigger assortment of products for our retailers and they don\\'t have to hold the inventory.  there is a belief that we are missing out on sales and so we need to expand it to more retailers and more footprints.\"    92  operational challenges of drop-shipping operations  operational challenges associated with establishing and managing drop-shipping operations emerged as another major theme from the data. while suppliers are used to the processes of fulfilling freight orders for their retailers, the requirement of directly fulfilling end-customer orders involves new processes for the supplier. hence, suppliers adding drop-shipping operations to their fulfillment capabilities are likely to experience operational tensions and challenges the first operational challenge emerging from the cases was customizing the drop-shipping fulfillment process. for example, end-customers might wish to have the product wrapped in gift-wrapping paper or attach a personal note to their order leading to highly customized orders. one factor contributing to the high customization of the drop-shipping process are any value-added services the supplier is executing. hence, each end-customer order is not only different in terms of the products that need to be picked but also in terms of what additional services the end-customers request. a logistics/operations manager from aplpha referred to value-added services as \"a nightmare\" since it adds additional complexity to the fulfillment process. a manager from beta further elaborated: \"like with product x, product x is kind of a huge nightmare because the co2 tanks in them make them hazmat so we have to ship them out specially so they have to be in the vas station to be specially processed so that they go out hazmat.  so there\\'s a lot of stuff that happens in the vas station.\"  a second factor contributing to customizing the drop-shipping process is the volume. the cases indicate that especially when only a low volume is fulfilled via drop-shipping, the fulfillment process is prone to be highly manual in nature. in the case of alpha, handling a small volume for drop-shipping, every step in the drop-shipping process was manually in the 93  beginning. a marketing manager noted: \"i mean a lot of the stuff we did was manual. i mean we actually have been drop manual, we manually dropped documents and manually send trucks and manually fix problems. so it was a nightmare from our perspective and trying to start business.\"  a second operational challenge that emerged from the data was complying with retailer requirements. the secondary qualitative data specifically highlighted the importance of vendor compliance for successful drop-shipping operations. our secondary qualitative data indicate that \"the urgency around attaining the perfect order through compliance programs is amplified, thanks to a number of factors\" (terry 2013), one of these factors being the \"increasing use of direct shipping from vendors.\" however, the observations from the cases indicate that achieving compliance might not be an easy endeavor for suppliers. suppliers work with a great number of retailers and hence, have to adhere to a lot of different requirements dictated by the retailers. a specific problem alpha experienced was that the requirements were only communicated after the sales agreement had been signed, increasing time pressure on other business functions to comply with the requirements. an information systems manager from aplha described: \"their mission is go out and get sales agreements.  so they go out and do that and we\\'re – i don\\'t want to say the afterthought, but once they get the sales agreement, then they send us all the information with a deadline that sometimes we can meet and sometimes we can\\'t meet.  99 percent of the time we do meet it, but if it\\'s a real short time frame, we meet it but we don\\'t meet it following the processes that we like to follow, but we need to follow to make sure that we have everything covered.\" the third theme that emerged was coordinating with other external and internal entities to establish drop-shipping operations. carriers play an important role in the success of drop-94  shipping processes. alpha described an incident where carriers were reluctant to adjust their processes to ensure that the product arrives at the end-customer\\'s house undamaged. the failure to coordinate with the carrier from the beginning on resulted in damaged products and hence, in unsatisfied end-customers. consequently, alpha started to adjust its packaging to prevent damage and coordinated with the carrier to ensure that the product is handled in a different manner. a logistics/operations manager recalled: \"getting them (the carrier) to look at a different shipment with different requirements reliably is incredibly difficult when they\\'re just used to turning numbers.\"  also, coordinating with internal business functions constitutes a challenge when establishing drop-shipping operations. alpha described a situation where the sales team agreed with the retailer on doing drop-shipping without consulting the logistics/operations managers first. after the agreement had been signed, alpha discovered that it actually did not have the necessary capabilities in place. \"so that capability didn\\'t exist and the people over here behind me that handle all the major stuff had no clue as to how to do any of that.\"   in addition, the observations suggest that coordinating with the it department is also of essence. in the cases, the majority of orders arrived through the edi system. however, the edi systems were configured to receive standardized retail orders but with drop-shipping the edi systems need to be compatible to receive orders where the ship to address is different for each end-customer. alpha and beta spend ample amount of time and effort with the it department to coordinate the new system configurations. a manager from alpha stated: \"chris (name changed by the author) was tremendous in the process of setting them up \\'cause he knew what the requirements were and what the capabilities were versus what we had on 95  hand and he figured out how to do the processing of the edi to override the ship to and to do an appropriate direct consumer order taking.\"    the general framework of drivers and operational challenges discussed above provides interesting insights and a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon of drop-shipping. in a second level of interpretation i was focusing on uncovering the findings pertaining to the interrelationships of exploitation, exploration, and ambidexterity to gain a better understanding how suppliers become operational ambidextrous. figure 2 illustrates the emerging findings from the second level analysis. figure 2: the cyclicality of exploitation and exploration  operational ambidexterity: an emerging process model  prior to becoming ambidextrous, suppliers focus on exploiting their already established operations (freight operations) to gain further operational efficiencies. in the case of alpha standard operating procedures have been developed and are already in place to execute freight operations. however, through a continuous improvement program developed by the mother 96  company the already existing operating procedures are steadily refined to increase performance. a manager from alpha noted: \"[the mother company\\'s] really good at continuous improvement, and putting projects around things, and trying to take as much of that variation as we can out of the system.  we have a pretty solid black belt program and green belt program to go in and try to lean out the operations and dummy proof them as much as we can. \"   the focus of improving already established operations gets disrupted by the changing retail environment. thus, suppliers seek to reinvent themselves and rethink their fulfillment operations to stay competitive within this new omni-channel retail environment which subsequently leads to the exploration of drop-shipping operations. a manager from alpha stated: \"but the ability for people to go online and learn about the product and see what\\'s going on facebook and twitter and you know. that\\'s what we learned on the major appliance side years, several years ago was what how much more educated consumers are today. they walk in with their iphone and their ipad. they know more about the appliance than you do. they have got all their reviews and all the lots and everything right there in front of them. they can check your price against whoever they want to standing right in front of you.\"  furthermore, the cases show that once the supplier acknowledges the changing retail environment, the supplier enters a phase of predominately exploring drop-shipping as a new fulfillment operation. alpha experienced the changing retail environment as a disrupting factor to their already established fulfillment operations which led alpha to \"look around at what the processes were inside of [the mother company] for direct to consumer.\"  once the supplier enters the phase of focusing on exploring drop-shipping operations, the suppliers experiences the need for balancing already established fulfillment operations with 97  developing the new drop-shipping operations (ambidexterity). the findings from the cases suggest that it depends on the volume how suppliers will manage to keep the balance between the different operational activities. alpha and beta have highly integrated fulfillment processes whereas beta\\'s seemed more advanced since they are automated. alpha, processing a small volume of drop-ship orders and having manual processes, highly integrated its processes for drop-shipping with its already existing operational processes. moreover, this highly integrative approach of balancing freight with drop-ship operations was noted by a manager from alpha as \"being the parasite\" and \"piggybacking.\" a manager further explained: \"we had to fit our processes to hit their processes because it\\'s just economically desirable to have one additional [product] or five [name of the product removed by the author] units go in with a truckload of other stuff.\"  most interestingly, from the conversations with managers from beta (processing a higher volume of drop-ship orders and having an automated system), it emerged that as volume is further increasing the managers will look into separating freight fulfillment operations from drop-shipping operations to some degree. currently beta experiences difficulties in terms of balancing freight with drop-ship orders since each of these activities has different requirements. a manager from beta explained: \"when the get mixed together, they\\'re not really mixed together.  it\\'s just these happen before these will happen, so we see really big spikes in our small pack volumes and then our freight volumes die off.  they just conversely work against each other.  so an issue with that process is not being able to differentiate them through our operational how we process them, which results in delayed times to focus on one group or the other.\"  98   the cases furthermore indicate that the phase of focusing on exploring drop-shipping operations return to a phase of exploitation. however, in this next phase of exploitation the supplier improved both, freight and drop-shipping operations suggesting that there might be a dynamic component associated with exploitation and exploration. for instance, alpha described a situation where the business unit earlier engaged in exploring how the edi processes for drop-shipping operations can be developed. once these edi processes had been developed, they can now be exploited and implemented with other trade partners. a manager from alpha recalled: \"now, if we\\'re gonna maintain retailer x i\\'m gonna work on getting them on edi just because it needs to happen.  once i get them into […] then i think i have an already established and i can just add it as an offering, so i don\\'t have to go back and redo all the testing that i\\'d done before.  so i think that\\'ll be a big win for us.\"  thus, our cases provide evidence for a cyclicality between exploitation and exploration.  discussion and literature integration    the case studies in combination with the secondary qualitative data provide interesting and nuanced understandings of drop-shipping operations and operational ambidexterity. however, to gain a broader understanding of the meaning of the findings, they should be considered within the extant literature. thus, to further interpret the findings i synthesized and integrated the prior literature on drop-shipping and operational ambidexterity into the discussion. while this research corroborates some prior findings, it more importantly offers interesting and new insights into themes not addressed in the prior literature stimulating potential future research ideas.   99  drop-shipping research on drop-shipping is limited and mainly focuses on investigating the phenomenon from the perspective of online retailers, providing insights when it would make sense for a retailer to engage in drop-shipping (randall et al. 2006). in line with the finding that retailers are an important driver for suppliers to establish drop-shipping operations, the drop-shipping literature further substantiates that retailers serve as a driver for suppliers to develop drop-shipping operations (e.g. rabinovich 2005; randall et al. 2006; bailey and rabinovich 2005). however, the findings of this study indicate that other drivers for establishing drop-shipping operations may exist which could be categorized as being external (reacting to the changing retail environment) or internal (penetrating to the market) to the supplier. the most interesting finding probably is that while suppliers might develop drop-shipping operations to service their retailers, suppliers establish drop-shipping operations for their own benefits. thus, this research contributes to the extant drop-shipping literature by providing an explanation of why suppliers establish drop-shipping operations.   retailers deciding to engage in drop-shipping leave their suppliers not only with the associated costs and risks but also the responsibility of executing all fulfillment operations to the retailer\\'s standards (rabinovich et al. 2008). while the decision for retailers to engage in drop-shipping might be more strategic in nature, the suppliers will take on all operational responsibility and associated challenges. therefore, this research extends the current drop-shipping literature by shifting the research focus away from retailers to suppliers; and hence, shifting the focus from a strategic towards a more tactical perspective since suppliers will be required to figure out the details as it pertains to establishing efficient drop-shipping operations. 100  the findings pertaining to the operational challenges of complying and coordinating suggest that these issues are rooted within the broader subject of managing relationships in supply chain management. the findings advocate that businesses appear to still operate within functional silos and lack coordination with other supply chain partners although extensively discussed in the literature (e.g. stank et al. 1999; fawcett and magnan 2002). furthermore, the finding of suppliers complying with retailers\\' requirements could be perceived as one mechanisms that governs the supplier-retailer relationship. overall, these findings suggest that there might also be a relational component to establishing and managing successful drop-shipping operations such as supplier accommodation (murfield and esper 2016) or internal and external integration (flynn et al. 2010). furthermore, prior studies employed only quantitative methods to investigate the impacts of drop-shipping operations (e.g., bendoly 2004; elliot rabinovich 2005). while quantitative methods are appropriate to explore specific relationships between two or more variables deducted from theory, these methods do not allow for a richer and descriptive exploration of the phenomenon. by employing a qualitative approach using a case study designs and secondary qualitative data, this research provides a rich and descriptive understanding of drop-shipping operations uncovering the associated drivers and operational challenges. therefore, this research helps and extends our current understanding of the drivers of drop-shipping operations and associated operational challenges. operational ambidexterity the notion of ambidexterity has only recently been introduced to the operations management field and the resulting research is fairly limited (patel et al.  2012; kristal et al. 2010). in an operations management context, the theoretical premises of ambidexterity suggest 101  that companies exploiting already existing operational activities while exploring new operational activities will achieve higher performance outcomes than if the company focuses on either of these two activities (duncan 1976; gibson and birkinshaw 2004; tushman and o\\'reilly 1996). the limited body of work on operational ambidexterity focuses exclusively on testing the theoretical underpinnings of ambidexterity rooted in the field of management neglecting why and how firms develop and manage operational ambidexterity. the qualitative research approach provided me with the opportunity to stimulate a discussion about the theoretical understanding of operational ambidexterity. a key findings from this research suggest that exploration of new operational activities require a \"trigger\" or \"disruptive event\". this observation suggests that in the context of drop-shipping, environmental changes may serve as a trigger shifting the focus of companies away from exploiting already existing business activities and leading them to focus on exploring of new business actions. prior research has shown that firms facing a highly competitive and dynamic environment exhibit tendencies to engage in exploring new business activities (jansen et al. 2005; auh and menguc 2005) and support our observations.  this research further enhances our understanding of operational ambidexterity by providing at least some insights into the widely debate about the appropriate internal structural solution to manage ambidexterity. the ambidexterity literature lacks a clear understanding whether ambidexterity is achieved through integration or separation (raisch and birkinshaw 2008). from the management literature addressing ambidexterity structural differentiation emerged as one option to successfully manage ambidexterity (e,g., tushman and o\\'reilly 1996; gilbert 2005). however, the extent to which these structural differences should be integrated is not well understood yet, and hence, warrants further investigation. considering 102  operational ambidexterity in the context of drop-shipping, the findings of this study suggest that if the processes volume for drop-shipping is low, a higher degree of operational integration is appropriate while a lower degree of integration (or separation) is perceived to be more appropriate with higher volume. thus, this research exposed volume to be an important contingency factor to consider when investigating the structural solution for managing operational ambidexterity. in addition, i was able to present some evidence suggesting that exploitation and exploration occur in a cyclical nature, suggesting that suppliers shift between phases of exploiting established operations and exploring new operations. the cyclical nature of exploitation and exploration in a drop-shipping context might suggest that operational ambidexterity is a dynamic process rather than a static status. this observation is further substantiated by nickerson and zenger (2002) and siggelkow and levinthal (2003)  who suggested that firms cycle through phases of exploitation and exploration. thus, suggesting that there is critical dynamic component to exploration and when it actually transfers into exploitation. however, prior research on operational ambidexterity focused on investigating the phenomenon at a specific point in time, neglecting any potential effects over time.  based on the discussed findings future operational ambidexterity is warranted. the discussed findings pertaining to operational ambidexterity uncover additional interesting and relevant research areas to grow the understanding of operational ambidexterity within the supply chain and operations management field. table 5 provides suggestions for additional research in different areas pertaining to operational ambidexterity.   103  table 5: future operational ambidexterity research research area future operational ambidexterity research  antecedents of operational ambidexterity investigate antecedents that shift suppliers from focusing on exploiting already established fulfillment operations to exploring new fulfillment operations. managing operational ambidexterity explore how suppliers balance already established operations with new operations depends on the processed volume such that a low volume may be associated with a higher degree of process integration than a high volume.  role of time for operational ambidexterity consider the potential time effects on exploration and exploitation. exploration of new operational activities is finite in time duration and hence, there is a specific point in time when explorations of new operational activities turns into exploitation of established operational activities.  managerial implications and future research  managerial implications the importance for suppliers to be able to provide drop-shipping operations for their customers is further increasing. the majority of retail managers expect to increase their use of drop-shipping over the next three years (ames 2016). i provide insights to managers that the request for drop-shipping might take the supplier as a surprise with a lack of preparedness. hence, in anticipation of more demand for drop-shipping operations from retailers, suppliers should evaluate whether they already have the necessary drop-ship capabilities in house and develop a plan for implementation to be better prepared for this new fulfillment option. in addition, establishing drop-shipping operations constitutes a great opportunity for suppliers to gain access to a broader end-customer base. therefore, suppliers might want to consider establishing drop-shipping operations as a viable option to further penetrate the market and to grow their market share.  104  furthermore, when establishing drop-shipping operations suppliers should work closely with other supply chain members. this research indicates that retailers play an important role for establishing successful drop-shipping operations. suppliers are likely to provide drop-shipping solutions to a broad retailer base and hence, will have to adhere to different compliance guidelines. retailers could help suppliers to achieve higher compliance rates by aligning their compliances with the ones from other retailer. for example, the retail value chain federation works with retailers to arrange the used terminology and terms to support the operations of the suppliers (terry 2013).  moreover, this research suggests that the importance of carriers and other internal departments for successful drop-shipping operations cannot be neglected. for example, if the product is damaged during the delivery process because the carrier is reluctant to adjust its handling operations from freight to individual end-customer orders, end-customer responses might be negative impacting suppliers and retailers a like. hence, carriers should be informed and integrated into establishing drop-shipping operations early on to ensure carriers have the necessary capabilities and operating procedures in place. in addition to integrating carriers, managers should also strengthen the integration of departments within the company. as the findings of this research show, especially the sales and operations functions still appear to be not integrated leading to major issues. thus, the internal integration especially between sales and operations but also with other functional areas should be increased. lastly, the findings of this research suggest that suppliers should carefully evaluate the degree of integrating their drop-shipping operations with its freight operations. suppliers that drop-ship only low volumes might benefit from a higher degree of integration with the already 105  established freight operations. however, suppliers that drop-ship large volume might benefit from a lower level of integration between its freight and drop-ship operations. limitations and future research  this research is grounded in the context of drop-shipping and hence, might not be generalizable to other contexts. future research might consider other contextual settings that would suggest suppliers to exhibit operational ambidexterity to provide further insights. such an extension of this research would further provide understanding into why and how suppliers become operationally ambidextrous.  in addition, this research is qualitative in nature and thus, provides only an exploratory, rich and deep description of drop-shipping and operational ambidexterity. while this research reveals several themes and their potential interrelationships, future research might wish to complement it by employing a quantitative research approach. for example, survey research could be used to further investigate the potential drivers of drop-shipping and hence, of operational ambidexterity.   lastly, i conducted two case studies that lend themselves for a literal replication. however, to gain further theoretical insights on how suppliers become and manage operational ambidexterity further case studies would be required to allow for a theoretical replication (yin 2009). thus, to extend this research one might consider cases with suppliers that do not have established drop-shipping operations yet to better contrast them against our findings.    106  references  acimovic, j., and graves, s.c. 2015. \"making better fulfillment decisions on the fly in an online retail environment.\" manufacturing & service operations management 17

introduction  frequent stockouts are a major concern for retailers. this is because stockouts often lead to negative consumer behavior (zinn and liu 2001) and substantial financial losses for retailers (aastrup and kotzab 2009). however, within the new reality of omni-channel retailing, described as a seamlessly integrated retail environment of physical and electronic channels (brynjolfsson et al. 2013), retailers have new options to potentially \"save the sale\" in the case of a stockout. following a stockout, a retailer may offer to order the unavailable product online and ship it to either the store or directly to the customer\\'s home. for example, in early 2015, jc penney, a national, mid-range department store in the u.s., began offering free online shipping of unavailable products to the store. thus, in the case of a stockout, jc penney leverages its omni-channel fulfillment operations to provide their customers with products, even though the product is unavailable in the store. this example illustrates that omni-channel retailers might now have the necessary retail service operations to provide consumers with a more timely and convenient stockout recovery than in the past. while retailers might have the necessary service fulfillment operations in place to recover from a stockout, it is important to gain an understanding of how consumers evaluate these services (roth and menor 2003). prior research demonstrates that service failures lead to negative consumer attitudes and behaviors, such as dissatisfaction (e.g. allen et al. 2014), negative word-of-mouth (e.g. lin et al. 2011), or customer complaints (knox and van oest 2014). having a service recovery strategy in place (kelly et al. 1993) provides companies with the opportunity to transform negative consumer attitudes and behaviors into positive ones (bitner et al. 1990). service operations literature specifically stresses the importance of consumers\\' \"fairness\" perceptions when evaluating a company\\'s recovery efforts (craighead et al. 2004). positive post-recovery 116  perceptions can be achieved if a retailer meets consumers\\' recovery expectations through offering the right bundle of recovery strategies. this in turn is likely to translate into more equitable (\"fair\") perceptions leading to improved post-recovery satisfaction levels (e.g. roggeveen et al. 2012).  in the case of a stockout, retailers traditionally had either no or only limited options to recover from such a failure. for instance, a retailer could provide consumers with alternative substitute products (breugelmans et al. 2006) or offer a rain check (kelley et al 1993). however in an omni-channel retail environment, a retailer\\'s operational activities can now be used to recover from a stockout (miller et al. 2000). one interesting issue that emerges within the omni-channel retail environment is whether consumers perceive it as \"fair\" if the retailer leverages its omni-channel fulfillment operations to recover from a stockout. it is also suggested from prior literature that situational factors, such as purchase urgency, might play an important role when investigating consumer responses to stockouts (e.g. zinn and liu 2008; zinn and liu 2001; peinkofer et al. 2015). hence, contextual effects influence whether consumers evaluate a retailer\\'s recovery strategy as more equitable (\"fairer\"). thus, while fulfillment operations now play a new and increasingly important role in stockout recovery these emerging issues warrant further exploration. this is specifically important considering that the majority of retailers still struggle with implementing and managing their omni-channel operations, despite the fact that omni-channel fulfillment is slowly becoming standard (forrester research, inc. 2014).  therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine how omni-channel fulfillment operations can be used to recover from a stockout. more precisely the aim is to investigate (1) how, in the case of a stockout, different attributes of a retailer\\'s omni-channel fulfillment 117  operations impact consumer satisfaction and their evaluation of a retailer\\'s physical distribution service quality (pdsq); (2) how do consumers evaluate these service recovery attributes in terms of perceived \"fairness\"; and, (3) the role the purchase experience\\'s contextual effects have on consumers\\' evaluation of a retailer\\'s stockout recovery strategy. using equity theory (adams 1965), this manuscript implements a series of experimental studies to explore the impact omni-channel fulfillment operations have on consumer satisfaction levels and pdsq evaluations. more precisely, the studies examine if various fulfillment service attributes, such as convenience and speed, positively impact consumer satisfaction after a stockout. to that end, this manuscript will also investigate the underlying mechanisms for \"why\" satisfaction occurs. additionally, i consider the shopping context of the consumer (i.e. whether the consumer needs vs. does not need a particular product). thus, this manuscript will contribute to the growing body of literature examining consumer issues in supply-chain and operations management (e.g. rao et al. 2011b; griffis et al. 2012b). the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows: reviews of the relevant literature pertaining to inventory availability, fulfillment operations, service recovery, and associated supply-chain issues are presented. the manuscript then proceeds by introducing the theoretical framework and research hypotheses. literature review  fulfillment operations  the body of literature focusing on consumer issues in the fields of operations and supply-chain management is still growing. over the last decade, two distinct streams of 118  literature have emerged. the first stream considers investigates inventory management, product distribution, and order fulfillment strategies within an online retailing context (e.g. rabinovich and evers 2003; rabinovich 2004; griffis et al. 2012b; cheong et al. 2015). this body of research focuses on the internal or operational aspect of retail service operations (roth and menor 2003). for instance, researchers investigate whether inventory consolidation (rabinovich and evers 2003) and emergency transshipments (rabinovich 2005) can prevent or improve order fulfillment. they also investigate how trade-offs in actual and signaled order-to-shipment and delivery times impact consumer attitudes (rabinovich 2004). further, this stream of research considers the potential cost trade-offs between various fulfillment strategies, such as inventory holding and transportation costs (e.g. cheong et al. 2015; netessine and rudi 2006; bendoly et al. 2007). overall, this stream of literature argues that retailers should develop and then leverage an online channel to achieve high product availability and fulfillment performance. moreover, implementing an omni-channel supply-chain enables retailers to evaluate different fulfillment strategies in terms of cost and profitability. the second stream focuses on consumers\\' responses to order fulfillment processes and failures, particularly late deliveries (rao et al. 2011b), product returns (griffis et al. 2012a; rao et al. 2014), and stockouts (e.g. dadzie and winston 2007; pizzi and scarpi 2013). this stream highlights the growing importance of consumer-level variables, such as consumer satisfaction (e.g. esper et al. 2003) and perceptions of pdsq (e.g. koufteros et al. 2014). for example, boyer and hult (2006) find that different order fulfillment strategies impact consumer retention differently and rao et al. (2011a) show that the perceptions of a retailer\\'s pdsq positively correlate with consumer satisfaction and retention levels.  119  the second stream specifically highlights the importance of retailers achieving positive consumer pdsq perceptions (e.g. rao et al. 2014; rabinovich and bailey 2004; griffis et al. 2012b). understanding how consumers evaluate a retailer\\'s service operations is key to offering superior retail services (roth and menor 2003). consumers are more satisfied and more likely to re-purchase from a retailer when they perceive a retailer\\'s pdsq performance to be high (rao et al. 2011a). consumer perceptions of pdsq gain further importance when evaluating a stockout recovery within an omni-channel retail context. if a stockout occurs, consumers tend to negatively evaluate a retailer because their pdsq is presumed to be insufficient. however, by leveraging established omni-channel fulfillment operations, retailers might be able to turn this negative situation into a positive pdsq evaluation. since failures in the fulfillment process are likely to result in negative reactions from consumers and may lead to a loss of sales, this stream of research emphasizes the importance of retailers and their respective supply-chain members to provide reliable and exceptional fulfillment services to consumers. inventory availability inventory availability constitutes a key operations performance measure of retail supply-chains (emmelhainz et al. 1991), however poor supply-chain management (dehoratius and raman 2008; ettouzani et al. 2012; raman et al. 2001) may result in stockouts that negatively impact manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. stockouts fall under typical retail operation failures (kelley et al. 1993) and a growing body of literature investigates the potential impact of stockouts for upstream and downstream supply chain members has emerged.  120  research has established that consumers negatively react to retail operation failures (e.g. pizzi and scarpi 2013; kim and lennon 2011; rao et al. 2011b; oflaç et al. 2012). for example, pizzi and scarpi (2013) show that stockouts negatively impact re-patronage behavior and rao et al. (2011b) provide evidence for delivery failures leading to a decrease in the frequency and size of future orders. therefore, retailers need to implement recovery strategies to mitigate these negative reactions. with regard to stockouts, kim and lennon (2011) and breugelmans et al. (2006) argue online retailers should inform their consumers up front about inventory availability. and pizzi and scarpi (2013) suggest that online retailers can mitigate negative consumer responses by taking responsibility for the stockout. these strategies only lessen, but do not fully recover, consumer dissatisfaction following an operational failure. however, within the new reality of omni-channel retailing, retailers have the opportunity to fully recover from a stockout by leveraging their omni-channel fulfillment operations.  to summarize, prior research has contributed to an understanding of how consumers respond to stockouts in a single-channel retail setting. with the growth of online retailing over the past decade, the vast majority of work has been conducted exclusively within an online retailing context (e.g. griffis et al. 2012a; pizzi and scarpi 2013; rao et al. 2011b). a small body of literature has started to explore how consumer dissatisfaction resulting from retail service failures might be mitigated. however, important research opportunities have not yet been addressed, such as how an omni-channel retail environment disrupts and alters traditional consumer behavior and expectations pertaining to stockouts. moreover, extant research has not considered how omni-channel fulfillment operations may help to recover consumer satisfaction following a stockout. thus, there is an opportunity for the service recovery literature to provide 121  further insights with regard to how and why omni-channel fulfillment operations as a recovery strategy can impact consumer satisfaction levels and pdsq evaluations. service recovery a stockout constitutes a service failure, which refers to any service that is unfulfilled, delayed, or does not meet consumer expectations (bitner et al. 1990). service recovery is conceptualized as a firm strategy (hart et al. 1990) that attempts to restore a damaged relationship between a company and a consumer (knox and van oest 2014). however, service failure literature demonstrates that each recovery strategy achieves, if at all, different levels of improved consumer satisfaction. in fact, a strategy\\'s success depends on a series of factors, such as failure type and magnitude (e.g. kelley et al. 1993; smith et al. 1999; blodgett et al. 1997). considering these prior findings, it is of great importance to carefully evaluate which recovery strategies lead to improved consumer satisfaction positive evaluations of a retailers\\' pdsq in the case of a stockout in an omni-channel retail setting. this manuscript integrates the discussed streams of literature and addresses the research gaps outlined above by: (1) extending the conversation of stockouts into an omni-channel retail environment and (2) investigating which omni-channel fulfillment operations are most advantageous to recovering consumer satisfaction and improving a retailer\\'s pdsq perceptions after a stockout. conceptual framework   equity theory (adams 1965) posits that a consumer\\'s response derives from comparing their internal calculation of outcomes to inputs to the perceived ratio of an average consumer\\'s outcomes to inputs. consumer dissatisfaction is than a perceived imbalance or inequity arising 122  from receiving a lower outcome than the average consumer, providing more inputs than the average consumer, or a combination of both (oliver 1980). therefore, according to equity theory, a consumer experiencing a stockout will receive a lower outcome than the average consumer which leads to an imbalance between a consumer\\'s ratio of outcomes to inputs and an average consumer\\'s ratio of outcomes to inputs. this imbalance, or perception of inequity, leads to consumer dissatisfaction (kim and lennon 2011; pizzi and scarpi 2013).  research has positioned equity theory as an applicable lens to study consumer responses to service recoveries (e.g. grewal et al. 2008; smith et al. 1999; roggeveen et al. 2012). this theory has also been applied to studying supply chain failures, such as late deliveries (rao et al. 2011b) and supply chain recoveries, such as returns management (griffis et al. 2012a).  figure 1 was developed to guide this research and is based on the theoretical foundations of equity theory. in general, the framework for this research proposes that a fast and efficient recovery process impact satisfaction levels and pdsq perceptions, with regard to a retailer\\'s omni-channel fulfillment operations aimed at restoring consumers\\' perceived inequity after experiencing a stockout.  figure 3: framework  this research consists of four experimental studies including one pretest and three main studies. the pretest helped develop and refine the experimental stimuli for the main studies and 123  was used to ensure only the variables of interest were manipulated (perdue and summers 1986; knemeyer and naylor 2011).  study 1   this study focuses on developing the foundational relationships between a timely and convenient stockout recovery on consumers\\' equity perceptions. based on these underlying relationships, studies 2 and 3 enhance the baseline model, evaluate other consumer outcome variables, and introduces more sophisticated variations of the proposed relationships. retail evaluations depend, at least partly, on different facets of the recovery process (tax et al. 1998). for the purpose of this research, i am particularly concerned with the dimensions of speed and convenience. speed refers to how fast the recovery strategy is (i.e. next day vs. 9 days) (smith et al. 1999). convenience is a nonmonetary attribute that refers to consumers designating limited effort in order to acquire a product (berry et al. 2002). in this paper, convenience is defined as the location where an (formerly) unavailable product is delivered (i.e. the consumer\\'s home vs. the store).  extant literature demonstrates that successful recovery strategies lead to enhanced consumer satisfaction (allen et al. 2014; roggeveen et al. 2012; tax et al. 1998) and positive company evaluations (e.g. maxham and netemeyer 2002). these positive consumer responses result from repairing the consumers\\' view of equity on the part of the retailer (e.g. roggeveen et al. 2012). according to equity theory (adams 1965), inequality can be restored either through matching or even exceeding the outcome or through minimizing the investment of additional inputs. in the case of a stockout, a retailer can match the outcome by offering consumers who experience a stockout the option of having the product provided through another channel, for instance. during the stockout recovery process, the consumer is likely to 124  invest additional time and effort until the unavailable product is received. in accordance with equity theory (adams 1965), the retailer should try to minimize the additional consumer inputs, such as time and effort to rectify perceived equity imbalances. for example, a retailer could provide a fast recovery to minimize consumer waiting times. the literature suggests a fast recovery is perceived as \"fairer\" by consumers in comparison to a slow recovery (hart et al. 1990; smith et al. 1999). in a stockout situation, a retailer has the opportunity to leverage its omni-channel fulfillment operations to provide a fast recovery from the failure in the primary retail channel by delivering the unavailable product through another channel thereby minimizing the time a consumer invests waiting for the product. hence, consumers are more likely to have higher equity perceptions when the recovery is fast than when it is slow.  similarly, a retailer could offer delivering the unavailable product to a more convenient location to minimize the additional effort a consumer invests during the recovery process. in a stockout situation, a retailer has the opportunity to leverage its omni-channel fulfillment operations to have the (formerly) unavailable product delivered to a more convenient location and thus, minimize the additional effort consumers invest during the recovery process (berry et al. 2002). hence, consumers are likely to have higher equity perceptions when the product is delivered to a more convenient location than when it is delivered to a less convenient location. thus, i hypothesize: h1a: a speedy (slow) recovery leads to a higher (lower) levels of perceived equity. h1b: a more convenient (less convenient) location leads higher (lower) levels of perceived equity.  125  while speed and convenience, when considered individually, are likely to lead to higher perceptions of equity, the complete recovery strategy should be seen as a bundle of resources (smith et al. 1999). according to equity theory (adams 1965), equity can be achieved by minimizing the additional inputs, in terms of time and effort, a consumer invests in the recovery process. minimizing additional inputs can be achieved by providing a speedy recovery and having the product delivered to a more convenient location. building on the discussion of h1a and h1b, i would predict that a slow recovery speed is likely to lead to low equity perceptions because the consumer will have to invest more time. however when considering speed and convenience as a bundle of resources, a consumer\\'s overall additional inputs can be minimized by the retailer and equity can be approximated by offering a more convenient delivery location since consumers. accordingly, the consumer will invest less effort overall even when the recovery is slow.  similar logic applies when the product is delivered to a less convenient location. again, delivering a product to a less convenient location increases consumers\\' time input. however, considering speed and convenience as a bundle of recovery resources (smith et al. 1999), having a speedy recovery but delivering the product to a less convenient location is likely to be perceived as more equitable because overall, the consumer will have to invest less additional time during the recovery process. since, perceived equity depends on how consumers interpret the entire recovery process in terms of speed and convenience, i hypothesize:  h2a: when recovery speed is slow, having the product delivered to a more convenient location will lead to higher levels of perceived equity than when the product is delivered to a less convenient location  h2b: when the product is delivered to a less convenient location, a fast recovery will lead to higher levels of perceived equity than a slow recovery.  126  pretest before the hypotheses were tested in study 1, a pretest was conducted to ensure the validity of our experimental manipulations. for the pretest, i developed a hypothetical shopping scenario following the guidelines of rungtusanatham et al. (2011). in the pre-design stage, i consulted in-store policies of omni-channel retailers to explore the different fulfillment options stores typically provide to consumers in the case of a stockout. based on this review, i identified those retailers who deliver products to a consumer\\'s home or to the store. additionally, retailers differ depending on their speediness of delivery (i.e. next day or 9 days). once i identified these key factors, i developed the written version of the hypothetical shopping scenario. this step involved the careful development of a common and experimental module (rungtusanatham et al. 2011). the common module included all the statements that are constant across all groups and the experimental module included all the statements that varied across experimental groups. the final experimental conditions were reviewed by a total of six experts. integrating their feedback into the experiment enhanced the instructions and scenario clarity. the final experiment for the pretest was a 2 (convenience: delivered to the home vs. to the store) x 2 (speed: next day delivery vs. 9 days delivery) between subjects design, including one control group.  a total of 170 students (61.8% male; mean age of 23.12 years) were recruited from five different business courses at a large, public university in the southern united states. participants received course credit in exchange for participating in the pretest. all participants were randomly assigned (bachrach and bendoly 2011; knemeyer and naylor 2011) to one of the five experimental conditions. 127  to evaluate convenience and speed among the different groups, i excluded our control group from the analysis. i conducted a manova with convenience and speed as the dependent variables, both measured on a 7-point likert-scale (1=strongly disagree; 7=strongly agree), and \"to where\" the product was delivered (home vs. the store) and \"when\" the product was delivered (next day vs. 9 days delivery) as the independent variables. there is a significant main effect for \"to where\" on convenience, f(1,126) =56.34, p<0.001, ƞ2=0.31, indicating that when the product is delivered to the consumer\\'s home (mhome= 6.27) participants evaluate this as being more convenient than if the product is delivered to the store (mstore= 4.21). the main effect for \"when\" on convenience was not significant. there is also a significant main effect for \"when\" on speed, f(1,126) =109.20, p<0.001, ƞ2=0.47, indicating that when the product is delivered the next day (mnext_day = 2.58), participants evaluate this as having to wait less than if the product is delivered in 9 days (m9_days = 5.58). the main effect for \"where\" on speed was not significant at the α = 0.05 level. no significant interaction effects were observed. to evaluate whether participants were aware of their respective experimental condition, a contingency table analysis was conducted (bachrach and bendoly 2011; perdue and summers 1986). the large effect sizes for the convenience condition with χ2=63.36, p<0.001, cramer\\'s v=0.65 and the speed condition with χ2=74.330 p<0.001, cramer\\'s v=0.70 indicate most of the participants were able to identify their respective groups, which supports the validity of our manipulations (miller 2002).  study 1: method study 1 constituted a 2 (convenience: delivered to the home vs. to the store) x 2 (speed: next day delivery vs. 9 days delivery) between subjects design, including one control group and a total of 222 adults from the u.s. participated in the web-based survey via amazon 128  mechanical turk (mturk) (knemeyer and naylor 2011; goodman et al. 2013). participants were randomly assigned to one of the five experimental conditions. the age range of the sample is from 18 to 73, with a mean age of 35.4 years, and approximately 65% of the participants were female. the median combined household income was $40,000 - $49,999, and about 87% reported at least some college education.  study 1: dependent variables and manipulation check measures the outcome variable of interest in study 1 was \"equity\" (smith et al. 1999) consisting of three dimensions: distributive (which evaluates the outcome), procedural (which evaluates the process in which the outcome is achieved), and interactional equity (which refers to employees behavior). appendix a provides a detailed overview of the item descriptions.  to assess whether participants were aware of their respective treatment condition, two one-item measures were used asking participants to indicate to where the tablet would be delivered (to the home or to the store) and when the tablet would be delivered (the next day or in 9 days). additionally, an instructional manipulation check (oppenheimer et al. 2009) was included at the end of the survey to ensure that participant were aware of the instructions. study 1: manipulation checks to assess whether participants were aware of their respective experimental conditions (perdue and summers 1986; bachrach and bendoly 2011), two-way contingency table analyses were conducted. the significance and large effect sizes (cramer\\'s v=0.943 and 0.977; convenience and speed, respectively) are in line with pretest 1 and hence, confirm the validity of our experimental manipulations (miller 2002).  129  study 1: analysis and results  to test h1a, h1b, h2a, and h2b a two-way anova was conducted with speed (next day vs. 9 days) and convenience (home vs. store) as fixed effects and equity was included as the dependent variable. the analysis shows that there is a significant main effect of speed (f(1,176)=7.68; p<0.01, η2 = 0.04) on equity, indicating that consumers exhibit higher perceptions of equity if the recovery is fast (mfast = 6.05) rather than slow (mslow = 5.45). thus, h1a is supported. the main effect of convenience is not significant at the 0.05 level, (f(1,176)=5.49; p=0.053; η2 = 0.02). thus, h1b is only partially supported. no significant interaction effect was revealed.  to test h2a and h2b i build on the anova results by conducting pairwise comparisons of convenience on equity when the recovery speed is slow and speed on equity when the delivery location is less convenient. the results show that for the slow recovery condition, convenience does not enhance perceptions of equity (p = 0.240; mhome = 5.70, mstore = 5.40). thus, h2a is not supported. for the condition when the product is delivered to a less convenient location, speed significantly enhances perceptions of equity (p = 0.08; mnextday = 5.84, m9days = 5.40). thus, h2b is partially supported. study 1: discussion  the findings of study 1 suggest that providing a fast recovery is more essential to achieving higher perceptions of equity than providing a more convenient delivery location. the finding that the recovery attribute of convenience has, in general, only a limited effect on perceptions of equity further supports this interpretation.  130   although these findings provide some insights into which attributes of an omni-channel fulfillment operations may impact consumer perceptions of equity, this study has its limitations. study 1 does not consider other relevant consumer related outcome variables such as satisfaction or perceptions of a retailer\\'s service quality. thus, study 2 introduces post-recovery satisfaction and physical distribution service quality as two new outcome variables. furthermore, study 2 will provide insights into the underlying processes of \"why\" consumers experience post-recovery satisfaction and positive evaluations of a retailer\\'s pdsq. building on study 1, it seems to be the case that consumers evaluate different recovery attributes as more \"equitable\" (fairer) which in turn might then lead to heightened satisfaction levels.  study 2    this study investigates whether consumers\\' post-recovery satisfaction levels and perceptions of a retailer\\'s pdsq are indirectly impacted through their perceptions of equity. equity theory suggests that a consumer\\'s recovery evaluation is a function of previously developed perceptions of equity (adams 1965). these perceptions subsequently translates into enhanced consumer satisfaction (roggeveen et al. 2012) and positive attitudes (oliver 1980). applied to our conceptual model, consumers with high equity perceptions (due to a fast or more convenient recovery) will be more satisfied and will have higher perceptions of pdsq than consumers with low levels of perceived equity (due to a slow or less convenient recovery). for example, roggeveen et al. (2012) provide evidence that equity is the underlying mechanism that restores satisfaction in a recovery involving consumer co-creation. i therefore postulate:  h3: the relationship between speed and convenience and satisfaction and pdsq is mediated by perceived equity, such that: 131  h3a: consumers experiencing a fast recovery will be more satisfied and have higher pdsq perceptions than consumers experiencing a slow recovery, due to higher equity perceptions h3b: consumers having the product delivered to a more convenient location will be more satisfied and have higher pdsq perceptions than consumers having the product delivered to a less convenient location, due to higher equity perceptions. h3c: when recovery speed is slow, having the product delivered to a more convenient location will lead to higher levels of satisfaction and perceived pdsq than when the product is delivered to a less convenient location, due to higher perceived equity. h3d: when the product is delivered to a less convenient location, a faster recovery will lead to higher levels of satisfaction and perceived pdsq than a slow recovery, due to higher perceived equity. study 2: method study 2 also constituted of a 2 (convenience: delivered to the home vs. to the store) x 2 (speed: next day delivery vs. 9 days delivery) between subjects design, including one control group. a total of 261 adults from the u.s. participated in the web-based survey via amazon mechanical turk (mturk) (knemeyer and naylor 2011; goodman et al. 2013). participants were randomly assigned to one of the five experimental conditions. the age range of the sample was from 19 to 76, with a mean age of 36.6 years, and approximately 65.7% of the participants were female. the median combined household income was $40,000 - $49,999, and about 91% reported at least some college education.  study 2: dependent variables and manipulation check measures the dependent variables in study 2 are post-recovery satisfaction (crosby and stephens 1987) and the participant\\'s perception of a retailer\\'s pdsq (koufteros et al. 2014). a retailer\\'s pdsq is operationalized as having three dimensions: timeliness, availability, and condition. the measures were adapted from extant research. timeliness refers to whether the product 132  would be delivered on time; availability refers to whether the retailer is able to provide the product when requested; and, condition refers to whether the product will arrive in good condition. appendix a provides a detailed overview of the two scales used to measure the dependent variables.  study 2: convergent and discriminant validity assessments  convergent and discriminant validity of the dependent measures were assessed through confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) using amos 22.0 for spss. a five-factor model, including satisfaction, timeliness, availability, condition, and equity was estimated. equity was estimated as a second factor model consisting of three dimensions: distributive, procedural, and interactional equity. the cfa fit statistics support our model (hu and bentler 1999): χ2 = 1175.35, df = 392, cfi = 0.93, rmsea = 0.088 (90% confidence interval: 0.082; 0.093), and srmr=0.043.  in support of convergent validity the average-variance extracted (ave) for each factor exceeds 0.5 (fornell and larcker 1981). moreover, all cronbach\\'s alpha (α) values exceed 0.8 (nunally and bernstein 1994). in support of discriminant validity for each pair of factors, the ave exceeded the phi-square correlation (ɸ2) (fornell and larcker 1981). table 1 provides a summary of the standardized loadings and cronbach\\'s α.     133  table 1: cfa results study 2 item standardized loading cronbach\\'s α equity1_distributive 0.97 0.98

2: manipulation checks two-way contingency table analyses were conducted to assess whether participants were aware of their respective experimental conditions (perdue and summers 1986; bachrach and bendoly 2011). the significant and large effect sizes (cramer\\'s v=0.905 and 0.960 for convenience and speed respectively) of the manipulation checks are in line with pretest 1 and study 1. hence, the validity of our experimental manipulations are confirmed (miller 2002). study 2: analysis and results  to assess whether equity would function as a mediator between the recovery attributes and the dependent variables of interest i used process. process is a set of newly established spss macros and is based on an ordinary least square regression path analysis. these macros are suitable to estimate different types of statistical models, including simple mediation and moderation models as well as more advanced moderated-mediation models (hayes 2013). i ran process model 4 and 8 (hayes 2013), which resembles a simple mediation model and an advanced moderated-mediation model. contrary to the traditional view of baron and kenny (1986) who require a significant relationship between the independent and dependent variable to test for mediation, process adopts a more contemporary approach. process establishes mediation based on the only criteria that a significant indirect effect of x on y through a mediating variable m (a x b) exists (zhao et al. 2010; hayes 2009). thus, it is not necessary to first establish a significant relationship between the x and y variables to test for a mediation effect. to assess the significance of indirect effects process uses bootstrap confidence intervals (if 0 is not included in the estimated confidence interval of the indirect effect, mediation can be inferred).  135   first, i estimated a simple mediation model (process model 4) with speed as the sole predictor. the results show that equity functions as a mediator between speed on satisfaction (effect size: 0.41, lower limit: 0.13 and upper limit: 0.69) since 0 is not include in the bootstrap confidence interval. it can be inferred that consumers indicate significantly higher satisfaction levels when the product is delivered the next day vs. in 9 days, due to higher perceived equity. this finding is in line with study 1. similarly, equity also functions as a mediator between speed and timeliness (effect size: 0.33, lower limit: 0.10 and upper limit: 0.58), availability (effect size: 0.21, lower limit: 0.08 and upper limit: 0.41), condition (effect size: 0.15, lower limit: 0.06 and upper limit: 0.26), and overall pdsq (effect size: 0.23, lower limit: 0.03 and upper limit: 0.34) indicating that consumers evaluate a retailer\\'s pdsq significantly higher when the product is delivered the next day vs. in 9 days, due to higher perceptions of equity. based on these results, h3a is supported.   next, i estimated a simple mediation model with convenience as the sole predictor. results indicate that equity does not mediate the relationship between convenience on satisfaction (effect size: 0.25, lower limit: -0.05 and upper limit: 0.58), timeliness (effect size: 0.21, lower limit: -0.04 and upper limit: 0.48), availability (effect size: 0.13, lower limit: -0.02 and upper limit: 0.34), condition (effect size: 0.09, lower limit: -0.02 and upper limit: 0.21), or overall pdsq (effect size: 0.14, lower limit: -0.04 and upper limit: 0.33) since 0 is included in the respective bootstrap confidence intervals. thus, h3b is not supported. table 2

95% bootstrap confidence interval   furthermore, i estimated a mediation model with speed and convenience as the two predictors to test h3c and h3d. results indicate that contrary to our predictions, when recovery is slow, equity does not function as a mediator. accordingly, having the product delivered to a more convenient location does not significantly improve post-recovery satisfaction (effect size: 0.38, lower limit: -0.07 and upper limit: 0.85), timeliness (effect size: 0.31, lower limit: -0.07 and upper limit: 0.68), availability (effect size: 0.20, lower limit: -0.01 and upper limit:

supported. however, in support of h3d, our results show that when the product is delivered to a less convenient location (store), having a fast recovery does lead to significantly higher levels of satisfaction (effect size: 0.55, lower limit: 0.16 and upper limit: 0.97), 137  timeliness (effect size: 0.45, lower limit: 0.09 and upper limit: 0.81), availability (effect size: 0.29, lower limit:

the 95% bootstrap confidence interval study 2: discussion  in line with the findings of study 1, study 2 also supports that in the case of a stockout, in an omni-channel retail environment, a fast recovery plays a more important role in restoring post-recovery satisfaction and positive evaluations of a retailer\\'s pdsq than having the unavailable product delivered to a more convenient location. the data shows that when the product is delivered to a less convenient location higher satisfaction levels and higher perceptions of a retailer\\'s pdsq are due to higher levels of equity. moreover, higher levels of 138  equity can be achieved by providing a fast recovery. hence, it can be concluded that if a retailer does not have the capabilities to deliver the product to a more convenient location, speed might be of essence to achieving higher satisfaction levels and pdsq perceptions.  while the findings of study 2 shed some light on the importance of a fast vs. convenient recovery after a stockout, this study has its limitations. it was specifically surprising that some of the findings were contrary to the predictions based on equity theory. hence, to further contribute to theory (whetten 2009), i contextualized equity theory in study 3 by considering a different shopping context.  study 1 and subsequent study 2 implemented a low purchase criticality scenario (i.e. temporal feelings of involvement that accompany a consumer during a particular shopping situation (richins et al. 1992)) and, hence, provided only limited insights into consumers\\' responses to stockout recoveries. it is suggested that depending on the shopping context (i.e. low vs. high purchase criticality) consumers will evaluate an omni-channel retailer\\'s stockout recovery strategies differently. these limitations will be addressed in study 3 by integrating a high purchase criticality scenario into the experimental design. study 3  this study introduces purchase criticality and explores the boundary conditions of the proposed model. within the context of retailing, purchase criticality or situational involvement is defined as the temporal feelings of involvement that accompany a consumer during a particular shopping situation (richins et al. 1992). extant literature has established, for example, that buying a gift for a friend results in higher purchase criticality compared to buying a product for oneself (clarke and belk 1979). also, the criticality of a purchase (i.e. whether it is needed vs. not needed) has been shown to be an important factor when assessing 139  consumer responses to stockout recovery strategies (zinn and liu 2008, 2001). accordingly, shopping situations that carry a high level of perceived risk or are, highly critical purchases are associated with higher levels of perceived consumer risk (ostrom and iacobbuci 1995).  the service failure literature provides evidence that consumers perceive a service failure as being more severe during high purchase criticality than during low purchase criticality (e.g. ostrom and iacobucci 1995; levesque and mcdougall 2009). this suggests that providing a faster and more convenient recovery from a stockout, particularly within high purchase criticality, is important to restoring equity and consequently achieving high levels of consumer satisfaction and perceptions of a retailer\\'s pdsq.  study 3: method study 3 implemented a 2 (convenience: delivered to the home vs. to the store) x 2 (speed: next day delivery vs. 9 days delivery) between subjects design considering a high purchase criticality context. a control group with a low purchase criticality context was integrated into the experimental design. the low purchase criticality scenario asked participants to imagine they are buying a tablet for themselves whereas the high purchase criticality scenario prompted participants to imagine they are buying a tablet as a birthday gift for their spouse. a total of 274 adults from the u.s. participated in the web-based survey via amazon mechanical turk (mturk) (knemeyer and naylor 2011; goodman et al. 2013). participants were randomly assigned to one of the eight experimental conditions. the age range of the sample was from 19 to 74, with a mean age of 33.9 years, and approximately 50% of the participants were female. the median combined household income was $40,000 - $49,999, and about 90.5% reported at least some college education.  140  study 3: dependent variables and manipulation check measures the dependent variables and manipulation check measures were identical to the ones from study 1 and study 2. as a new manipulation check measure for purchase criticality, study 3 included the 20-item bipolar personal involvement inventory scale (zaichkowsky 1994). study 3: convergent and discriminant validity assessments  convergent and discriminant validity of the dependent measures was assessed through confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) using amos 22.0 for spss. a five-factor model, including satisfaction, timeliness, availability, condition, and equity was estimated. equity was estimated as a second factor model consisting of three dimensions: distributive, procedural, and interactional equity. the cfa fit statistics support our model (hu and bentler 1999): χ2 = 1160.28, df = 392, cfi = 0.93, rmsea = 0.085 (90% confidence interval: 0.079; 0.090), and srmr=0.042.  in support of convergent validity the average-variance extracted (ave) for each factor exceeds 0.5 (fornell and larcker 1981). moreover, all

manipulation checks two-way contingency table analyses were conducted to assess whether participants were aware of their respective experimental conditions (perdue and summers 1986; bachrach and

experimental manipulations (miller 2002). additionally, a one-way anova was conducted to check whether there is a significant difference between the low and high purchase criticality groups. the results indicate that the high purchase criticality condition leads to higher purchase criticality evaluations (mhigh_criticality = 5.56) than the low purchase criticality condition (mlow_criticality = 5.17) with f(1,273) = 14.55 , p < 0.01, η2 = 0.05. study 3: analysis and results  i replicated the analysis of study 2, to assess whether the predictions in terms of speed and convenience on

and upper limit: 0.77), condition (effect size: 0.33, lower limit: 0.12 and upper limit: 0.58), and overall pdsq (effect size: 0.50, lower limit: 0.16 and upper limit: 0.78) since 0 is not included in both bootstrap confidence intervals. this finding is in line with the predictions but contrary to the findings considering a low purchase criticality context. thus, h3b is supported considering a high purchase criticality context.  furthermore, i estimated a mediation model with speed and convenience as the two predictors to test h3c and h3d. in line with the predictions, the results indicate that when recovery is slow, equity does function as a mediator. hence, having the product delivered to a more convenient location does significantly improve post-recovery satisfaction (effect size: 0.97, lower limit: 0.36 and upper limit: 1.62), timeliness (effect size: 0.80, lower limit: 0.25 and upper limit: 1.36), availability (effect size: 0.70, lower limit: 0.26 and upper limit: 1.29), condition (effect size: 0.51, lower limit: 0.17 and upper limit: 0.93), and overall pdsq (effect size: 0.69, lower limit: 0.28 and upper limit: 1.26) due to higher equity perceptions. thus, h3c is supported considering a high purchase criticality context. in support of h3d, the results show that when the product is delivered to a less convenient location (store), having a fast recovery does lead to significantly higher levels of satisfaction (effect size: 1.37, lower limit: 0.76 and upper limit: 1.97), timeliness (effect size: 1.13, lower limit: 0.66 and 145  upper limit: 1.65), availability (effect size: 0.98, lower limit: 0.56 and upper limit: 1.56), condition (effect size: 0.72, lower limit: 0.43 and upper limit: 1.11), and overall pdsq (effect size: 0.97, lower limit: 0.55 and upper limit: 1.39) due to higher perceptions of equity.  study 3: discussion  study 3 highlights the importance of the shopping context (i.e. purchase criticality) when recovering from a stockout. the results provide insights into the appropriateness of using equity theory to investigate stockout recovery. while in study 2, which considered a low purchase criticality context, not all findings followed the predictions according to equity theory but when, considering a high purchase criticality context the results were in line with the predictions (study 3). thus, equity theory seems to be a better theoretical lens to predict consumer responses to failure recovery when purchase criticality is high. in addition, it seems to be more important to consider recovery attributes as bundles of recovery resources under a high purchase criticality context and its associated higher risk (smith et al. 1999). while having the product delivered to a more convenient location vs. a less convenient location the data did not evidence significantly improve satisfaction or pdsq levels when the recovery speed was low considering a low purchase criticality context. however, in a high purchase criticality convenience does have a significant and positive effect on satisfaction and pdsq levels.  general discussion and implications  when considered as a whole, the three studies offer interesting insights especially pertaining to the role that equity plays in affecting post-recovery satisfaction and consumer 146  evaluations of a retailer\\'s pdsq. while the findings of this research, in general, indicate that consumers are more likely to have positive post-recovery satisfaction levels and evaluations of a retailer\\'s pdsq due to higher perceptions of equity after a stockout, this might only apply to specific cases. in study 2 (low purchase criticality) i showed that, in general, equity mediates the relationship between a fast recovery and satisfaction and consumer perceptions of a retailer\\'s pdsq. however, in a low purchase criticality context, the data did not indicate convenience would enhance satisfaction levels and perceptions of pdsq when the recovery is slow, which was contrary to the predictions based on equity theory. this suggests that convenience plays a less important role in affecting post-recovery consumer perceptions in a low purchase criticality context. also, in a low purchase criticality context and with its associated low risk, simply providing a fast recovery might be evaluated as \"fair\" enough leading to higher satisfaction levels and perceptions of pdsq. however, in the case of a high purchase criticality context which is associated with high risk, retailers should invest more effort in the recovery process by considering speed and convenience as a bundle of resources for the recovery process. taken together the studies provide insights under which conditions equity serves as an important driver and thus, highlights how consumers perceive specific omni-channel fulfillment attributes when utilized to recover from a stockout situation. theoretical implications and future research this research makes several important contributions to the literature (see table 7 for a summary). this manuscript spans the research areas of operations and marketing by investigating how omni-channel fulfillment operations can impact consumer perceptions. specifically, through a series of experiments i highlight the importance of a retailer\\'s omni-channel fulfillment operations for service recovery within an omni-channel retail environment. 147  more precisely, i show how omni-channel fulfillment operations can be used to recover from a stockout situation. thus, this research specifically contributes to the growing literature stream associated with consumer issues in operations and supply chain management, which stresses the importance of operations management in creating end-consumer value (flint and mentzer 2006).  table 7: summary of contributions to the literature current literature contribution to the literature call for more integrated investigations of managerial processes in both marketing and operations/supply chain management (e.g. esper et al. 2010; stank et al. 2012; jüttner et al. 2007). provides insights for stockout recovery situations and highlights the importance of research at the intersection of operations/supply chain management and marketing. research investigates behavioral responses to service failures more generally (e.g. kelley 1993, roggeven 2012). considers pdsq as an outcome variable to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how various consumer market segments perceive a retailers omni-channel fulfillment operations in the case of a stockout recovery.  provides a deeper understanding of the role omni-channel fulfillment operations for a service failure recovery. consumer response to out-of-stock research has predominantly focused on single channel retailing (e.g. zinn and liu 2001, 2008, peinkofer et al. 2015). extends the consumer response to out-of-stock literature by considering the new omni-channel environment.                                                     equity theory has been shown to be appropriate to study service failure recovery in marketing (e.g. grewal et al. 2008; smith et al. 1999; roggeveen et al. 2012).  provides evidence for the suitability of equity theory to explore stockout recovery. identifies a boundary condition of equity theory since the theory is does only explain higher satisfaction and positive evaluations of a retailer\\'s pdsq for specific \"bundles\" of recovery attributes.   from a theoretical perspective, i was able to show that equity is the driving force behind restoring post-recovery satisfaction levels and achieving positive consumer perceptions 148  of a retailer\\'s pdsq. more specifically, i was able to show that depending on the bundle of recovery attributes and the shopping context, equity might or might not be the driving force impacting consumers\\' post-recovery evaluations. consumers are likely to evaluate different recovery strategies as being more or less \"fair\". supported by the findings of this research, some recovery strategies do not significantly impact consumers\\' fairness perceptions and hence, their satisfaction and evaluations of a retailer\\'s pdsq. for example, i failed to show that equity mediates the relationship between convenience on satisfaction and pdsq when purchase criticality is low. in addition, purchase criticality may present a boundary condition of equity theory and future research is needed to firmly establish these boundary conditions. for example, future research should explore why equity theory seems to be more appropriate when explaining consumer responses to stockout recovery when the purchase criticality is high. conversely, research is also needed to better understand why in a low purchase criticality convenience does not have a significant impact on satisfaction levels and pdsq evaluations. additionally, this research contributes to the literature that investigates how consumers respond to stockouts. historically, this body of work has exclusively focused on exploring consumer responses to stockouts in a single channel setting (e.g. zinn and liu 2008; pizzi and scarpi 2013). however, with the emergence of omni-channel retailing, firms now have new options in how they handle stockouts. this research extends the current understandings of consumer responses to stockouts by considering supply chain focused psychological variables in an omni-channel retail context. specifically, by introducing pdsq as an outcome variable, this study further enhances prior research investigating how consumers evaluate a retailer\\'s pdsq capabilities to the contextual setting of a stockout recovery. 149   while considering supply chain-focused psychological variables provides insight into how consumers evaluate an omni-channel retailer\\'s fulfillment operations, it does not provide insights into actual consumer behaviors. thus, future research should integrate actual consumer behaviors to see how stockout recovery strategies influence other important variables, such as shopping frequency and average money spent on subsequent shopping trips.  furthermore, this research considered how omni-channel retailers can leverage recovery attributes from a stockout in a brick-and-mortar environment and thus, the findings might not be generalizable to online stockouts. since stockouts are also likely to occur within the online retail environment, future research should investigate which recovery attributes are most effective to recover from an online stockout. for consumers experiencing a stockout in a brick-and-mortar store a fast recovery seems to be essential in improving satisfaction levels but consumers experiencing an online stockout might prefer different recovery attributes and evaluate a fast recovery as less important since they were already willing to wait for the product to be shipped.  however, this research only considered two different recovery attributes (speed and convenience). based on prior findings (forrester research, inc. 2014), recovery strategies that rely on shipping products tend to increase costs. this additional cost needs to be considered when developing and implementing a stockout recovery strategy. therefore, future research should incorporate other important recovery attributes to allow a better assessment of how consumers evaluate an omni-channel retailer\\'s recovery efforts.   in addition, esper et al. (2003) find that online consumer satisfaction levels might also be impacted by the selection of the 3pl carrier. hence, future research might also want to 150  incorporate how brick-and-mortar consumers evaluate a retailers\\' stockout recovery efforts based on the carrier selection delivering the product. managerial implications within the omni-channel retail environment, consumers\\' expectations around a retailer\\'s omni-channel capabilities are steadily increasing (forrester research, inc. 2014). 45% of consumers indicate that in the case of a stockout they would very likely take advantage of having the unavailable product shipped to their home; however, only 21% indicated that they would be willing to have it shipped to the store (forrester research, inc. 2014). it is important for managers to understand that not all recovery efforts are evaluated by consumers equally and will lead to positive post-recovery satisfaction levels. managers need to gain an understanding of the recovery attributes that are most valued by their consumers in order to increase consumer satisfaction and evaluations of their pdsq post-stockout. thus, manager could use the insights from this research to determine which recovery strategies might be evaluated by their consumers as \"fair\" to ensure that after a stockout occurs and consumers experience dissatisfaction, satisfaction levels can be improved through offering the appropriate recovery strategy.  also, big data and data analytics play an important role in implementing efficient and effective omni-channel fulfillment operations (ferguson 2013). for example, massey\\'s professional outfitters was able to improve its efficiency and customer service by consolidating all its data from various channels into one platform (berthiaume 2015). managers can now leverage insights from big data and predictive analytics to anticipate which consumers are in need (high purchase criticality) or not in need (low purchase criticality) for a product. the tools to make predictions about consumers\\' purchase are emerging. for example, 151  target was able to use consumer buying data to predict whether a female consumer was pregnant (duhigg 2012). knowing this type of information enables managers to adjust their stockout recovery strategy based on the consumers\\' shopping context, ensuring that the \"best\" recovery strategy is offered and post-recovery satisfaction levels are achieved.  for managers, this research shows that providing a fast stockout recovery is key in achieving higher post-recovery satisfaction levels and consumer perceptions of a retailer\\'s pdsq. hence, managers should prioritize their investments and developments in terms of their omni-channel fulfillment capabilities to offer a fast stockout recovery. omni-channel retailers could develop a ship-from-store program to provide online consumers who experience a stockout with the desired product in a timely manner. for instance, in early 2013, macy\\'s announced that it would be dedicating an additional 200 stores by the end of the year for the purpose of fulfilling online orders (ryan 2014). and, in fact, 57% of retailers cite a shorter delivery time to customers as the most important reason for why these retailers would develop a ship-from-store program (forrester, inc. 2014).       152  references  aastrup,

obtained a holistic understanding of the importance and impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations for successful retail supply chain management. by considering three different echelons in the supply chain (supplier, retailer, and consumer) and employing different methodological approaches each essay by itself provided interesting insights and contributions. however, taken as a whole, several grand findings and contributions of this dissertation to understanding omni-channel fulfillment operations emerged.    in a grand scheme this dissertation provides evidence that across the supply chain the impacts of omni-channel fulfillment operations are mixed but interconnected. while some supply chain members (i.e. retailers and end-consumers) seem to benefit from omni-channel fulfillment operations overall, other supply chain members (i.e. suppliers) seem to be facing significant operational challenges. for example, in essay one, i was able to establish that at least some retailers financially and operationally benefit from omni-channel fulfillment operations, furthermore, i showed that end-consumers and their individual shopping context also play an important role when investigating omni-channel fulfillment operations and should not be neglected. specifically, this research revealed that, in the case of a stockout recovery, the perception of \"fairness\" is a driver of positive consumer evaluations of a retailer\\'s omni-channel fulfillment capabilities. however, essay two highlights the potential operational challenges that suppliers might experience when establishing omni-channel fulfillment capabilities.  future research might therefore wish to explore another aspect of omni-channel fulfillment operations which spans across different members of the supply chain to further strengthen the mixed impacts. for example, it would be interesting to uncover how omni-161  channel returns management will impact the different supply chain members. while consumers might perceive a retailers omni-channel return capabilities as positive, retailers and suppliers alike might struggle with developing the appropriate processes leading to new tensions and operational challenges in the reverse retail supply chain.  in addition, this research indicates that it is essential for supply chain members to become operationally ambidextrous to succeed in the omni-channel retail environment. this research supports the notion that retailers and suppliers refine already established fulfillment operations while simultaneously establishing new fulfillment operations. in the case of the retailers, i was able to provide evidence that depending on the retail segment, retailers appear to demonstrate positive financial and operational performance outcomes due to being operationally ambidextrous. in a similar vein, suppliers also exhibit operationally ambidextrous tendencies. within the context of drop-shipping, suppliers will refine existing operational activities while simultaneously developing new drop-shipping operations. hence, this dissertation provides evidence of the existence and necessity of operational ambidexterity in two different research settings. this dissertation opens up the dialogue for more exploration of the operational ambidexterity phenomenon. the phenomenon is fairly new in the operations and supply chain management domain and has only received very limited attention. future research will be necessary to shed even more light on the relationship of operational ambidexterity and performance. specifically, future research might further investigate its impact on operational performance. while this research introduced operational performance as a new outcome variable, the statistical support was rather weak. thus, future research might focus on studying when a firm might gain operational efficiencies from becoming operationally ambidextrous 162  and when not. thus, specifically longitudinal research designs might be appropriate for future research endeavors. building on the previous conversation, this dissertation also highlights that operational ambidexterity and the impacts thereof are more nuanced. for retailers, i was able to identify that the respective retail segments and their associated environmental characteristics play an important role for the potential positive impacts of operational ambidexterity on retail firm performance. also, the availability of resources appeared to constitute an interesting boundary condition. in addition, from a more internal perspective drop-shipping volume might constitute a boundary condition specifically as it relates to how to manage operational ambidexterity. hence, environmental factors and other firm characteristics may constitute important boundary conditions and warrant further exploration to gain a better understanding. it might be interesting to apply this research to other retail specific contexts and even other industries which are characterized by their individual environments. also, more research is needed to better understand how operational ambidexterity is managed. while this research offers some new insights concerning the debate of structural integration or separation future research might consider additional conditions when it is more beneficial to structurally integrate or separate. this type of extension would allow to uncover additional nuances of the impacts of operational ambidexterity.  moreover, this dissertation provides a more theoretical understanding of operational ambidexterity. while the limited operational ambidexterity literature has addressed the phenomenon from the perspective of theory testing, this dissertation employed an exploratory perspective to contribute to the understanding how operational ambidexterity is reached and managed. specifically, this dissertation indicates that exploration needs to be \"triggered\" by an 163  external event and that exploration eventually turns into exploitation. however, this finding is specific to the context of suppliers and drop-shipping and might differ depending on other contexts or supply chain members. future research might for example focus on gaining more theoretical insights by focusing on retailers. retailers are standing under the continuous pressure of meeting end-consumer expectations and hence, might exhibit a different patter of how to manage operational ambidexterity. lastly, this dissertation stresses the importance of how operational activities create value to end-consumers. the literature only recently gained traction on considering the value that operations and supply chain management activities has on end-consumers. this notion will gain even more importance within the omni-channel retail environment, where not only retailers but also suppliers stand in direct contact with end-consumers. in particular, this dissertation highlights how different attributes (speed and convenience) of omni-channel fulfillment operations can lead to positive consumer evaluations in the case of a stockout recovery. thus, this research contributes to the evolving dialogue on how consumer insights provide valuable insights for retail supply chain strategy.  more research is needed in the future to gain a better and more nuanced understanding of the value that consumer insights offer to retail supply chain strategy. this is especially important considering that supply chains are perceived to be consumer driven. therefore, future research should explore additional supply chain and operations management activities and how these may create end-consumer value. for example, it might be interesting to investigate how omni-channel return management activities impact consumers.   164  vi. appendix                             165          166   '},\n",

customer expectations and economic performance  gerald lang bem bordeaux management school, france ecole polytechnique preg-crg, france gerald.lang@bem.edu    abstract:  increasingly, store-based retailers are opening an additional online sales channel and becoming multi-channel retailers. the integration of these different channels raises the question how to redefine the strategic marketing elements and the operations, as the two channels have different constraints and require different competences. this multi-channel retailing has major impacts on the operations and the supply-chain management. order fulfillment for the customers using the different sales channels is a key challenge, as customers are directly impacted from the performance of this process. in this paper, we will highlight the different strategic elements and operational challenges to be addressed by a multi-channel retailer. in order to evaluate the match between a fulfillment system and a multi-channel business model, we propose a framework analyzing the overall performance of different fulfillment systems regarding the two dimensions customer expectations and economic performance.  key words: multi-channel, retail, fulfillment, distribution \\xa0rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  2  introduction a growing number of traditional store-based retailers are becoming multi-channel retailers by opening an additional online-channel to offer their customers multiple ways of buying and interaction. at the same time, former pure online-retailers are opening stores or physical pick-up points to allow their customers physical interaction and product pick-up. multi-channel retailing got primary attention principally in the field of multi-channel marketing (e.g. wirtz, 2008). marketing literature and scholarly research address multi-channel marketing mainly focusing on customer behavior on the one side (e.g. venkatesan et al, 2007) and the conflicts between channels on the other side (e.g. falk et al, 2007; avery et al, 2009). several authors (e.g. schröder, 2005; schobesberger, 2007; heinemann 2008, 2009) analyze different multi-channel strategies and implications on a retailers\\' marketing mix.  whereas operational implications of online retailing have received attention since the end of the 1990s (e.g. turban et al, 2009; swaminathan & tayur, 2003), specific analysis of operational implications of multi-channel retailing remains scarce. agatz et al (2008) reviewed the specific supply chain management issues of internet fulfillment in a multi-channel environment. they identified an important number of topics relevant for e-fulfillment, but recognized that there are only very few dedicated models on multi-channel retailing.  multi-channel retailers with different business models are using different fulfillment systems to deliver the products to their customers: the online shop of the french retailer fnac (cultural and electronics products), fnac.com, started its online activity completely separated from its store activity, with different warehouse locations and fulfillment organizations. they gradually integrated their logistics activities and are operating today a fully integrated warehouse, preparing deliveries for the stores as well as for the individual online customers. tesco.com, the online shop of the major uk retailer tesco, prepares the customer\\'s orders exclusively in the tesco store next to the customer (smith & sparks, 2009). so does monoprix.fr, the online shop of the french city-center supermarket chain monoprix. these observations suggest that a specific multi-channel business model may induce a specific, most suitable fulfillment system. if this is the case, it should then be possible to evaluate how a fulfillment system fits a given business model.  rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  3  from an operational point of view, fulfillment systems have to be mainly time- and cost-efficient. from a strategic marketing point of view, the fulfillment system has to be able to meet the customers\\' expectations created by the chosen business model. we therefore propose to develop a qualitative framework to evaluate how a specific multi-channel fulfillment system matches the business model of multi-channel retailers both in terms of the expectations of their customers on the one hand and the economic performances on the other hand. this framework should serve as basis for further empirical studies. our paper is organized in two parts: in the first part, we will highlight the main characteristics of multi-channel retailing and present the major elements of the retailers\\' strategy, the retail mix, which have to be adapted to a multi-channel retailing strategy. 1 we then will explore the specific operational challenges to be faced when operating a multi-channel activity.  this first part will be completed with the presentation of the five major multi-channel fulfillment systems used to deliver products to the customers. in the second part, we will propose a qualitative analysis framework in order to evaluate the overall performance of a given fulfillment system, combining the two dimensions \\'customer expectations\\' and \\'economic performance\\'. the parameters of the framework as well as its applications will be based on the analysis of the strategic and operational challenges developed in the first part. applying the analysis framework to the five major fulfillment systems leads us to discuss how each of the systems impacts the different parameters. we conclude our paper presenting managerial implications and suggested future research avenues to provide evidence if our framework is valid for our purpose.  methodology our analysis is based on the one hand on our longitudinal industry observation of retailers\\' practices, completed with the analysis of company information and press articles. moreover,                                                  1 in our paper, we will concentrate on multi-channel retailers operating at least several physical stores and an online sales channel under the same brand and with the same types of products. moreover, we focus on the distribution of physical products, as dematerialized products do not need a physical distribution. we exclude as well specific configurations (which may nonetheless be dominant in particular sectors), like delivery from manufacturers or \\'complex assortments\\' (de koster, 2002) with bulky items and temperature sensitive goods. rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  4  we conducted a series of interviews with french and uk senior operations managers and consultants in the retail sector. this observation allowed us to identify five major multi-channel fulfillment systems. to be able to evaluate these fulfillment systems regarding the two dimensions \\'economic performance\\' and \\'customer expectations\\', we have to identify the relevant parameters to integrate into our proposed framework. to do so, we analyzed marketing and operations general literature and scholarly research. exploration of the main strategy elements and operational challenges suggests number of parameters, indicating economic performance and customer expectations. we completed the identified parameters for evaluating customer expectations with dimensions from the servqual and netqual scales, measuring service quality perception from the customers. these parameters of our framework will be the dependent parameters, whereas the analyzed fulfillment systems will be the independent parameters. the exploration of the strategy factors and economic performances in the first part will allow us to apply the framework to the different fulfillment models by assessing the chosen performance parameters for each of the fulfillment systems. this shall provide a global evaluation for the each of the analyzed fulfillment systems.  strategy factors in multi-channel retailing the objective of this chapter is to summarize the context of multi-channel retailing as well as the main drivers for customer expectations and economic performances, which will enable us to identify the relevant parameters to use in our proposed framework. we will first present the main characteristics of multi-channel retailing. we then will investigate how the business model of a multi-channel retailer, characterized by different elements of the retail mix, will have to be adapted to a multi-channel strategy. an exploration of the major operational challenges for a multi-channel retailer will conclude this chapter.  multi-channel retailing: characteristics & customer behavior worldwide retailing is still dominated by the traditional store retailing, as 95% of food retailing and 80% of non-food retailing is realized through physical store-based retailers (dioux & dupuis, 2009), and online channels still represent only a small part of the total sales of the retailers. nevertheless, the motivation to open online sales-channels is strong due to the fact that e-commerce is realizing important annual turnover growth rates of about 30% for the rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  5  last few years, whilst most other retail forms stay stable or even decline. it is therefore interesting for a store retailer to invest in the creation of an additional online sales channel.  to implement a multi-channel strategy, retailers have to decide how to adapt their business model by adjusting the elements of the retail mix. at the same time, they have to face and resolve numerous operational challenges. in multi-channel retailing, customers expect at least the same level of service, counsel, and information on every channel (cf. heinemann, 2008). they expect to have identical customer loyalty programs across all channels, to be able to pay and pick up in the shop a product ordered on the web site, or to be able to return and exchange a product bought on the web in a store (berman & thelen, 2004). this channel hopping, which is a legitimate desire from a customer\\'s point of view, may nevertheless prove to be very difficult to implement for the retailer (vanheems, 2009). at the same time, online shoppers transfer their perception and experiences from a physical store to the website of the same brand and vice versa. customers tend to transpose a bad experience in one channel to the other channels of the same distributor (heinemann, 2008). as soon as their expectations are not fulfilled, they may adapt their purchasing habits, in the worst case stop buying with this retailer at all. it is therefore vital for a multi-channel retailer to make sure that every channel always meets the same level of expectations of the customers.  multi-channel retail mix  the retail mix consists of the mix of variables, including geographical location, merchandising, communication, price, services, product range and the personnel, which form the overall strategic marketing components of a retailing activity. it is the right mix of all these factors which determines if a retail concept is viable and successful. compared to a store retailer, the online sales channel is not only a new channel, but rather a new business model, where experiences from the traditional (brick and mortar) store channel may not be valid any more (heinemann, 2008). decisive success factors in a store like store location, sales personnel and material management in the shop are not the same success factors in an online sales channel. retailers which decide to open an e-commerce activity beside their existing store sales channel have to make sure that the co-existence of the two sales channels is working well. they have to decide how to adapt the different elements of the retail mix to each channel, rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  6  which product strategy to chose, which prices to apply, how to maintain a consistent image across the channels or what role to assign to each channel, to name a few (cf. berman & evans, 2009). we will briefly describe the major issues of some of the most important variables of the retail mix, assessing their relevance and importance in the store, the online channel and the multi-channel strategy. product mix the product mix is the major variable determining the activity of a retailer. it establishes if a retailer is specialized in selected product categories or a generalist. if a store based retailer opens an additional online channel, he has to decide which product mix he offers on this new channel. he can offer the identical product mix, a combination or part of his existing product mix or a completely different additional product mix on the new channel. location of the stores a physical store\\'s success is to a great extend influenced by its location. in order to determine if the location can attract the store\\'s target customers, a store based retailer has to analyze socioeconomic data, transport access, mix of competitors, costs and regulation issues. these parameters, decisive for a physical store, have generally no influence on a pure online sales channel, as access to the websites is independent from a geographical location. in a multi-channel strategy, however, the store location remains important; the density of the store network can be an important factor for offering store pick-up, returns and after sales services in the stores for their online customers. pricing the pricing policy applied in a store may take into consideration the environment of the store (socioeconomic characteristics of the geographical catchment area) and the price levels of the local competitors. such a local pricing policy which can be applied in a store is incompatible with the global price transparency in an online channel and the exposure to price comparisons. the pricing policy of a multi-channel retailer encounters specific difficulties: the global price transparency on the internet, the specific cost structures of the store and the online channel, rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  7  the existence of specific offers and the different means of payment render it difficult to apply a consistent pricing policy across all channels. especially the price transparency makes it difficult for a retailer to offer different prices for the same product on different sales channels. service, store pick-up and return a multi-channel service offer can be composed of special delivery options (delivery speed, delivery timing, information on order status), the exchange policy, return policy, refunding, after sales service, payment options and consumer credits. multi-channel retailers can offer either to deliver the order to the customer\\'s home or to let the customer pick-up the order in one of the stores. this service allows the customer to pick up the order whenever he likes, even sooner than with home delivery.2 allowing customers in-store return or exchange can avoid the cost and time of returning via mail. at the same time, this offers an important possibility for the retailer to create a personal contact between the client and the sales personnel to increase customer loyalty and to generate additional sales. personnel the sales personnel play a decisive role in stores. they welcome clients, provide counsel and advice and can influence sales. their behavior and attitude contribute in an important way to the atmosphere and ambiance of the store and its concept.  this important parameter in a store is irrelevant in a pure online channel, except for telephone hotline contacts or the delivery service personnel. in a multi-channel strategy, however, the store personnel have to be able to orient and counsel the client using different channels. it is very important for the client not to perceive any differences or barriers between the channels.  operational challenges of multi-channel retailing in general, the operational organization of a retailer is mainly focused on efficient store replenishment, lowering costs and shortening the product turnover time.                                                  2 in case of unavailable items, the retailer can chose to send the missing items directly to the customer and only reserve the available items in the store for pick-up. in this case, the customer experience will be negative, as the customer\\'s decision to pick up his order in the store can\\'t be fulfilled.   rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  8  to offer an online channel to its customers, a retailer has to be able to manage its operations in a very different way from its physical store activity. e-fulfillment may be considered as one of the most expensive and critical operations of internet retailers (de koster, 2002), logistics and stock management becoming core competencies (benghozi, 2001). keeping stock of a high number of different references, making it available, picking and packing, sending and delivering quickly at a low cost are the numerous constraints to respect. in the following, we will present and discuss the main operational issues, which are decisive for the overall performance of the multi-channel retailing. product availability product availability is one of the most important parameters for customer satisfaction (browne, 2009). a store customer usually can compare the products present in the store. availability is indicated through the simple presence of a product in the store shelve. a customer can ask the sales personnel if there is any stock of the product or when it will be available again. an online client needs to have all this information indicated on the website together with the product information. the online channel offers the possibility to display the remaining stock of a chosen product, or even, in a multi-channel context, the remaining stock and the location of the store where the product is available for testing, purchasing or withdrawal. displaying the availability of products or the delay of their replacement is an important marketing tool impacting the sales and influencing customer satisfaction.  stock keeping stores usually receive deliveries either directly from the manufacturer or from one or several logistics platforms with either warehousing or cross-docking function. as online orders may consist of different products, composing the orders from different warehouse locations may prove to be difficult and inefficient in terms of cost and delivery time. a central warehouse and fulfillment center may therefore, at a first view, be more adapted to the online channel. however, multi-channel retailers may as well pick the items for an online order directly in the stores. for an online order, the retailer has some flexibility where from he delivers the products to his customers, as he can use multiple stock locations and therefore offer a wider product range than the one contained in a single warehouse, as multiple channels may share their rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  9  inventories. in-store inventories can therefore be available for online customers\\' orders (agatz et al, 2008). centralizing stock allows easier monitoring of the stock levels for different products. if a retailer is serving its online clients (totally or partially) from stock in the stores, the overall stock level on these different locations is difficult to monitor. this is the same problem for multi-channel retailers who offer the possibility to their customers to order online and withdraw the product in a nearby store. as information on product availability is a crucial parameter for the customers buying decision, the accuracy of the stock level information is very important. order taking and fulfillment in an online channel, the customer enters the type and number of products he wants to acquire and enters the payment information (usually done by credit cards), the online channel therefore becomes a self-service channel (falk et al, 2007). all this information entered by the customer triggers the order preparation and fulfillment process. retailers once delivering their stores from centralized distribution centers (often with complete boxes or pallets) have to re-think the way orders are prepared, as their organizations are not designed for small individual customers\\' orders. they must therefore be reorganized to treat these orders (de koster, 2002), implementing a process of single item picking and packing. as mentioned above, another option for the retailer is to pick the items in the stores, where the products are available on the shelves, and to prepare the order in the shops. furthermore, orders may be consolidated from multiple stock locations (for example from a warehouse and a store), which needs a specific process. the more complex the fulfilment process is organized, the more difficult it becomes to respect the quality and efficiency of this process. delivery to the customer besides the availability of the product, the different delivery options for a product are an important parameter for the online channel client. different delivery service levels offered like delivery in 24 hours, delivery to a pick-up point, national post service etc. are becoming a product differentiation factor of the retailer. rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  10  delivery to the customers\\' homes, which is a distinctive element of an online channel, implies to deal with cost and organizational issues. the usually small transactions have to be managed and delivered in an efficient way, while respecting the promised delivery timing. the costs of the home delivery can be totally or partially paid by the customer. this becomes an important parameter of choice for the client, as no direct delivery costs appear in the store channel. on the other hand, the costs of delivery can be used as a marketing tool for special offers (\"your next order free of charge\") or minimum order amounts (\"delivery free of charge for every order above 100 euros\"). delivery becomes therefore a service parameter, a price parameter and a promotional parameter. reverse logistic store customers can usually see, touch and try the goods before purchasing. returns are limited and very often linked to an exchange of the product, where the returned product is put back into the shelves. defect products are reimbursed. as online customers cannot see, touch and try the products, online retailers usually offer good conditions for the customer to return the products they don\\'t like (due to legal and regulatory obligations, but as well as part of their customer service offer).  return handling must be quick in the eyes of the customers, either to get a product exchange or to get reimbursed and the customer account re-credited. the process must as well be efficient as it is a very manual process and impacts the stock management of the returned products (min et al, 2006). a physical store channel can be an easy way in the customer\\'s eyes to return the products. multi-channel fulfillment systems  to operate the multi-channel strategy, retailers have to set up a fulfillment system to deliver products to the customers. this fulfillment system, organizing the process from order intake to delivery to the customer, has to match the business model and to reply to the operational challenges. industry players are using different fulfillment systems, and several authors suggest typologies of fulfillment schemes, focusing on the locus of order preparation (de koster, 2002; durand, 2008). multi-channel retailing per se intends to offer the clients the choice where and how to order and where and how to get the products delivered. rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  11  the major choice for the client is to shop in the store or shop online. if shopping online, the client can furthermore opt for delivery at home or pick up his products in one of the retailer\\'s stores.  the retailer has to set up a fulfillment system able to respect the client\\'s choice of the delivery mode, either by creating a new logistics infrastructure, or using the existing one, by adapting the existing processes. in order to be able to analyze the fulfillment systems from a customer expectation\\'s perspective, we decided to distinguish the fulfillment systems by the delivery option chosen by the customer: clients may either choose the direct home delivery for their purchases completed on the online channel or choose to pick up their purchased items in a physical store of the retailer. this in-store pick-up is a delivery option only multi-channel retailers can offer and which may be chosen to 30-40% of the customers at some multi-channel retailers (berman & thelen, 2004). a client going into a store in order to buy a product, searches, compares, picks the product out of the shelve and pays the product. single-channel store shoppers may therefore not be affected by the multi-channel fulfillment organization. 1. direct home delivery direct home delivery can be completed either by the retailer\\'s own delivery organization, a delivery logistics provider or via an external pick-up point network3. before entering in this \\'delivery pipeline\\', products have to be picked, prepared, packed and expedited, which can be done either in a central warehouse or distribution center, in a store, or in multiple locations (central warehouse and one or more stores).                                                   3 we consider a delivery via an external pick-up-point network (usually neighborhood shops linked to a network which offers the retreat of parcels for the clients of different retailers) like a home delivery, as the fulfillment process is quite identical, with a delivery of (sometimes pre-sorted) parcels to the pick-up point network\\'s injection hub. although this is influencing the ease of access, this way of delivery cannot provide a contact with the retailer as in his own store.  rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  12  1.1 direct delivery from central warehouse  picking, preparation and packing of ordered items can be done from a central warehouse stocking the products (figure 1.1). this central warehouse can either be a purpose-built entity to serve exclusively the online channel or the existing warehouse for the store operations (in which case the processes in the warehouse have to be adapted).  1.2 direct delivery from a store  picking, preparation and packing of the ordered items can be done inside a physical store out of the shelves. in this case, operators pick the products into a specific order preparation cart from the shelves and then pack and send the completed order to the customer (figure 1.2).   1.3 direct delivery after multi-stock consolidation  if the desired articles of an order are not available in one place, picking of the ordered items has to be done in a central warehouse as well as inside a physical store from the shelves. the picked items have then to be consolidated, prepared and packed in one site (figure 1.3). in some cases, the multichannel  figure 1.1: direct delivery from central warehouse figure 1.2: direct delivery from a store figure 1.3: direct delivery after multi-stock consolidation rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  13  retailer may opt for sending the order in two different parcels, to avoid the costs and delay of the consolidation.  2 client pick-up in the store a customer ordering online may choose to pick up his products in one of the retailer\\'s stores. in this case, products have to be picked, prepared, packed and kept ready for pick-up in the store. 2.1 direct in-store order preparation  if all the products of the customer\\'s order are available in the store chosen by the customer to pick-up, the picking, preparation and packing of the order can be done immediately in the store (figure 2.1).     2.2 in-store order consolidation from multiple stocks  if some of the products of the customer\\'s order are not available in the store chosen by the customer for pick-up, the unavailable items must be ordered from the central warehouse (or other stores) to complete the order. the preparation and packing of the order can be done only after consolidation of all items in the store (figure 2.2). (a specific case of this in-store order consolidation can be a complete order  preparation in a central warehouse sent to the store only to be picked up by the customer, without further adding any product in the store).  figure 2.1: direct in-store order-preparation figure 2.2: in-store order consolidation from multiple stocks rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  14  the analysis framework in this part, we will first determine the parameters to integrate in our proposed framework. we then will apply this framework to the five abovementioned fulfillment systems and discuss the results. we will conclude this part discussing the limitations of the framework, suggestions for further research and managerial implications.  customer expectations and economic performance having analyzed the main strategy factors and operational challenges, and identified the five major fulfillment systems, we now have to determine the parameters to include into our proposed framework in order to evaluate these fulfillment systems. the different fulfillment systems lead to different levels of complexity, of costs and of product availability and therefore different levels of customer satisfaction and economic performance. to explore how a fulfillment system fits a given business model, we have to evaluate the overall performance of the different multi-channel fulfillment systems, combining the two angles of analysis:  on the one hand, we analyze to which extend a given fulfillment system is able to meet the customer expectations. on the other hand, we analyze the economic performance of each model. in our proposed framework, we will confront the different fulfillment systems to several parameters which are relevant for the customer expectations and the economic performance. the fulfillment systems may be considered as the independent variables of our analysis, whereas the different parameters of our framework represent the dependent variables. the identification of these parameters results from the exploration of the main strategy elements and operational challenges. concerning the economic performances of fulfillment, we propose to assess different dimensions of the overall fulfillment efficiency, combining widely used indicators to describe logistics and fulfillment performances (e.g. in agatz et al, 2008): ‐ stock efficiency (indicating reliable sales forecasts and optimized product replenishment to reduce stock-risk, capability of monitoring stock levels across different stock locations and the capability of balancing stock between different locations) ‐ picking efficiency (indicating efficient organization of stock and picking zones for picking and order preparation) rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  15  ‐ delivery cost efficiency (indicating the total cost of delivery from the stock(s) to the customers\\' home or to the desired store for pick-up) ‐ channel organization efficiency (indicating the information exchange between sales channels and real time availability of data) ‐ fulfillment infrastructure costs (indicating the necessary investments, rents or outsourcing costs for the fulfillment infrastructure) ‐ return handling efficiency (indicating the speed and quality of the return handling process, from product reception to exchange or reimbursement for the client)  analysis in the first part of this paper suggests three parameters indicating the customer expectations: ‐ product availability (indicating the availability of the desired products) ‐ speed of delivery (indicating the time between the order placement and the reception of the products by the customers) ‐ ease of access and return of products (indicating the ease for a client either to get the products delivered/to pick them up or to return/exchange the products received) in order to assess more precisely how a fulfillment system corresponds to the customer expectations, we completed these parameters with parameters from the servqual framework, developed by parasuraman et al (1988) to measure service quality. nevertheless, this traditional service quality may not be applicable in an online environment (parasuraman et al, 2005). bressolles (2006) developed the netqual framework to specifically assess electronic service quality.  as multi-channel retailing provides both \\'traditional\\' and \\'online\\' service experiences, we have to combine these two approaches in order to identify all the relevant dimensions to customer expectations and retain only those which may be directly impacted by the fulfilment model.  therefore, we selected the following dimensions out of the servqual and netqual scales for our analysis: ‐ quality and quantity of information (netqual) (indicating the availability and correctness of the information provided in terms of product availability, stock level, delivery times etc. either on the website or in the stores)  rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  16  ‐ reliability and respect of commitments (servqual & netqual) (indicating the ability to deliver the products in terms of quantity, price, description and timing) ‐ offer (netqual) (indicating the lengths and the width of the product range available on the different channels) ‐ assurance (servqual) (indicating the competence and friendliness of the personnel usually in the store for buying, pick-up and exchange transactions of the client).  we did not retain those dimensions having only an indirect link with the fulfillment systems. these elements constitute the analysis framework we propose to analyze the overall performance of specific fulfillment systems. application of the analysis framework  we are now able to apply this proposed framework to the five identified fulfillment systems according to our objective to evaluate the fit between a multi-channel retailer\\'s business model and a specific fulfillment system. to be able to analyze each of the abovementioned fulfillment systems, we will explore the sensitivity of each of the parameters regarding the main characteristics of the different fulfillment systems.4 we apply numerical scores to each parameter, depending if the efficiency of this parameter is high (2), medium (1) or low (0). this qualitative evaluation, based on the discussion of the different elements of the retail mix and the operational challenges, aims to compare the relative efficiency of one parameter in different fulfillment systems. we do not intend to provide an absolute performance test. quality and quantity of information customers expect correct information, especially on pricing and delivery costs of the different channels, but as well on other parameters like product availability, speed of delivery and product characteristics. the retailer\\'s challenge is always to have the right information available on every channel.                                                  4 each of the above identified parameters expressing customer expectations and economic performance of a specific fulfillment system has multiple implications on other parameters. it is to retain that these parameters may be interdependent (e.g. the width of the product offer impacts the product availability, the picking efficiency and the fulfillment infrastructure costs).  rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  17  using a centralized stock provides the highest chance to have the right information available (score: 2), whereas an order preparation from stores induces the problem of obtaining the right information on the store stock level (score: 1). if the order preparation has to be completed on several stock locations (central warehouse and stores), it is very difficult to obtain correct information and the quality of information may be low (score: 0). reliability and respect of commitments customers expect retailers to keep their promises, especially in terms of delivery time and delivery service. central warehouse order preparation should facilitate this, as the quality of information is high and the fulfillment process can be optimized (score: 2). order preparation in the stores suffers from difficulties in keeping a real-time stock level of all the products. therefore, store preparation may guarantee only a medium level of reliability and respect of commitments (score: 1), whereas multi-stock order preparation may only provide a low level (score: 0).  offer customers expect to find the offer they expect on every channel, a large or narrow product range with the appropriate depth of assortment. the retailer has to make sure to be able to offer the products customers expect on every channel. order fulfillment at a central warehouse or from multiple stocks should be capable to provide the entire range of the products (both score: 2), order preparation at the store is limited to the only product assortment in stock at the store (score: 0). product availability the customer expects that the products he intends to buy are available in the channel he desires to use. a central warehouse order preparation may provide only a medium level of product availability (score: 1) compared to the other options, as the availability depends on the stock keeping and forecasting precision of this single warehouse. stores can only guarantee a low level of product availability because of the small number of stock for every referenced product and the continuous buying from customers in the store (score: 0).  multi-stock order preparation may use the stock of different entities (stores and central warehouse) and therefore guarantee a very high level of product availability (score: 2), especially in case of a high number of articles per customer order. rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  18  speed of delivery customers usually expect a rapid delivery of the products they bought and to be informed about the delivery timing. retailers therefore have to implement a fast and reliable delivery process, which may imply an external delivery service provider. a central warehouse usually needs to bridge the distance to the final customer, which may be long and therefore time-consuming. a medium level of speed of delivery may therefore be guaranteed (score: 1). as stores are closer to the final customer, the speed of delivery can be high when orders are prepared in the store (score: 2). orders prepared from multiple stock locations need a long time to be consolidated and can therefore only provide a low relative delivery speed (score: 0). ease of access and return of products customers expect easy access to the retailer to either pick up the products ordered or to return or exchange a product in case of dissatisfaction. home delivery from a central warehouse may make returns and exchange difficult for customers (score: 0), who have to use a postal service for returning the products (except in the case the retailer owns a quite dense network of stores and the store channel is fully integrated to handle returns and exchange from the online channel). order preparation in the store is usually done in the store closest to the customer. this store is therefore easy to access for the customer (score: 2). multi-stock preparation can only provide a medium level of ease of access and return (score: 1). although the customer can return a product to the closest store, exchange can be impossible if the products to be exchanged are only available at another stock location. assurance the customers expect competent and friendly personnel in the store for buying, picking up their orders, return or exchange. the same expectation may apply for the personnel on telephone customer hotlines or the delivery personnel. these functions being very often outsourced (especially the latter), retailers have to focus on their own sales personnel and make sure they provide the level of assurance the customer is expecting by providing the same information to all channels. the assurance of the personnel can only be provided in the case of order pick-up of the customer in the stores (score: 2; other option scores: 0). rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  19  stock efficiency for the retailer, the efficiency of stock management is crucial for numerous reasons. stock keeping and monitoring of stock levels, balancing between different stock locations and the forecasting of sales and product reorders influence the availability of the products and therefore the sales. efficient stock handling is as well an important cost element. central stock management can provide a high level of efficiency (score: 2), whereas a store can only provide a medium efficiency (score: 1) because of the low number of products per article and the continuous stock movement due to customers purchases out of the shelves. the handling of multiple stocks in the fulfillment process is the least efficient (score: 0). picking efficiency the picking of products out of stock to prepare the customer\\'s order is the key process of the overall fulfillment process, representing a very important part of the warehouse operating costs. this process is nevertheless transparent to the customer. a central warehouse can be organized in a way to optimize the picking process by planning and reducing the way picking operators have to go during the process (score: 2). depending on the volumes and the type of articles, it is possible to split the stock for whole cartons or open cartons picking or separate zones for stocking and picking. this optimization cannot be provided in a store or in multiple stock sites (scores: 0). stores\\' layouts and product locations are planned to make the customer spend the maximum time in the store and not to optimize the picking (de koster, 2002). delivery cost efficiency customers expect to pay the lowest extra cost possible for the delivery of their online orders and the retailer has to reduce the overall cost of the delivery. delivery of orders prepared in a central warehouse has always to include the transport to the customer\\'s home and therefore only achieve a medium efficiency (score: 1) compared to the delivery from a store (score: 2), where the distance to the final customer is short. pick-up by the customer from the store where the order was prepared is the less costly way of delivery for the retailer. any delivery from an order prepared in multiple stock locations (for home delivery or to a store for pick-up) is least efficient (score: 0), as the consolidation process of the order implies multiple costs of handling and transportation. rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  20  channel organization efficiency as stated above, customers want to be able to use different channels simultaneously. a retailer has therefore to manage all the channels in an integrated manner.  preparing orders for home delivery from a central warehouse is the simplest and most efficient organization (score: 2). order preparation in the store involves the online and the store channel in the fulfillment process, therefore adding a level of complexity (score: 1). multi-stock preparation adds further complexity, being therefore the most difficult solution to achieve an efficient channel organization (score: 0). fulfillment infrastructure costs the fulfillment process may generate important investment costs, when a specific site is built as the stock and the distribution center, or if the design and the organization of an existing facility have to be modified. renting or outsourcing this infrastructure generates additional costs as well. a central warehouse order preparation generates a high infrastructure cost (score: 0), whereas the store preparation generates the lowest additional infrastructure costs (score: 2). order preparation from multiple stocks may generate medium additional infrastructure costs (score: 1) to organize the consolidation of the orders. return handling efficiency customers expect their returns to be processed quickly, to receive an exchange product or to get reimbursed the purchasing price. the retailer must therefore provide a quick and efficient return handling process. a central warehouse enables creation of optimized return processing (score: 2) to check the returns, repack and restock them and send the exchange items to the customers. multi-stock fulfillment can only provide a lower rate of return efficiency (score: 1), as the returned items arrive in different locations and the exchange items may only be available on different stock locations. for a store it is very difficult to offer an optimized return process (score: 0), especially when returned products are not part of the store\\'s product offer.  we can therefore summarize the impacts of the different fulfillment systems on the different parameters as follows (figure 3):  rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  21  figure 3: the analysis framework  home delivery customer store pick-up fulfillment system 1.1 1.2 1.3 2.1 2.2  prepared in central warehouse prepared in store prepared in multiple stocks prepared in store prepared in multiple stocks customer expectations      quality and quantity of information high (2) medium (1) low (0) medium (1) low (0) reliability and respect of commitments high (2) medium (1) low (0) medium (1) low (0) offer medium (1) low (0) high (2) low (0) high (2) product availability medium (1) low (0) high (2) low (0) high (2) speed of delivery medium (1) high (2) low (0) high (2) low (0) ease of access and return of products low (0) high (2) medium (1) high (2) medium (1) assurance low (0) low (0) low (0) high (2) high (2)       economic performance      stock efficiency high (2) medium (1) low (0) medium (1) low (0) picking efficiency  high (2) low (0) low (0) low (0) low (0) delivery cost efficiency medium (1) high (2) low (0) high (2) low (0) channel organization efficiency high (2) medium (1) low (0) medium (1) low (0) fulfillment infrastructure costs efficiency low (0) high (2) medium (1) high (2) medium (1) return handling efficiency high (2) low (0) medium (1) low (0) medium (1)       total score customer expectations 7 6 5 8 7 total score economic performance 9 6 2 6 2 total 16 12 7 14 9   this indicates several results: - home delivery from a central warehouse (system 1.1) is the fulfillment system best meeting the combination of the two dimensions customer expectations and economic performance, providing a total score of 16. this system provides the highest score in economic performance (9) and the second highest score in customer expectations (7). - customer pick-up after preparation in the store (system 2.1) provides the highest score in customer expectation (8) and a medium score in economic performance (6). the overall performance of this system is second best (total score of 14). - home delivery after store preparation (system 1.2) provides medium scores in customer expectations (6) and economic performance (6), ranking third best in the overall score (12).  - any fulfillment system implying the order preparation out of multiple stocks appears to be less efficient: if the order is picked up by the customer (system 2.2), the total score is 9, if the rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  22  order is delivered at home (system 1.3), the total score is only 7. in terms of economic performance, these two systems provide the lowest score (2). - economic performances of order preparation in the store or from multiple stocks are identical for both home delivery or in-store pick up by the customer. the difference in customer expectations (difference of 2) results from the possibility to have a personal contact with the customer, therefore responding to the customer expectation of \\'assurance\\', which can only be provided in a store. discussion, managerial implications and research avenues  the qualitative analysis of the different fulfillment systems and their impact on customer expectations and economic performance reveals that different fulfillment systems can provide high overall performance levels in terms of customer expectations and economic performance. the framework shows that orders for home delivery prepared in a central warehouse present only a slightly higher overall performance than an order prepared in a store for customer store-pick-up. a retailer has to assess the importance of each of the analyzed parameters for his specific retail mix and to optimize the trade-offs between channel fulfillment synergies and specific needs on different channels. depending on the product mix between food and non-food products, the width of product assortment and the characteristics of the existing store network, specific solutions may be more appropriate than others to fit with a specific business model. whereas proximity to customers is best achieved through a store network, stores add complexity on different levels in the fulfillment process which affect timing, costs and reliability. multi-stock consolidation seems to be always by far the less efficient model, regarding the customer expectations and the economic performance. this corresponds to the three initially mentioned multi-channel retailers: fnac abandoned the multi-stock preparation and completely integrated their fulfillment for the different channels, and neither tesco nor monoprix apply a multi-stock solution, whilst optimizing the in-store order preparation. rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  23  our proposed framework could prove useful for multi-channel retailers in various ways: it provides a tool to evaluate the chosen fulfillment system and therefore identifying improvement potentials on specific parameters. it could also provide helpful to measure customer satisfaction. moreover, it should clearly be useful in anticipating the needs for fulfillment systems when planning to implement a multi-channel strategy. the proposed qualitative framework should be further validated by conducting supplementary empirical analysis, although it may be difficult to compare economic performances and customer expectations of different fulfillment systems in a same company. another difficulty may be to isolate the impacts of the supply chain from other impacts (marketing, pricing, product policy etc.). a limitation of our framework is the fact that it does not assess the interdependencies between the different dependent parameters, but only focuses on one major impact at a time. a first step to further back this framework could be to conduct a dynamic analysis through a simulation, testing values for the different parameters of the analysis framework. research could aim to find evidence if there is an \\'optimum\\' fulfillment system for every multi-channel retailer. such an optimal model could be defined depending on different independent variables like product assortment, average number of items per shopping basket, value of products, product characteristics, degree of channel integration etc. this would also include an analysis of the trade-off between cost- and customer service level optimization. such a research could as well reveal that there is no optimum model, but just a set of independent and non stabilized models evolving quickly as the retailers\\' strategy mix evolves.   acknowledgement  the work on this paper was partially supported by the innovation and regulation chair of orange, ecole polytechnique, telecom paris. rirl 2010 -

solutionsaimed at supporting supply chain management by leveraging real-time availability ofsupply chain data, and algorithms capable to recognize, notify, and sometimes manageexceptions.event management software\\'s primary functions includeo measurement,o monitoring,o proactive notification,o decisions support ando control of supply chain by events.several hundred suppliers have already developed and launched in the marketsoftware applications that cover a number of supply chain activities. mrp, drp, andforecasting tools support supply chain and logistics planning activities, while erp,warehouse management, inventory track and trace systems support management of mostof the execution and operational activities. an entire software category, crm, handlesthe relationship with the customers in many of its aspects.ideally, event management software application should be able to link the entiresupply chain, monitoring the flow of goods and information, and alerting any time that apotentially disruptive event or chain of events arises.1.1 the evolution of supply chain event management applicationsfirst generation event management applicationsfirst-generation event management systems are based on inventory management andshipments track and trace capabilities. these systems are able to capture single events -events are typically defined as gaps between a set and a measured level in predefined67parameters, for example low safety stock, or late delivery. the criticality of the event isdirectly proportional to how wide the gap is (for example how depleted is the safetystock, or how many hours/days/weeks late is a shipment). usually the number ofparameters that can be measured and therefore used for management by event is limitedto a set decided by the user and set up by the software provider or system integrator.second generation event management applicationssecond-generation event management systems add to the first-generation capabilities:they not only generate alerts for events, but they also suggest a number of actions aimedat addressing the problem and preventing disruptions, the most advanced are also capableto prioritize this list of possible actions. for example, in the case of a late inboundshipment of raw material, the system is able to offer several options of actions, such asrequesting a shipment from a different supplier, or set up an expedite shipment.third generation event management applicationsthird-generation event management software goes one step forward and offersautomated functionalities as reaction to the event. for example, the system automaticallysends an inventory replenishment order whenever the inventory falls below a set level.additionally, the most sophisticated software solutions are able to link togetherdifferent software systems already in place in the supply chain, like inventory planning,shipment track and trace, and customer relationship management. in this case, if an eventalert regarding a late shipment is generated, the system may be able to cancel the lateorder, automatically switch to a new supplier, set up the shipment with a preferredcarrier, and alert key customers.1.2 future generations of event management applicationseven state-of-the-art event management software, however, typically has aconceptually limited and shortsighted definition of what an \"event\" is. such systems78tends to lack structure and a truly supply chain oriented framework for providing anadequate definition of what an event is and a meaningful way to measure its criticality.the purpose of this thesis project is to explore the feasibility of a next generation ofevent management software, base on a network analysis systems for inventory/orders,and encompassing the entire flow of inventory, information, and interactions betweenspartners and participants, throughout the entire supply chain.1.3 shortcomings of present event management applicationsin order for event management software to effectively support the supply chain, andbe able to manage by event in a meaningful manner, there are several key factors thatneed to be included in the formulation of the next generation of event managementapplications:1. simply integrating different enterprise software solutions within a single companyor division is often already an overwhelming task. however, building a systemthat can support the entire supply chain activities by event management requiresmuch more than that. in order to enable event management capabilitiesthroughout the entire supply chain, integration is required not only within the wallof the single corporation, but also in the \"gray\" areas between corporations, in theweakest links, which often are the source of the majority of problems. inter-company ties require visibility to expand to and light the entire supply chain.visibility alone, however, is by no means sufficient to manage a supply chain.visibility is just the first and basic instrument for extracting information from thesupply chain. the information, then, needs to be analyzed, put in perspective,referenced and compared and, finally, transformed into meaningful actions. thereis need for coordination and the ability to capture and eliminate repetitions,duplications, and inefficiencies. measured against a new paradigm, a \"disruptiveevent\" will no longer be a mere gap between set and measured levels for few89discrete parameters, but rather be a disruptive trend in inventory strategies, or apatterns of late deliveries with roots in the way the company negotiatestransportation with its preferred carriers. such a supply chain event managementsystem assumes that supply chain\\'s participants have the capability of capturingevents, and generating and transmitting data in real time, in and across the entiresupply chain. this in turn assumes the adoption of communication standardswithin the chain, such as xml (extensible markup language) and edi(electronic data interchange) while in the reality, many participants still rely ontelephone, fax, or word and excel documents exchanged by email.2. current solutions are aimed at addressing local problems, with a very low level ofsupply chain coordination. presently the main purpose of the software is to detect,and quickly address operational and day-to-day disruptions that may arise.current solutions miss a reference structure and cannot fully evaluate the impactthat the problem considered may have at a higher level in the supply chain. whilea delay in a single shipment is disruptive, a trend of repeated smaller delays maybe much more harmful for the supply chain, and impossible to detect with thepresent event management instruments. in the currently available software, thecriticality of an event occurring in specific segment of the supply chain is simplymeasured as a gap against set levels. for example, if safety stock falls below a setlevel, the supply chain event management system will trigger an alert, send it tothe process owner at the appropriate level, or even automatically react with anaction (such a replenishment order) to replenish safety stock. however, thesystem is not capable of measuring the event against a supply chain framework,and there is no instrument to evaluate the criticality of that event over the entiresupply chain flow. without a holistic view of a supply chain, and a backbonestructure that reflects this view, it becomes very difficult to meaningfully applyevent management. and it becomes even more difficult to put event managementinto context as a tool for improving inventory management in a broad sense,linked to product lifecycle management and, at a higher level, to the long-termstrategy of a company. current solutions are not equipped to detect and evaluate910how events propagate in the supply chain, and how they affect the long-termbehaviors and trends in the supply chain. in the absence of a reference system toput events into a wider sc perspective, a variation against a set level willautomatically trigger an alert, even if the event were considered non-critical whenmeasured against a comprehensive supply chain model. there is not yet a networkto measure events against; there is no sense of path. there is no differencebetween today\\'s crisis and long-term disruptions. in the absence of a referenceframe or any other input, all events are equal and live just \"today\". even in thestate of the art event management solutions, there is not yet the sense of time.thus, every event becomes critical and every event becomes a crisis, which needsto be addressed today, and which has high probability of not leaving a trace ofitself.3. supply chain event management software capabilities are confined within a singleparameter at the time (shipment delay, safety stock level, disruption/delay inproduction), while in reality, the supply chain acts as a living organism, wherepatterns and combinations of events, through coordination, ties, and correlation,cross the boundaries of different sectors and create results that may differ widelyfrom the sum of effects created by the single events. currently used alert systemsgenerate alerts when a single exception occurs. specifically, when a parameterexits an acceptability range set in accordance with the user company\\'s policies.however, what often constitutes a trigger for an alert is not a single event, butrather, the combination of a number of events. the presence of patterns of eventshappening in different segments of the supply chain, simultaneously or incascade, can lead to disruptions that cannot be prevented and avoided bymonitoring single exceptions. let\\'s consider the following examples:a) a slightly late delivery event bypasses a traditional event-management system.accords are taken at the phone between the company\\'s buyer and the supplier\\'ssale force. however, the parts to be delivered are needed for the production ofgoods for an important client whose demand has suddenly doubled. the result of1011this combination of events has a very high probability of generating a non-perfectorder, while none of the single events has.b) a delivery of raw materials is cancelled, and this event triggers a traditionalexception-alert notice, or, in more advanced systems, even an automaticreplenishment order. however, the materials were to be used for a client whosedemand dropped significantly. not only was the delivery cancellation not causingdisruption, but it was contributing to keeping the inventory level in the correctrange.these simple examples show just a few of the limitations of a traditionalexception-based alerting system. they are not flexible and \"smart\" enough tocapture possible disruptions/improvements to supply chain processes generated bycombinations of different exceptions. additionally, human intervention - such asdirect settling of a problematic event, on the phone between buyers and suppliers- often cancels any trace of the event itself. in the absence of records, it is almostimpossible to identify the causes of recurring problems and address themappropriately.1112chapter 2 literature reviewa future generation of event management systems for inventory management acrossthe entire supply chain, as the one suggested in chapter one, should be:o built on the firm\\'s industry-specific expertise and own practices\\' knowledge ofinventory management, and capable to monitor the key inventory metrics;o based on project management principles and on a pert-/cpm-like network forinventory, used as framework for putting events into a context which ismeaningful for supply chain dynamics;o capable of leveraging the technology already developed for event managementsolutions, and available in the software currently offered,2.1 inventory parametersin order to measure and quantify the entity of the events related to inventory,inventory parameters need to be set and included in the framework for an eventmanagement solution. such parameters may include forecast frequency and error (to beunderstood in their behavior over time), planning frequency, communication efficiencybetween different levels of the supply chain, and any other relevant parameters affectinginventory management. though most parameters are common to many productionenvironments, there is not a set recipe, since specific industries, business practices, andproduction processes may require or even dictate some of the parameters.in order to assess and correctly quantify the criticality of events, a number of factorsneed to be taken into consideration while setting the appropriate inventory parameters,such factors can grouped under different families as follows:product factors:including details and features of products, at the product-family or sku level, dependingon the nature of the event management solution; product\\'s life cycle; products\\' physicaldimensions, weight, and packaging requirements;1213cost factors:including factors related to products\\' cost, pricing, and profit margins. factors related tocost, price, cost of labor, and margin trends play an important role in monitoring a firm\\'salignment between competitive strategy and internal practices;production factors:including production volume, product mix, ramp up times, production time, cost, andflexibility in domains of both time and cost.it is important to notice that in the process of building a framework able to supportinventory management by exceptions, and when setting the inventory parameters, a firmshould have a clear definition of its processes and align them with the inventorymanagement strategy. additionally, inventory parameters, and the way these parametersare measured, reflect not only the nature of a firm\\'s business, products, and processes, butalso strategic choices, such as the way the firm wants to compete. low cost, speed-to-market, quality, and flexibility, are all different domains for competition, and each ofthem requires a special treatment of inventory, and a specific event managementframework that establish the most important metrics, and capture relevant events andexceptions.2.2 project management, cpm, and pert networks.project managementproject management is defined as the coordination of groups of activities wherein themanagers plan, organize, staff, direct, and control to achieve goals and objectives withconstraints on time, cost, and performance of the end product\\'. project managementinvolves coordination, and planning, as well as sequencing and scheduling of theactivities and processes that lead to the achievement of the desired goals.1 joseph j. moder, cecil r. phillips, edward w. davis, (1983), \"project management with cpm, pertand precedence diagramming\"1314project management applied to the flow of inventory within the supply chain impliesthe capability of understanding where the inventory comes from, what relationship a firmhas upstream in the supply chain with its suppliers of products, sub-assemblies, services,and outsourced manufacturing. it implies also that the firm is able to correctly define thesourcing, manufacturing, and inbound and outbound logistics processes as well as theorder fulfillment process downstream in the supply chain, by understanding customerrequirements, expected service level, by being able to prioritize accounts by strategicimportance and by knowing very well industry and competitive dynamics in its market.network models and critical patha network model constitutes the representation of a project as a sequence of activitieseach requiring a set time. in a network model2 (figure 1) all the activities preceding agiven activity must be completed before the given activity commences. each activitylinks an event to the following one, on a given path. in the sequence of activities, whilesome of them are exactly timed, others have a certain slack orfloat time, which meansthat they can be completed prior to the occurrence time of their succeeding activities.in a supply chain model, for example, it makes a significant difference if the sameevent occurs in a slack path (possibly no delay for the rest of the supply chain) or in anon-slack path (in which case all the activities after that will be impacted).a21 2a1 a3b1 b2 el e20 3 4 5 8cd1 d3d26 72 joseph j. moder, cecil r. phillips, edward w. davis, (1983), \"project management with cpm, pertand precedence diagramming\"1415figure

before theoccurrence time of the following ones (slack paths).in a network model, the critical path is defined as the longest path in the network.depending upon the segment of the network where they occur, events and disruptions inthe network can lead to different outcomes, from no consequences, to major delays andthe definition of a new critical path.3 joseph j. moder, cecil r. phillips, edward w. davis, (1983), \"project management with cpm, pertand precedence diagramming\"4 joseph j. moder, cecil r. phillips, edward w. davis, (1983), \"project management with cpm, pertand precedence diagramming\"1516in figure 2, the sequence b 1 -c-d3 represents the critical path for this network, in factnone of the activities on this path has float time.network-based project managementnetwork-based project management enable a systematic approach to projectmanagement and includes a clear sequences of actions aimed at creating a completeproject schedule that takes into account actions, processes, resources, and boundaryconditions. network-based project management methodology includes the followingsteps:1. project planning: defining the activities, and their technological dependence. in asupply chain event management system perspective, this translates into looking atthe entire supply chain, clearly defining the processes, and deciding whichparameters need to be measured.2. time and resource estimation: each activity needs to be based on availablemanpower and equipment. in an event management system context, this impliesassigning time estimates to each segment of the inventory path, from suppliers ortiers of suppliers, to end customer.3. basic scheduling: setting the earliest, latest allowable start and finish times foreach activity, and as a byproducts, they define the critical path within the network,and set the slack or float time associated with non-critical paths. the critical pathin the supply chain is now set, and with it the slack associated to selectedactivities. events are not all equally important. their criticality now is associatedto the activities they affect.4. time-cost trade-offs, evaluation of the resource constraints. in a supply chainenvironment, events are put into context; the choice of possible action involves1617trade offs that have deep roots in the strategy of the firm for inventory, pricingand competition.5. resource allocation: manpower and equipment constraints6. project control (time and cost): the schedule is used to measure the actual project.whenever major changes are required in the schedule, the network is revisedaccordingly and a new schedule is computed (see time control in chp 4, biblio 3).this will be a core part of future event management solutions.pertthe project evaluation and review technique (pert) statistical approach tonetwork modeling introduces probability theory in the management decision-makingprocess. pert and critical path method (cpm) are based on the same network setup, thepert system, however, uses a probabilistic approach to the time estimate for theactivities.given the mean as measure of central tendency of n measurements of the timeduration of an activity:(2.1) - = (t + 2 +.nand the standard deviation as measure of variability:(2.2) s = -(tf ) 2 +( 2 - f)2 +.+ (t _- )2nt approaches te , the expected time of completion of a given activity, for a sample ofmeasures that approaches infinity, and similarly, st approaches the square root of thevariance vt1 12the pert methodology then leverages the central limit theorem:given m independent tasks to be performed in sequence; t,, the actual time required tocomplete each task; vt. the actual variance associated with each tm (vtr and tm areunknown until the ask is performed), and t defined as follows:1718(2.3) t =t+t 2 +...+tm(t is also a random variable), then for m large enough, the distribution of t isapproximately normal with mean e and variance vt given by:(2.4) e =te +te2 +.+.tem(2.5) vt =vtl+vt2 +.+vtmthe mean of the sums is the sum of the means, the variance of the sum is the sum of thevariances, and the distribution of the sum of activity times will be normal regardless ofthe shape of the distribution of actual activity performance times.pert uses three time estimates for each activity, an optimistic, a likely and apessimistic estimate. this range of estimates provides a measure of the uncertaintyassociated with the actual time required to perform the given activity. the estimated timefor a given activity, in pert is counted as a weighted average of the quantities:to= the most optimistic estimate (5% percentile)tm= the most likely estimate (modal estimate)tp= the most pessimistic estimate (95% percentile)as follows:te = estimated time for the activity(t0 +4tm,tp)(2.6) te 66(2.7) vt = 3 2the variance vt is computed with the following rules:o vt for the initial event is set to 0o vt for a generic, non-merge event in the network is calculated as the sum of theactivity variance vt and the precedent event variance.o vt for a merge event is calculated as the sum of the activity variance vt on thelongest path, in the case of ties, we use the path with the larger variance.1819the central limit theorem allows the assumption that the shape of the distribution of tis approximately normal, therefore probabilities can attached to each possible outcomesfor the project completion.2.3 existing event management softwareseveral firms have addressed the need for event management software. the followinglist includes some well-known names in the enterprise software industry:categoric softwarethe company\\'s product, xalerts, enable monitoring, notification, detection, andresponse to business critical events in real time. criticality, however, seems to bemeasured again against fixed levels rather than put into a holistic supply chain context.eventraeventra software\\'s event management strength lies in supply chain visibility and

complex supply chain model.2021vizional (saltare)vizional\\'s software focuses on execution, track and trace capabilities, inventoryvisibility, and traditional event management functionality.2122chapter 3 development of the conceptin order to understand how to implement project management and pert techniquesin a supply chain event management context, we have approached the problem from twodifferent point of view:o analysis of a single order fulfillment process: the order comes into the firm andtriggers a sequence of inter-related activities that ends with the customer receivinga shipment. this approach explores some of the supply chain dynamics throughthe lens of the single order, which replicates, in miniature, how the inventorymoves in the out-bound chain. we have labeled it \"micro-dynamic\" approach.o a second approach, labeled as \"macro-dynamic\" approach, includes a pertmodel of the inventory itself, modeling the flow of goods and information in thesupply chain.it\\'s important to notice that the purpose of these two approaches is not to providedetailed pert networks of the order fulfillment process and supply chain inventorymanagement, but rather to show the potential advantages of a supply chain eventmanagement framework that exploits the strength of such project management tools.an additional section is dedicated to how it is possible to leverage data collectedthrough event management activities to support and improve the pert network itself -by gathering reliable inputs for the time estimates - and provide a solid repository forbuilding a firm\\'s in-depth knowledge of supply chain trends and dynamics, through theanalysis of meaningful data.3.1 micro-dynamics approach: a network path for the order fulfillment processthe order fulfillment process has been selected for a first approach to the use of apert methodology in an event management context. the idea is to build a network thatidentifies a critical path and see how to measure events against the network scheme.2223figure 3 shows a simplified project network model of a single order fulfillment. ninemain nodes have been specified, numbered from zero to eight,

the longest path in the system: the path is given bythe sequence of nodes: 0-1-3-6-7-8 (table 2).by applying a \"micro-dynamics\" pert technique we can associate to every order itsown specific network path, were the determination of the duration times to, tm, and tpdepends on values known from past orders, as well as on the nature of the specific order,2425importance of the account, and present business conditions. a problem is critical if itimplies a delay for the customer. for one order the documentation can be on the criticalpath, while for another it can be transportation, or warehouse constraints, or outsourcedproduction. an event is not critical if there is slack that allows for delays in the processwith no delay for the final customer. events can be then sorted based on the path werethey occur, that path\\'s criticality, and the consequences that events bring to the overallsystem critical path.given the normal distribution of the project completion time, under the pertassumptions, it is also possible to calculate the probability to complete the project -fulfillment process in the case of the example - on time, or on a given day before orafter the expected completion time, assuming that there are no changes in the criticalpath. for the fulfillment process example, the expected completion time is 19 days, andfigure 6 shows the probability of completing the process in different completion times,from 15 to 25 days.figure 7. probability associated with the completion time estimate25cumulative probability of completion ofthe project1.0-... 0.8 -0 r->%

expected completiontime is 23 days, and figure 6 shows the probability of completing the process in differentcompletion times, from 17 to 33 days.figure 12. probability associated with the completion time estimatethe determination of he critical path allows us to divide supply chain events (both inthe micro- and macro-system examples) in three main categories:1. events that do not introduce delays in the overall project. such events will occurin paths with slack, and the delay that they bring is smaller than the slack time,therefore these events neither delay the overall process, nor define a new criticalpath;2. events that fall on the critical paths, and therefore introduce delays in the overallproject, but without changing the critical path. the delays introduced from suchevents will always propagate in the supply chain and lead to an overall process28cumulative probability of completionof the project1.0-0..80.0.17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 3329delay, but the sequence of activities that determines the critical path does notchange; and3. events that fall into slack paths and introduce delays larger than the allowed slack,therefore generating new critical paths. such events change the sequence ofactivities that lie on the critical path and design a new critical path.3.3 memory of past events: turning event management into a tool for monitoringmid-and long-time strategic goals.a very important part of a pert framework in a supply chain event managementcontext is a repository storing information about past events. such a resource, which hasthe function of \"memory\" for the event management system, will be used for assessingthe probability of delays based on past events. the information about past events,generated by the system, and stored in the repository, can provide data for setting theparameters to, tm, and tp for each path in the network.additionally, the information, and the behavior of the changes of critical paths can beused to categorize and understand mid- and long-term patterns and trends, versus short-term fixes, and understand the roots of the problems.for example, from a high frequency of events in an inbound transportation path,rather than simply extracting the frequency of late shipments, which does not necessarilyhave an operational relevance, we can extract the following information:o what percentage of late shipments is disruptive, and generates an overall delay tothe supply chain (because they either fall on a critical path, or on a path with slackand the delay exceeds the slack);o what percentage of these disruptive delays can be associated with specific causes,such as the choice of carrier, or supplier;2930o how the expected time of completion in a path evolves in time, and howperformance of suppliers of parts and services can affect the probability ofperformance in specific paths, especially in critical ones.3031chapter 4 conclusions and findings4.1 key findingsthese are some of the key findings that emerge from the analysis of the adoption of apert-based network for inventory to be used in supply chain event management:1. a definition of \"criticality\" is key to have effective supply chain management byevents. project-management based frameworks, like the one developed in thisproject thesis, should be used as a base for building an event management systemwith a clear and well-defined concept of criticality embedded in it;2. not all events are equal. there are multiple dimensions to define the relevanceand criticality of an event. presently available solutions are able to exploit onesingle dimension: the gap between a planned level and an actual one. however, auseful and operationally sound definition of criticality should also include theeffects and repercussions of that delay into the supply chain, and link the event tothe changes that may be created in the critical path;3. such networks do not simply compare set levels of certain parameters, but rather\"learn\" from the past. past events contribute to the computation of pathcompletion estimates and associated probability, thus they are instrumental indefining the probability of future events and determining the critical path (whichdepends on longest paths in first place and on largest variances as second elementfor choices);4. when an event changes the critical path, by affecting an activity with slack timeand exceeding the available slack, then a new critical path will be determined inthe network. in this case, \"criticality\" can shift to new areas of the supply chain,with consequences that can be located very far from the path where the event3132happens. a project management definition of criticality and a holistic view of thesupply chain can help put events into a context and monitor the \"critical\" part andpaths in the supply chain.5. when the attention shifts from looking at gaps between expected and measuredparameters, to considering the consequences of an event throughout the entiresupply chain network, then event management becomes a way to gain insight intosupply chain dynamics and a tool to understand and strategically manage thesupply chain, rather than \"fix\" problems locally;all these elements lead to a division of events in four major families:o events that do not bear supply chain-wide consequences: these are eventsthat happen in activities with slack times, and introduce perturbation witha duration shorter than the available slack.o events that introduce time delays in the supply chain: these are events thatfalls on the critical path (which is the longest path in the network),therefore, whatever delay they introduce, will propagate throughout theentire network;o events that define new critical paths: these events not only introduce delayin the network, but also

differentmeaning for the overall supply-chain.o \"new\" events: the definition of what a \"critical event\" is can be expandedbeyond a single occurrence of a gap between a set and a measured level(in inventory, safety stock, transit time). the new definition includespatterns in demand and supply, changes in probabilities, opportunities ofbundling, and a number of other elements that can influence a pathcriticality32334.2 what is needed to get thereis it possible to implement such a system? in most cases the answer is: not yet. or atleast, not at a supply-chain wide level. yet, even partial implementations of systemsdriven by such project-management network models represent a significant improvementover presently available supply chain management systems. what then is needed and maynot yet be there?1. a central repository for supply chain information. as said, not all events are equaland they can impact the supply chain in very different way, especially patternedand repeated events. dramatic changes in critical path can suggest the need forchanges in a firm\\'s strategic approach to certain areas of the supply chain.analysis and understanding of such changes can guide high-level decisions, suchas outsource vs. manufacture, internal fleet vs. external carrier among others. thefirst step, however, is to be able to capture such event-related information andtrends, in a central repository that can function as a \"memory\" for the entiresystem.2. more informatization in the supply chain. if activities included in the critical pathinvolve parties (such as suppliers, transportation provider, contract manufacturers,customers, among others) that are not able to link their it system to the eventmanagement system, there may be severe limitation to the purpose and scope ofan event management system.3. access to past event-related information. the central repository has the multiplefunctions of central unit for the coordination of supply chain event managementtrigger system, of source for the pert network path completion time estimates,and of storage point for event logs, which can then be retrieved and used foranalytics and data mining activity.33344. internal company barriers can put limitations to what can be done with an eventmanagement system. the layout of a frame system for supply chain eventmanagement requires coordination and inclusion of strategic, tactical, and day-to-day activities, keeping into account the entire supply chain and the firm\\'s overallstrategy. it is important that all the parties involved make their contribution,because that will determine the definition of critical paths.3435bibliography1) david i. cleland, william r. king, (1968), \"system analysis and projectmanagement\", mcgraw-hill series in

(1995), inventory is maintained to cater for customers\\' orders and competition and also to mitigate the effect of production and delivery lead-time. this leads to the concept of \\'make to stock\\' instead of \\'make to order\\' in anticipation of orders. the concept \\'make to stock\\' requires an effective forecasting process, particularly the accuracy between the forecast and actual orders. moreover, the consumers\\' knowledge and choices have changed over the years and the current emphasis is more than \\'fulfilling the needs\\' but rather \\'satisfying their needs\\'. thus, for many manufacturers, having the product range with high consumer demand are preferable with a wider range of options. they become more competitive, particularly for technology related products.     inventory is part of the assets of an organization and therefore, it is part of working capital. for some industries, for example, the high technology industry, the working capital required to finance operations is high. mistakes have serious consequences. many have difficulties coping with the continuous investment required to stay in business. in the aerospace industry, delays from the suppliers can result in the companies compensating customers for late delivery of the airplane. the amount involved in paying the penalty due to late delivery can easily wipe out profit for the year and will definitely affect the company working capital in the near future. thus, it is not surprising that most large organizations recognize the importance of supply chain management and include it as a key activity to improve the organization performance. traditionally, organizational performance is linked to profitability. this can be achieved through order fulfillment. such measurement is still very much valid, for instance, the return to shareholder fund is an important measurement to convince the shareholder for future re-investment, for additional capacity or new equipment or technologies as the industry dictate from time to time. apart from profitability, another important measurement is the volume of sales either by pieces sold or the amount invoiced. purchases in bulk or higher quantity reduces the fixed cost and to some degree, it is able to share out the variable cost. the greater the volume of purchases, the more likelihood that per item price will be reduced, either through effective negotiation or bulk purchase discount offered by the suppliers. moreover, with the intense global competition, many companies have started working closely with their suppliers to improve their product quality, and at the same time, reduce the cost of the products. this can be observed in the electronics sector where the big players are pushing the inventory management responsibility to their suppliers via a program known as vendor managed inventory. in such initiative, the suppliers manage the total inventory requirements and they are taking risks in the process of managing order fulfillment in supply chain management: does the dimension of inventory management matter in the aerospace                  45industry in malaysia: 43-52                                                                                                                                                      the inventory level and replenish when necessary. within the context of information technology, this is where information sharing is viewed as very important and crucial. the suppliers are made aware of any stock movements. the information is in real time thus ensuring accuracy in decision making.  it is often argued that organizations with weak inventory management are not competitive and may fail to survive. according to lewis (2003), continuous down time in the manufacturing can lead to higher cost of operation. in the absence of inventory management, order fulfillment is affected. thus, the success or failure of the business totally depends on the inventory management as high order fulfillment generates better customer service level and higher profitability. moreover, many items today have a shelf life and strict requirements to ensure the product functions optimally during usage and throughout the total product life cycle. in the aerospace industry, the firms impose shelf life for most of the items used, especially for items termed \\'flyaway\\' products, where records must show that these items are still valid and as described in the requirements. apart from the shelf life, keeping the items in the recommended storage condition is equally important where the composite materials are required to be stored for instance,in an environment below 20oc. otherwise their properties need to be retested before further product applications. this reveals the importance of inventory management in the airline industry.inventory and supply chain management in the aerospace industry 2.0 this paper examines the relationship between inventory management and order fulfillment performance. it reviews the literature examining the supply chain management and its effect on company profitability in the aerospace (high technology) industry. with the rapid rate of globalization and intense competition in the business arena, major changes are expected in inventory management and the entire supply chain management dealing with the planning and control of total material flow from end to end, that is from suppliers to end users. one of the very important parts of the supply chain is to determine the location of inventory and at what level to efficiently provide efficient service to customers at the most competitive cost. effective inventory management will result in the right level of customer service. the right service level ensures that customers are satisfied and having the right policies in the inventory management is part of the total supply chain management concept. inventory optimization can reduce the working capital or capital outlay, but the level required to balance with the level of customer service required is of utmost concern as many suggest that this could be different between firms in different industries the necessary inventory level to be maintained to ensure that manufacturing processes are not affected is the primary goal for most manufacturers and the losses incurred for down time are always too expensive. moreover, there is possibility that the manufacturer\\'s capacity loss due to delays cannot be recovered. this damages the  firm\\'s reputation and 46                                                                                               journal of business management and accounting, vol. 6(2) 2016: 43-52customer\\'s expectation. in such occurrences, there is a likelihood of losing customers. for the aerospace industry, any delays including non-performance in delivery result in heavy penalty imposed by the industry players.  therefore the relationship between inventory and order fulfillment in the context of supply chain management is important and expected to apply more stringently in the aerospace industry. inventory management does not receive much attention from the top and senior management unless there are issues of production stoppage or customer\\'s claim due to delivery delays. in most cases, top management only gets involved when the situation is really bad and some use the fire-fighting strategy to combat the problems. during such correction time, apportioning blame and finger pointing is usual in organizations. however, the root cause of the problem is never resolved, neither are plans made for improvements nor corrections carried out. based on findings from previous studies, the inventory management issue must be given serious attention by all, industry pratictioner and the academics. inventory management must be included in the core subject due to its importance in meeting the customer\\'s requirements and a primary factor in determining service level. the industry must have individuals who are well versed in inventory management in order to minimize the problems arising from the supply chain process and activities. figure 1 indicates the supply chain process in the aerospace industry and it can be observed that it is not much different from the supply chain process for most manufacturers as given by most textbooks. figure 1. the supply chain processin supply chain management, information sharing is an important element (paulraj, 2004; devaraj, krajewski & wei 2007). information on lead-time and quantity are important for the success of the supply chain management. according to zhang et al. (2002) and chopra (2001), it also ensures improvement in the supply chain cycle. lee !\"!!  order fulfillment in supply chain management: does the dimension of inventory management matter in the aerospace                  47industry in malaysia: 43-52                                                                                                                                                      et al. (1997) suggests that the supplier\\'s demand difference is drastically reduced due to the sharing of information among them. the fact that supplier management has become an important part of supply chain management is evident in our study. however, there are studies that stated otherwise. for example, the study by cachon and fisher (2000) found the insignificant benefits of information sharing. their finding is not unexpected, as the possible reasons could be the limited data size.    with regard to the number of sources in supplying products and materials to the manufacturers, the source of inventory from one source and two sources makes a substantial difference when there is an imbalance in demand and supply (tang, 2006). when there is an alternative, it means there is no restriction (gavirneni et al. 1999) and the information becomes valuable when it is flexible in responding to the system. in our study, the leading edge organizations are moving their quality focus from inspection to designing quality into products coupled with process control and process improvement efforts. they have appointed suppliers and the number is very small, only one or two suppliers for most materials. thus, the service level is expected to be efficient as it affects the success in managing the supply chain and the organization performance.due to the high carrying cost in the aerospace industry, the amount of inventory is kept at a minimum level most of the time. to minimize the inventory, the aerospace organizations work with the suppliers and the small number of suppliers allows for better relationship with them. in theory, assuming the volume remains constant, a decrease in supplier base means an increase in volume to the strategic suppliers and possible reduction in price due to increase in quantity. this is something that is disputable in our study. the research framework for our study is provided as in depicted in figure 2.figure 2. research

understanding of the type, collection and analysis of evidence within a well-defined theoretical framework, the research methodology section here covers the mentioned aspects.  the target population is the companies that have business deals with the two main aerospace companies in malaysia. a total of 20 companies were identified from the list provided by both boeing and airbus companies. for each company, 5 sets of questionnaires were distributed to the managers. in total, 85 sets of questionnaires were returned. the main reason the total population is low is that the aerospace industry is relatively new in malaysia. with the required technology and considerable huge investment, not many are able to become suppliers. the study thus becomes like a census. however, they were not compelled to respond to the questionnaire and only those who were willing to participate were counted as the sample. the data collection process was difficult as most of the respondents practice very strict rules on matters pertaining to sharing information with outsiders.  the dependent variables are on-time-delivery and inventory turns, which represent order fulfillment. the independent variables as provided in figure 2 are the (i) safety stock, (ii) storage practice, (iii) inventory risk and (iv) stock holding. each is examined separately, thus, eight hypotheses were tested. validity and reliability tests were performed prior to the regression analysis.  4.0 findingsthe data collected for this study was analyzed using the statistical package for social sciences (spss) software. missing data and outliers were removed during the analysis. reliability tests, using cronbach\\'s alpha, were performed on the measures of \"inventory management\" and \"order fulfillment\". for the measure of \"inventory management\" which has four dimensions: stock holding, inventory risk, safety stock, and storage practice, the reliability scores range from 0.610 (safety stock) to 0.859 (stock holding). the scores indicate that the measure of \"inventory management\" has acceptable reliability levels for its dimensions. reliability scores for the \"order fulfillment\", which has two dimensions: on-time delivery and inventory turns, are 0.763 and 0.765 respectively. the scores indicate that both dimensions of \"order fulfillment\" possess acceptable levels of reliability. the results of the reliability tests are shown in the following table, table 1.regression analyses were conducted to examine the effects of the inventory management dimensions on order fulfillment. the first analysis was to examine the effects of those dimensions on the first dimension of order fulfillment, i.e. on-time delivery. the second analysis was to examine the effects of the inventory management dimensions on the second dimension of order fulfillment, i.e. inventory turns. order fulfillment in supply chain management: does the dimension of inventory management matter in the

inventory management dimensions account for about 11.3% of the variance in on-time delivery (r2 = 0.113, f= 1.573, p < 0.167). only one out of four dimensions is significantly related with on-time delivery: safety stock (β = 0.276, p ≤ 0.05). for inventory turns, two of the inventory management dimensions are significantly related to it: safety stock (β = 0.209, p ≤ 0.10) and storage practices (β = 0.296, p ≤ 0.01). these two dimensions of inventory management account for about 29.6% of variance in inventory turns (r2 = 0.296, f= 5.176, p < 0.000).table 2 results of the regression

journal of business management and accounting, vol. 6(2) 2016: 43-525.0  conclusionsthe finding indicating the insignificant effect of stock holding on the supply chain management shows that it is not in line with previous studies such as sheffi (2002) and wanke (2011). this opposite finding could be explained by the fact that this study was conducted in a high technology industry where the cost of stock holding is very expensive. moreover, the items are specialized and relatively in fewer in number. its supply is regulated by the manufacturers of the raw material and it is more toward a \\'just-in-time\\' practices. similarly, the results for inventory risk also show different findings from the previous literature, for example by harland et al. (2003) and kleindorfer and saad (2005). similar arguments can be used to justify the insignificant effect of inventory risk on order fulfillment, further justification could be that the high technology players are cash rich which represents a relatively low percentage of the total working capital.results for the test on safety stock indicate a significant effect on both dimensions of order fulfillment. this is in line with many findings of previous studies such as (hult et al., 2004), wanke (2011) and sheffi and rice (2005). in the aerospace industry, the importance of safety stock can not be denied. if the components are not available just-in-time, ultimately the cost of processing will increase drastically due to the expensive nature of operations. the results of the tests on storage practices show a significant relationship only with inventory turn. this is explained by the fact that inventory turns influences the storage practices and policy (levy, 1997), thus having the right storage practices affects the inventory turns, as proven in the finding. moreover, the storage practices appear to be cost significant to both of the dimensions of order fulfillment. thus, it is suggested here that in the aerospace industry, due to the high value of components, more inventory turns are required. this requires better and appropriate storage practices and policies.the findings of this study are actually similar to various research findings such as levy (1997) and pujawan n (2008). this proves the importance of inventory management in order fulfillment for all industries inclusive of the high technology aerospace industry. although only two dimensions of inventory management: safety stock and storage practices, were found to be significant, it is justified by the nature and the environment of the industry. this paper provides a fresh perspective on inventory management affecting the order fulfillment. it shows that it is important to take the necessary steps to support the order fulfillment in a supply chain environment. within the context of high technology firms, particularly the aerospace industry, safety stock and storage practices are the two important factors in inventory management to improve order fulfillment. many organizations have been paying the penalty for non-conforming to delivery without realizing the importance of managing their supply chain management. it is suggested that future studies should look into different contexts such as in the solar industry, which also has a high carrying cost and high value of raw materials. it is order fulfillment in supply chain management: does the dimension of inventory management matter in the aerospace                  51industry in malaysia: 43-52                                                                                                                                                      hoped that this research can be of use to the industry in understanding the importance of inventory management in the supply chain perspective. referencescachon, g., & fisher, m.

fresh produceindustry since it can lead to higher inventory costs and lower service levels. if a supply chainhas multiple echelons, that further complicates the issue since companies have an added risk ofnot having the right amount of product at the right location at the right time. we conduct ourresearch on chiquita\\'s fresh express supply chain. we analyze the impact of perishability ontotal relevant costs. our research focuses on determining the optimal inventory policy for thesystem considering inventory holding costs, shrinkage costs, lost sales costs, forecast accuracyand service levels. we test the sensitivity of the system with respect to forecast errors and thetransportation lead time. we developed a discrete-event simulation model using arena softwareto conduct the research.our research demonstrates that by lowering the current target on-hand inventory levels at thedistribution center and retail stores, inventory holding costs and shrinkage costs are reducedsignificantly. under the optimal inventory policy, the system can save 31% in costs, improve theitem fill rate at the distribution center, reduce the total shrinkage volume, and maintain highservice levels of more than 95% at the retail stores. our sensitivity analysis shows that thesystem is very sensitive to the forecast errors. additionally, we recommend keeping thetransportation lead time as low as possible to maximize the products\\' lifetime at the retail stores.reducing the forecast errors or the transportation lead time would reduce the total relevant costof the system while improving the item fill rates across the supply chain.thesis supervisor: dr. amanda schmitttitle: postdoctoral associate, center for transportation and logisticstable of contentslist of

freshfood products including bananas, various other fruits, and blends of packaged green salads. thecompany markets its products under the chiquita @ and fresh express @ brands and otherrelated trademarks. the perishable nature of chiquita\\'s products presents a challenge inmanaging the inventory as keeping track of the age of inventory is challenging. the multiplelayers of inventory locations throughout the supply chain further complicate the issue ofinventory management. additionally, the volatile demand of the fresh express line and theinexperienced produce buyers at the retail level make the issue even more challenging.developing better order and inventory policies requires an understanding of the impacts of theproduct\\'s limited lifetime, the interactions of multiple inventory locations, and the trade-offbetween the relevant costs and the customer service levels.the objective of our research is to quantify these impacts and trade-offs to helpchiquita\\'s management to develop a better inventory policy that minimizes the costs and at thesame time achieves the desired customer service levels. the management at chiquita isconsidering changing the existing inventory and order policies in order to minimize out-of-stockand spoilage for its fresh express line of packaged green salads. due to confidentialityconcerns, all the numbers used throughout the thesis are for illustrative purposes only and are notnecessarily indicative of actual performance at chiquita.1.1 problem descriptionwhile most inventory models assume that items can be stored indefinitely to meet futuredemand, in reality not all items have an infinite lifetime. perishable inventory is defined as itemsthat decay in storage; as time elapses, the items gradually become partially or entirely unsuitable10for consumption. typical examples of perishable inventories include fresh produce,photographic films, drugs, and blood. perishability is typically classified into two categories:fixed lifetime and random lifetime. a product with a fixed lifetime has a pre-determinedlifetime, meaning after a specific number of periods, the product becomes unusable and must bediscarded. in reality, many products have random lifetimes because the exact lifetime cannot bepre-determined. for example, a product with a random lifetime could decay exponentially,implying that a fraction of the inventory is lost each period. products could also have a randomlifetime, a variable with a specific probability distribution (nahmias, 82).perishability presents a challenging problem for inventory management. perishabilitycan lead to increases in four costs:\" inventory shrinkage costs: costs due to inventory that must be discarded because ofspoilagee shortage costs: lost sales costs due to inventory stock out caused by perishability\" ordering costs: higher ordering costs due to more frequent purchases to counter theperishable nature of the products\" inventory carrying costs: higher inventory holding costs due to the lack of understandingfor the proper inventory levelin order to effectively manage inventory costs, supply chain managers must keep track of eachage level of the inventories. however, keeping track of the age of each unit at each period maybe difficult and impractical for most companies due to extensive computations that are involved.given this complexity, optimizing the system is incredibly difficult.most supply chain networks have a series of inventory locations; rarely is there only oneinventory location that ships to the final destination. supply chain networks with multiple layersof inventory locations are referred to as multi-echelon supply chains. having inventory inmultiple layers may have benefits, such as shorter lead time for the final destinations, betterservice for the final destinations, and lower transportation cost through shipment consolidation.however, since available inventory is divided and stored at more than one location, a multi-echelon system may have a higher risk of not having the right amount of product at the rightlocation at the right time (taylor, 2004). in order to have an effective inventory policy, one mustdetermine the dependencies between echelons and the proper inventory level required at eachechelon.1.2 the case of chiquita\\'s fresh expresschiquita\\'s fresh express network represents a complex multi-echelon perishable supply chain.the raw materials of fresh express products are harvested from either california or arizona,depending on the season, and then shipped across the united states to chiquita\\'s plants to beprocessed and packaged. the cycle time for raw materials to be turned into packaged salads istypically two or three days. once the salads are packaged, they are usually shipped to chiquita\\'scustomers\\' distribution centers (dc) within two days. typically, the products stay in customers\\'dcs no longer than two days before they are shipped again to the retail locations. the total leadtime is merely four to six days for chiquita to harvest the vegetables from the field, ship thevegetables across the nation to be processed into packaged salads, ship the packaged salads tocustomers\\' distribution, and deliver them to the retail locations.additionally, the high demand volatility of packaged salads further complicates the issueof managing fresh express inventories. the sales volume of packaged salads is heavilyinfluenced by retail promotions; a high percentage of fresh express\\' volume is sold underpromotions. the retailers frequently lower the prices for two purposes: to increase sales volumeand store traffic as a part of the marketing efforts, and to clear out aging inventory to minimizethe risk of potential loss of unusable inventories.these three issues (perishability, the multi-echelon system, and the high demandvolatility) combine together make inventory management for fresh express extremely difficult.inventory is often managed based on buyers\\' experience and intuition, which is by nature subjectto human error. as a result, chiquita and the retailers often carry excessive inventories to try toachieve a high service level. a large percentage of the inventory at the retailers\\' warehouses andthe retail stores is considered no longer fresh for consumers to purchase and needs to bediscarded. hence, chiquita would like to know whether or not a better multi-echelon inventorymanagement system can be developed for its fresh express products. specifically, chiquita isinterested in answering the following questions:1) what are the parameters for optimal inventory management depending upon forecastaccuracy, inventory carrying cost, product perishability, lost sales and inventory shrinkagecosts?2) what is the trade-off between service level and inventory costs?3) what is the impact of increased forecast accuracy on inventory-related costs?1.3 research motivationthe analysis of multi-echelon perishable systems is not as well developed as that of single-echelon perishable systems. most research for multi-echelon perishable systems has assumedthat the product has a fixed lifetime at each echelon, the system uses a continuous reviewinventory policy (inventory is reviewed continuously, and an order is placed whenever theinventory reaches below a particular level), and the system allows backorders (unfilled orderscan be fulfilled in the future). however, chiquita\\'s fresh express supply chain is a multi-echelon system with products that have random lifetimes. also, the system uses a periodicreview inventory policy (inventory is reviewed periodically, and an order may be placed basedon the inventory level after each review) and unfilled orders are considered lost sales. therefore,the assumptions used in most research are not applicable to chiquita\\'s fresh express supplychain.in this thesis we develop an inventory management system that simulates chiquita\\'s freshexpress supply chain. our research focuses on identifying ways to minimize out-of-stock andinventory shrinkage while maintaining high service levels, which are common goals that mostcompanies share. the objective of this research is to address the three key questions posed in theprevious section by chiquita and provide recommendation on multi-echelon inventory systemsfor fresh produce supply chains.1.4 research scopethis research uses chiquita\\'s fresh express supply chain as a case to develop a betterunderstanding of the challenges that fresh produce companies may face in managing theirinventories. in order to simulate chiquita\\'s supply chain, the research assumes that all productshave random lifetimes that decay according to a shrinkage probability and have maximumlifetimes of 14 periods (days). the system uses a periodic review and all backorders in thesystem are considered lost sales. these assumptions are based on system descriptions providedby chiquita personnel.our analysis focuses on one supply chain of chiquita\\'s fresh express line, which starts atchiquita\\'s plant in georgia. this plant is located across the nation from the sources of rawmaterials. we chose this location because it serves one of chiquita\\'s biggest customers, whichwe refer to as abc, inc. (abc). for the next echelon, we chose abc\\'s dc located in florida,.~ .\\' . ... . .......because this dc is served by chiquita\\'s georgia plant and has one of the highest sales volumes.figure 1.1 illustrates the physical locations of the sources of raw materials, chiquita\\'s plant ingeorgia, and the customer\\'s dc in florida.legendplant, galeizendraw product transport during summer customer

chainadditionally, we chose two retail stores that have typical characteristics shared by mostretail locations served by the customer\\'s dc. we chose this supply chain because it represents alarge portion of fresh express\\' volume and possesses common characteristics shared by freshexpress\\' other supply chains with other customers. the physical structure of this supply chain(one plant, followed by one dc, followed by multiple retailers) is common for chiquita.therefore we expect the results of our research to be applicable to fresh express\\' other supplychains and to provide insights to other companies that have similar supply chain structures.1.5 thesis structurethe thesis continues as follows. in chapter 2, we provide a review of the relevantliterature and methodology used in other research. in chapter 3, we provide the methodology,various assumptions and the conceptual flow of our research and model. in chapter 4, wedocument the model, the results of each simulation run, and a detailed analysis for each scenarioin the testing plan. finally in chapter 5, we conclude by providing overall observations andimplications of our research, key insights, and recommendations for future research.2 literature reviewin order to determine the best approach for modeling chiquita\\'s supply chain, we surveyed theacademic literature to understand analytical approaches on how to develop an inventory policyfor perishable products in multi-echelon systems. the literature available on inventory systemsfor perishable items varies by a combination of four assumptions or considerations: deterministicor stochastic demand, fixed or random lifetime, single period or multiple period of productlifetime, and single or multiple echelons. in section 2.1, we review the analytical approaches forsingle echelon inventory management, and in section 2.2, we review the analytical approachesfor multi-echelon inventory management systems. although the amount of literature onperishable inventory available is abundant, none of the models have assumptions that match wellwith the reality in chiquita\\'s business model.due to the complexity and limitations involved in implementing an analytical model forchiquita\\'s fresh express supply chain, we also surveyed literature on simulation methodologiesto better understand whether a simulation model would be suitable for the scope of our research.this survey confirmed that simulation is a practical approach to model a complex system, andwe present relevant literature on simulation methodology in section 2.3.2.1 perishable inventory management for single-echelon systemsthe origin of all perishable inventory system analysis can be traced back to the simple newsboymodel, in which the product lifetime is exactly one period and the order quantity decision isindependent in each period. both van zyl (1964) and nahmias and pierskalla (1973) derivedoptimal policies for products with fixed lifetimes of two periods and stochastic demand. van zylderived dynamic programming functional equations that consider ordering costs and shortagecosts. nahmias and pierskalla approach the issue by considering the outdating and shortagescosts. fries (1975) and nahmias (1975) extended the literature to consider products withlifetime beyond two periods with stochastic demand.as nahmias (1982) explains, the main challenge in managing perishable inventory lies intracking inventories of different age-groups at each position in the supply chain. thus, when aproduct lifetime becomes greater than three periods, models become multi-dimensional andcomputationally extensive. because computation of optimal policies for such systems becomesimpractical for everyday business decisions, approximations are potentially good alternativechoices. cohen (1976) developed an optimal critical number policy by using the stationarydistribution of stock levels and then finding the critical number of periods\\' worth of demand toorder that minimizes the expected cost. however, when the product lifetime is greater than threeperiods, obtaining the stationary distribution of the starting stock becomes very challenging.nahmias (1976) eased the computation by developing a heuristic critical number approximationapproach for products with fixed lifetime and stochastic demand. this approximation model wasproven to result in costs that are generally less than one percent higher than the global optimalcost. nahmias (1977) and nahmias (1978) extended the approximation technique for productswith random lifetimes and for systems with a set-up cost.2.2 perishable inventory management for multi-echelon systemsclark and scarf (1960) were the first to model the optimal policy for a multi-period, multi-echelon inventory system subjected to stochastic demand. since then extensive research hasbeen done on multi-echelon inventory systems, yet research on multi-echelon inventory systemsfor perishable products is still limited due to its complexity. yen (1965) was the first to considera perishable inventory policy in a multi-echelon system using a stationary critical number orderpolicy. yen assumed that each regional location always receives the same proportional age ofinventory according to its order quantity. cohen, pierskalla and yen (1981) discussed periodicreview policies which focus on inventory allocation for a multi-echelon system that differentiatesproducts by age. their model did not remove the over-age stock from the inventory, but thepenalty cost associated with over-age stock was set sufficiently high to ensure small volumes ofover-age stock in the system. matta and sinha (1995) investigated the periodic review of a two-echelon system for non-perishable products. kanchanasuntorn and techanitisawad (2006)extended matta and sinha\\'s model to include perishable items with fixed lifetimes using anapproximate periodic review policy.there is limited research on multi-echelon inventory management systems for perishableproducts with a maximum fixed lifetime beyond three periods and a random lifetime with decayaccording to a probability distribution. to our knowledge, when the scope is further narroweddown to a multi-echelon system that uses periodic review and considers lost sales, shrinkage,stochastic demand, non-zero lead-times and forecast accuracy, no relevant models have beenpublished. because of this and the fact that analytical approaches are generally complex anddifficult to implement for day-to-day operations, we felt that simulation would be a betterapproach to capture chiquita\\'s supply chain. in section 2.3, we discuss the simulation modelingbriefly.2.3 simulationalthough an analytical approach is generally the preferred method in developing inventorypolicies, it becomes intractable when the states of the inventory are too complex to be expressedin equations. while analytical approaches may be impractical for a complex inventory system,computer simulation modeling can help to keep track of the states of the inventory and monitorthe interaction between the changes in each echelon of the supply chain.white and ingalls (2009) define a model as an entity that is used to represent some otherentity for some defined purpose. models are used when direct investigation of the actual systemis impractical or expensive. they describe simulation as an experimental approach to studyingmodels. a simulation modeler first creates a model that imitates the behaviors of the actualsystem, then experiments with the models with different inputs to observe the behavior, and atlast tries to understand, summarize, and generalize that behavior. because simulation modelinghelps researchers understand the behavior of complex models in a cost-effective way, simulationhas gained popularity and been widely used for academic research as well as for solving real-world problems. for example, snyder and shen (2006) used simulation models to gain insightson the differences between supply uncertainty and demand uncertainty in multi-echelon supplychains. schmitt and singh (2009) constructed a model that helps a large consumer productscompany to understand its vulnerability to disruption risk and the potential impact to customerservice.using a simulation model also helps to test the impact of increases in variability, widelyknown as the bullwhip effect phenomenon, on the forecast-driven multi-echelon system. simchi-levi (2000) defines the bullwhip effect as the increase in demand variability as the demandtravels up in a supply chain. the bullwhip effect is caused by multiple factors, including orderbatching and miscommunication of customers\\' true demand throughout the supply chain.law (2003) provided a concise yet comprehensive guide on conducting a successfulsimulation study. he discusses several key steps to developing a successful simulation study.these key steps are:1. formulate the problem. simulation modeling typically starts with formulating theproblem, defining the overall objective of the study and listing the specific questions thatthe study needs to address.2. construct a conceptual simulation model. once the objective is clearly defined, modelerscan begin constructing the conceptual model. modelers first need to collect informationto understand the system structure, and collect data to specify model parameters andprobability distributions. with a good understanding of the system structure and modelparameters, modelers can compile all the information to create a conceptual model.3. validate the conceptual model. once a conceptual model is built, all parties involvedshould validate the model by walking through the conceptual model to ensure it is anaccurate representation of the system.4. program the model. with the granted validity of the model, modelers can begin toprogram the conceptual model in programming language or in a commercial simulation-software product.5. validate the programmed model. while programming the model, modelers shouldvalidate the model with the existing system and perform sensitivity analyses to gaininsights on the model factors6. conduct and analyze simulation experiments. this step is to determine the details onhow to run the simulations, such as simulation run length, length of the warm-up period,and the number of independent runs. with all the steps completed, modelers can startconducting simulation runs and analyze the results of each run.7. document andpresent the simulation results. after an adequate number of simulationruns has been conducted, modelers should document the model and the simulation resultsin details and in a fashion that is easy to understand for the targeted audience.2.4 summarygiven the complex challenges that chiquita\\'s fresh express supply chain faces, we determinedthat a simulation approach is more suitable than an analytical approach for the purpose of thisresearch. we used law\\'s approach as the reference guidelines for developing our simulationmodel and describe that process in chapter 3, and we document and present the simulationresults in chapter 4. the details of the conceptual flow and user manual can be found inappendix a and b respectively.3 methodologyin this chapter, we outline how we developed a simulation model using arena simulationsoftware developed by rockwell automation to capture chiquita\\'s fresh express multi-echelonsupply chain. we explain how we used the simulation model to better understand the impact ofperishability on costs and service levels. we include additional details on the conceptual flow ofsimulation model in appendix a and the user guide in appendix b.in order to develop a simulation model that replicates the fresh express supply chain, wefirst investigated the standard practices, performance metrics, and challenges that exist in thesupply chain. we determined the assumptions that we must make in order to develop the modeland the data that we would use to run the simulation. after we gained a good understanding ofthe key elements and data available in the fresh express supply chain, we began to build aconceptual model to capture all the processes involved in this multi-echelon supply chain. oncethe conceptual model was built and validated, we transformed the conceptual model into asimulation model in arena. after we programmed the simulation model in arena and created atesting plan, we were ready to conduct simulation runs to investigate the optimal inventorypolicy and the sensitivity of the costs.we use several abbreviations throughout this chapter and subsequent chapters. thecomplete list of abbreviations and their definitions can be found in table c. 1 of appendix c.recall that due to confidentiality concerns, all the numbers used throughout the thesis are forillustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of actual performance at chiquita.3.1 problem formulationusing law\\'s approach as our reference guideline (law, 2003), discussed in section 2.3, westarted our research by interviewing the supply chain managers at chiquita to understand thebusiness processes, the material and information flows, and the challenges facing the freshexpress product line. as mentioned in the introduction, we focused our analysis on chiquita\\'splant in georgia, abc\\'s dc in florida, and abc\\'s retail stores served by the florida dc. wegathered information on the existing inventory replenishment process and the performancemetrics, namely the inventory shrinkage and the service levels, to understand the standardpractices of this supply chain. we then determined the necessary assumptions that we needed tomake to build our simulation model. we also mapped out what data is available and how thedata should be used in the model. the details of these steps are discussed in the followingsections.3.1.1 inventory replenishmentat the end of each day, each retail store reviews its inventory position (ip) and places an order tomaintain an inventory level of two or three days of on-hand inventory. if inventory is available,the dc typically will fulfill each order within 24 hours. the replenishment of the dc\\'sinventory is managed directly by chiquita through abc\\'s vendor management inventory (vmi)system. supply chain managers at chiquita review the ip at abc\\'s dc five times a week andplace appropriate orders to chiquita\\'s plant. presently, chiquita reviews the dc\\'s ip every dayexcept on wednesdays and fridays. for the purpose of further discussions, we will refer theactivities that chiquita performs (as a part of vmi) on behalf of the dc as the dc\\'s activities.3.1.2 inventory shrinkageall the fresh express products carry a production date stamp. after 14 days from the productiondate, the product is considered no longer fresh for a consumer to purchase. at the end of eachday, each abc store removes and disposes any products produced 14 days ago from the shelf orthe inventory and considers the loss as inventory shrinkage costs.24additionally, each store also removes and disposes any products that age more quicklythan the expected 14-day of shelf life based on their appearance. the probability of a productneeding to be disposed prior to reaching the full 14 days increases as it ages. based on the inputsreceived from chiquita supply chain managers and the results from our initial simulation runs,we determined that an exponential growth probability best matches the shrinkage that chiquitaexperiences in reality. more information on this distribution is provided in section 4.1.the inventory shrinkage costs at the retail stores are absorbed by abc itself, but highinventory shrinkage costs could potentially damage the business relationship between abc andchiquita. currently, the total shrinkage at the retail stores is between 10 to 13% of the totalshipment volume from the dc to the retail stores, the goal is to reduce the shrinkage volume to8.5%.at the dc, abc has mandated an aging inventory shrinkage policy, in which abc doesnot ship any products that have less than six days of shelf life remaining from the dc to thestores. abc removes and discards any products produced eight days ago from inventory, and itcharges the loss back to chiquita. thus both abc and chiquita share a common interest incontrolling the inventory levels in a way that the potential inventory shrinkages are minimized atboth the retail stores and the dc.3.1.3 service levelsalthough both chiquita and abc would like to minimize inventory shrinkage, they also need tomaintain sufficient inventory levels as both of them strive for high customer service levels. thetarget average item fill rate (ifr) at the dc is 95%, which is calculated as the total demandfulfilled by the dc over the total quantity requested by each retail store on a daily basis. anyunfulfilled demand at the dc is recorded against chiquita\\'s performance, and any unfulfilleddemand at the retail store is considered lost sales.presently abc uses an \"in stock or out of stock\" binary metric to measure the servicelevels at the retail stores. abc considers an item at the store to be \"in stock\" when the store hasenough inventory to fulfill the daily average demand; otherwise, it is considered \"out of stock\".for example, if 85 stores out of 100 stores have enough inventory to cover their daily demand foran item, the service level for that item is 85%. however, for a store that does not have enoughinventory to cover its daily demand, the current \"in stock or out of stock\" binary metric doesnot capture the partial demand fulfillment by the store. after careful consideration and discussionwith chiquita supply chain managers, we believe that an ifr would be a more appropriate metricfor measuring true service levels at the retail stores. therefore we use an ifr metric in themodel and assume that chiquita would still require a 95% ifr at the retail level.given the high demand volatility for packaged salads, the current forecasts generated byeach store and the dc each have a mean absolute percentage error of 25%. as a result, the dcand the retail stores often have to carry excessive inventory in order to ensure a high customerservice level. the main challenge for the fresh express supply chain is how to balance thetradeoff between potential inventory shrinkage costs, potential lost sales costs, and inventoryholding costs. in order to minimize these costs, chiquita must understand how perishabilityimpacts the inventory levels and the dynamics between all the factors in the system.3.1.4 assumptionsin our model, we include two retail stores served by abc\\'s dc in florida. these two retailstores could represent actual stores, or they could represent two separate demand streamsaggregated from multiple stores. we assume that the chiquita plant does not have any rawmaterial shortage or capacity constraints at the plant; in other words, chiquita is always able toproduce and supply the quantity required by abc\\'s dc. hence, chiquita\\'s production plant isnot part of our research.our model replicates abc\\'s and chiquita\\'s standard ordering practices, in which the dcand the retail stores use a base-stock policy for replenishments. a base-stock policy implies aperiodic review policy, in which the dc and the retail stores each have an order-up-to-level(oul) for each product. the dc places orders five times a week and the retail stores placeorders every period, where a period is one day.our model assumes the product demand to be stochastic and normally distributed with aknown mean and variance. we feel justified this assumption because the normal distribution iscommonly used in many models in the literature. additionally, the demand used in the modelcan represent an aggregation of multiple individual products and/or stores, and the central limittheorem states that the mean sum of a large number of random variables will have a normaldistribution. additionally, we assume that the demand at each retail store is independent fromeach other.we assume that a first-in-first-out (fifo) policy is followed for the inventory at theretail stores and the dc. a fifo policy implies that older products are sold first to reducepossible shrinkage. although at the retail stores certain consumers may pick younger productsavailable from the back of the shelf over older products displayed in front, such consumerbehavior is difficult to predict and too complicated to incorporate in the scope of this thesis. wealso assume that the dc treats all the retail stores equally and does not prioritize a particularstore over another.the transportation lead time from the dc to the retail stores is assumed to be constant atone day (overnight), which means when the store places the order at the end of the day, if thestock is available, the order will arrive at the store the next morning, in time to be available forsale that day. the transportation lead time from the plant to the dc is assumed to bedeterministic and constant for each simulation. however, it is formulated as an input parameterso that the model can test the sensitivity of the transportation lead time from the plant to the dc.recall that the production lead time at the plant is 4 days.3.1.5 information flow and input calculationsfigure 3.1 below illustrates the information flow and the calculations conducted using the inputdata specified by the user. we explain the logic below.retail store 1 chiquita/dc retail store 2daily apply forecast apply foens appleo error (mape)ero(aeerrmp)rdfoecutri 3.1

daily demands for each retailstore using the mean and standard deviation obtained from the point-of-sale (pos) data. the28.... ....... ... ... ..........random daily demand is used as the actual daily demand realized at each store. we then applythe forecast error (mean absolute percentage error, mape) to this demand and errantly obtain thedaily demand forecast.we create the daily demand forecast using a uniformly-distributed random multiplier.we generate the multiplier using a minimum and maximum value range. since the forecasterrors can be either positive or negative, the maximum value is two times the given mape, andthe minimum value is negative two times the given mape. using excel, uniformly-distributedrandom numbers are generated between the minimum and maximum values. this means theaverage of the multiplier is equal to zero but the average of the absolute value of the multiplier isequal to the mape. this random number is multiplied by the daily demand, thus providing thedaily demand forecast. by measuring the forecast accuracy weighted across the total volume, weverify if the given forecast error was correctly translated. even though in our calculation we usethe daily demand to produce the demand forecast, this daily demand forecast is used in the modelas the forecasts generated by each store prior to the arrival of the actual daily demand.the oul for each retail store is determined by the target days of on-hand inventory. theuser inputs the target number of days of inventory, and then the actual daily oul is calculatedby adding the demand forecast for that number of days forward. for example, if the inventorypolicy at the retail store is 2.5 days of on-hand inventory, the oul would be the sum of thedemand forecast for the next 2.5 days. depending on the ip at the time of the review, each retailstore would place an individual order equal to the oul minus the ip, or equal to zero if thatsubtraction yields a negative value. the ip is the on-hand inventory level after satisfyingdemand minus the shrinkage. since the order placed at the end of the day would arrive the nextmorning, there is no shipment in transit needed to be included in calculating the ip for the retailstores.to calculate the daily demand forecast at the dc, we apply the forecast error to theaggregated daily demand from the retail stores. the actual daily demand realized at the dc isthe aggregated total of individual orders from each retail store.the oul for the dc is determined using the same technique used to calculate the oulfor the retail stores. the oul for the dc is determined by the target days on-hand inventory atthe dc and the total lead time from placing the order to chiquita\\'s plant to the delivery of theshipment. for example, if the target on-hand inventory at the dc is one day and the lead timefor chiquita to fulfill an order is five days, the oul at the dc would be the sum of the demandforecast for the next six days. depending on the ip, the dc would place an order equal to theoul minus the ip, or again equal to zero if that subtraction yields a negative value. the ip forthe dc is the on-hand inventory level after satisfying demand, minus the shrinkage, plus theshipments in transit to the dc.in figure 3.1, the numbers marked in red are input parameters that can be changed foreach simulation run. the input data is generated by a user in an excel file and the simulationmodel reads the data from this excel file. the use of excel file allows chiquita to use the modelto simulate other multi-echelon fresh express supply chains by simply changing the inputparameters there.3.2 conceptual modelthe information captured during the problem formulation step was critical for us to understandchiquita\\'s supply chain system and decide the appropriate parameters, performance metrics, andlevel of detail for the model. next we developed a generic conceptual model that details thelogic of the system and would be applicable to most other multi-echelon systems withinchiquita.3.2.1 model logic-flowwe compiled the information captured during the interviews with chiquita\\'s fresh expresssupply chain managers and divided the processes into eight steps. figure 3.2 provides asummary of the eight steps in the conceptual flow of our simulation model and we detail thelogic for each step below. we explain more details of each step in appendix a using additionalflow charts.step 1 step 2 step3 step4r - . -step5 step6 ste p 7 step8figure 3.2: overview of conceptual flowstep 1consumers purchase products at the retail stores on any given day, depleting the inventory usinga fifo product policy. at the end of each day, the retail stores remove the perished products... . ..........from their inventory. since backorders are not allowed in the system, any unfulfilled consumerdemand at the retail stores is considered lost sales.step 2the retail stores operate on a daily periodic-review policy with an oul. at the end of the day,each retail store checks its ip against the oul and, if necessary, places an order to the dc.step 3after aggregating the individual orders received from the two retail stores, the dc fulfills theorders using a fifo product policy for the inventory depletion on any given day. the orderfulfillment and inventory allocation for each retail store follows an order-splitting algorithm inorder to allocate material logically. the detail of this algorithm used in the model can be found insection a. 1 of appendix a.step 4the products shipped from the dc are received by the retail stores the morning after the order isplaced. since the maximum shelf life of a fresh express product is 14 days, in the simulationmodel we created 14 virtual bins at the retail stores. each bin contains fresh express productswith distinct age-groups. for example, bin 1 contains products that are one day old at the retailstore, bin 2 contains products that are two day old at the retail store, etc. using the differentinventory age bins, we ensure the accurate measure of shelf life, appropriate inventory transfers,and accurate calculation of shrinkage costs.the bin age at the retail store does not include the transportation lead times; in otherwords, the actual shelf life of the product is its bin age at the retail store plus the transportationlead time from the plant to the dc and from the dc to the retail store. for example, if the dchas products that are 10 days old and it ships these products to the retail stores, we add that stockto the appropriate bin 11 at the retail stores as the actual shelf life must consider the one daytransportation lead time from the dc to the retail store. this allows for flexibility of lead timeinput parameters; the model structure does not have to change in order to test different shipmentlead times to the dc.each bin at the retail stores is assigned a shrinkage probability according to the trueproduct age, so that every day a percentage of products in each bin may be discarded. thesediscarded products are unusable due to perishability.step 5the dc periodically reviews its ip and creates an order to chiquita\\'s plant if the ip at the dc isless than its oul, as mentioned in section 3.1.1.step 6the dc receives a shipment from the plant according to production and transportation leadtimes. for example, if the total production and transportation lead time is five days, the dc willreceive the shipment from the plant in the morning of the fifth day after the day when the orderwas placed. using the same approach described for the retail stores, we created 14 virtual bins atthe dc in the simulation model. the model conducts the inventory transfer in the same manneras was described for the retail stores in step 4.the model also provides flexibility for users to change the review schedule if needed. inother words, instead of reviewing the ip at the dc every day except wednesday and friday, theusers may change the model to review the ip based on a different review schedule.step 7at the end of each day, relevant costs and key performance indexes (kpis), as listed below, arecaptured and measured for each retail store and the dc. lost sales cost is not considered at thedc because abc operates its dc as a cost center, not a profit center. the dc charges a fee forproducts shipped to the retail stores, but the margin is only used to cover the warehousing andshipping expenses and not considered a sales profit. hence, any unfulfilled demand at the dc isnot charged a lost sales cost. however, as explained in section 3.1.3, the dc does require that itmaintains an average ifr of 95%.relevant costs:\" holding costs\" shrinkage costs* lost sales costskpis:\" item fill ratee shrinkage units* lost sales units* inventory positions* inventory levelsdifferent test scenarios are needed to compare these costs and kpis, and to evaluate thetrade-offs between them. the objective is to find the parameters that result in the lowest totalrelevant cost while satisfying the minimum ifr.step 8at the end of each day, any inventory left at the retail stores and the dc ages by one day. inother words, the product shelf life remaining is reduced by one day. in the model, we shuffleinventory bins or transfer the inventory to the next bin to ensure accurate measure of product ageand associated shrinkage costs. for example, at the end of the day, products that are 3 days oldwill now become 4 days old; products that are 4 days old will now become 5 days old, etc.products that are 14 days old will no longer be considered fresh for consumers to purchase andwill be discarded as shrinkage.additionally, as mentioned in section 3.1.2, some products may age more quickly thanthe expected 14-day of shelf life. thus a fraction of the products would be removed from theinventory according to the shrinkage profile.3.2.2 validationafter we mapped out the eight steps in the process, we presented the conceptual model tochiquita\\'s supply chain managers who validated that the model accurately represents the freshexpress supply chain. we also validated the model flow with supply chain and simulationexperts that include faculty and students at mit.3.3 model programmingwe programmed the conceptual model using arena, a discrete-event systems simulationsoftware. we choose arena because we have previous experience with the software andchiquita already has licenses to arena. in addition, arena integrates well with microsoft office;the users can have arena read and write from or to excel spreadsheets, making arena more user-friendly for day-to-day business operations.figure 3.3 below shows the screen shots of our simulation model programmed in arena.the top section of the figure highlighted in red represents the logic for the retail stores. themiddle portion of the figure represents the logic for the dc, the section of the figure highlightedin yellow represents the logic for the order creation process at the plant by the dc. finally, thebottom section of the figure represents the process in arena to read the input parameters fromand write the outputs into the excel file. please refer to appendix a for the more details ofsimulation model in arena.figure 3.3: arena model screen shot3.4 arena model verification and validationwe verified and validated the arena model to ensure that the model sufficiently matches realityand performs according to the intended design. we verified the model by monitoring whether. .... ...... ... ...........jiwj r1i j-j i-j 1--ithe model behaves as expected under different circumstances to ensure the conceptual model wascorrectly translated into the arena model. for example, we raised the inventory level at theretails stores and subsequently saw higher shrinkage volumes and holding costs at the retailstores.we validated the programmed model with supply chain managers from chiquita andsupply chain experts at the mit. the experts were convinced that our programmed modelsufficiently matches with the reality of chiquita\\'s fresh express supply chain system.additionally, we validated the model by comparing outputs from the simulation model withhistorical performance metrics provided by chiquita. we discuss the results in chapter 4.3.5 simulation testingfor our research, twenty independent simulation replications was deemed to be a sufficientnumber for producing results with tight enough 95% confidence intervals for performancemetrics. the duration of each simulation run was 365 days, or one year. the system producedstable results after the simulation ran for thirty days, thus we determined the warm-up period forour model should be thirty days. for more details on the simulation run parameters, please referto appendix b.we developed a testing plan containing different scenarios specifically to answer thethree key questions described in section 1.2. our testing plan focused on finding the optimalinventory policies for the retail stores and the dc. once we determined the inventory policiesthat resulted in the lowest total relevant costs while meeting the minimum ifr, we tested thesensitivity of the system to different percentage of forecasting errors and different transportationlead times from the plant to the dc.we used the aggregated demands from one of fresh express\\' main product families toconduct all our simulation runs based on a suggestion by chiquita\\'s supply chain managers. theresults generated from using this product family should provide a good overall representation ofthe whole fresh express product lines.4 resultsin this chapter we discuss the results of our simulation runs and the interpretation of theseresults. our objective was to find an optimal inventory policy that results in the lowest totalrelevant cost while satisfying the minimum ifr required at the retail stores and the dc. we alsotested the sensitivity of the system to better understand the potential impact of some of the inputparameters may have on the system under the optimal policy.in section 4.1 we describe the input parameters and the base scenario details. in section4.2 we discuss the simulation results under different inventory levels at the retail stores and at thedc and determine the optimal inventory solution. in section 4.3 we test the sensitivity of thesystem under the optimal policy to the forecast errors, and in section 4.4 we test the sensitivityof the system under the optimal policy to the transportation lead time from the plant to the dc.in appendix d, we present additional results of the sensitivity analysis such as cost break-downat each echelon.4.1 input parameters and base scenariotable 4.1 lists the retail stores\\' input parameters

values presently observed or used in chiquita\\'s fresh expresssupply chain. as explained in section 3.5, for our scenarios we use data from one of chiquita\\'smain product family, so the parameters are defined in table 4.2 in terms of that product family.we conducted the simulation using these actual values, however, in table 4.2, the pricing andcost information has been manipulated in the interest of confidentiality concerns. the existinginventory policy at the retail stores is to maintain 2.5 days of on-hand inventory. we choose onestore with high demand volume and another store with low demand volume to capture thedynamics of different types of demands in the multi-echelon system. retail store 1 represents............... : ...  .the store with the high demand volume and retail

fit byan exponential growth model. this means that even for products that are less than 14 days old,an exponentially increasing fraction of inventory is discarded at the end of each day due toperishability. the exponentially growing shrinkage probabilities were obtained using excelsolver to find the parameter that should result in 10-13% shrinkage, which is in the range of the................................... ::::..::::::::      .... ..... .. .  ..... shrinkage percentage experienced at the retail stores in reality. equation 4.1 presents the formulafor x, which is the shrinkage probability for a given age. the parameter a is determined in termsof k and the maximum value for t, the product shelf life, according to equation 4.3. thus excelsolver finds only one unknown parameter, k. in our case, the maximum product shelf life is 14days, resulting in 14 shrinkage probabilities.x = aekt or in x = kt + in a (equation 4.1)k -in (maximum shrinkage probability )-ln (minimum shrinkage probability ) (equation 4.2)maximum t-minimum t_ maximum shrinkage probability (equation 4.3)e^a(k * maximum t)wheret is the current age/time interval for the product (in our model, the minimum t =1 andmaximum t= 14)k is the growth constant determined according to equation 4.2a is determined according to equation 4.3 and is the initial value of xthe maximum shrinkage probability is 100%. seeking a 12% total shrinkage volume,using excel solver, we obtained k=0.2535 and a=0.0287, which produce the appropriateexponentially growing shrinkage probabilities from day 1 to day 14. additionally, abc\\'smandated inventory shrinkage policy at the retail stores is to discard 100% of any product thatare 14 days old regardless the appearance of the product. therefore, the value of parameter kobtained by excel solver is such that we have an exponentially growing shrinkage profile fromday 1 to day 14 and we have 100% fixed shrinkage probability at day 14. the actual shrinkageprobabilities obtained and used in the model are listed in table 4.2.we ran the simulation for the base scenario with these shrinkage probabilities andvalidated that these probabilities indeed produce aggregated total shrinkage volume at the retailstores within the valid range of 10% to 13%. table 4.3 below indicates the observed andvalidated shrinkage volume for each store and their

been manipulated in the interest of confidentiality concerns asin case of the retail stores. however, we conducted the simulation using actual numbers for basescenario. the existing inventory policy at the dc is to maintain 1 day of on-hand inventory.. ................................................................ ..however, since the lead time from when the order is placed to chiquita\\'s plant until the order isdelivered to the dc is five days, chiquita must maintain a total six day worth of inventory in thepipeline. the dc does not check the appearance of the products, thus the shrinkage probabilityat the dc does not follow the exponentially growing shrinkage probability. the mandatedinventory shrinkage policy at the dc is to discard 100% of any product that have less than

................................................4.2 optimal inventory levelswe first determined the reasonable ranges of inventory levels at the retail stores and the dcseparately. we then performed simulation tests by varying both target inventory levelssimultaneously to determine overall optimal multi-echelon inventory levels. an optimal solutionmeans the inventory levels resulted in the lowest total relevant costs for the system, which is thesum of the inventory holding costs, the lost sales costs, and the shrinkage costs, while satisfyingthe minimum ifr (95%) at the dc.4.2.1 inventory at the retail storeswe first ran the simulation with the base scenario inputs from tables 4.2 and 4.5, then we heldthe dc inventory level constant and changed the days of on-hand inventory levels at the retailstores to understand at which values the inventory policy would result in reasonable costs yetstill satisfy the minimum requirement of 95% ifr. we tested the target days on hand inventorylevels at the retail stores in the increments of /2 integer values between 2 to 5 days. we testedthe increments of % integer values because those are the smallest possible increments that abcoperates with, and we set the minimum at % of a day because the store would not acceptcomplete stock-outs and always need some inventory on hand to satisfy demand.table 4.6 presents the total relevant costs at different values of target days on-handinventory and figure 4.1 and 4.2 graphs the results. we can see that if we only consider theretail stores, 1.5 days of on-hand inventory results the lowest cost and still satisfies therequirement of 95% ifr.table 4.6: inventor targets at the retail storestarget onhand days at retal stom 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5dcifr 99.1 99.6 98.4 95.3 91.7 85.9 80.5

.. . ................................ ............... figure 4.1 shows the effect of target on-hand inventory level at the retail stores on theifr at each echelon. as the target on-hand inventory at the retail stores increases, the ifrs atthe retail stores increases and the ifr at the dc decreases. our analysis indicates that the ifr atthe dc decreases with increasing target on-hand inventory levels at the retail stores because thestores order farther into the future with less accuracy which means the dc\\'s ability to fill ordersaccurately is reduced. the shape of curve suggests that the ifrs at the retail stores remain above95% for target on-hand days that are greater than 1.5 when the base on-hand inventory target of 1day is used at the dc.considering figure 4.2, we observe a clearly convex curve with the optimal solutionachieved when the target on-hand inventory is equal to 1.5 days. for the target on-hand daysless than 1.5 days, the total relevant cost for the system is higher due to higher lost sales costs atthe retail stores and higher inventory holding costs at the dc. for the target on-hand daysgreater than 1.5, the total relevant cost for the system increases as a result of the increases of theinventory holding costs and the shrinkage costs.based on the costs and ifrs observed, we determined that the reasonable range for targeton-hand inventory at the retail stores is between 2 to 4.5 days. this is because for target on-hand days greater than 4.5, the ifrs at the retail store remain relatively constant but the totalrelevant cost for retail stores and the system increases.4.2.2 inventory at the dcusing the same approach described for the retails stores, we changed only the days of on-handinventory at the dc and held the retailer levels constant at their base value (2.5 days). we testedthe target inventory levels at the dc in the increments of 1/2 integer values between 0 to 5 days.table 4.7 presents the total relevant costs at different values

retail stores both increase as the target on-hand inventory atthe dc increases. the shape of curve suggests that the ifr at the dc remains above 95% fortargets of on-hand days that are greater than 1.5 days.the cost curves for both the dc and the system are increasing with the lowest-costsolution achieved when the target on-hand inventory at the dc is equal to 0 days. however, thislowest-cost solution is not feasible because it does not satisfy the constraint of a minimum 95%ifr at the dc. for the target on-hand days greater than 0, the total relevant cost for the systemincreases as a result of the increases of the inventory holding costs and the shrinkage costs atboth the dc and the retail stores. as the target days on-hand inventory increases, the dc holdsmore inventory of an older age, which is then sent to the retail stores resulting in highershrinkage costs at the retail stores.based on the costs and ifrs observed, we determined that the reasonable range for targeton-hand inventory at the dc is between 0 to 4.5 days. this is because for target on-hand daysgreater than 4.5, the ifr at the dc remains relatively constant but the total relevant cost for thedc and the system shows an increasing trend. the major cost contribution comes from theincreasing inventory holding cost at the dc.4.2.3 optimal inventory at the retail stores and the dcalthough our simulation runs described in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 provide the optimal inventorypolicies at the retail stores and at the dc separately, these policies fail to consider the potentialimpact that the inventory levels have on each other. in order to find the global optimal inventorypolicy for the multi-echelon system, we must consider different combination of retail stores\\' anddc\\'s inventory policies. as explained in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, we used the individualechelon optimization results to narrow down the number of possible combinations. weconducted simulation testing to seek the combination of inventory policies at the retail store andthe dc that would result in the lowest total relevant cost for the system while still meeting theminimum 95% ifr required at the dc. table 4.8 presents the total relevant costs at differentvalues of target days on-hand inventory at the retail stores and the dc, with feasible solutions(those with ifrs greater than 95% at all echelons) highlighted in green. table 4.9 presents theassociated ifr at the dc. the base policy currently used by chiquita is highlighted in red forthese tables and all that follow. the results suggest that the optimal solution is for the retailstores and the dc to have target on-hand inventory levels of 1.5 days and 0.5 days, respectively.this yields the lowest total relevant costs while still having an ifr

for the optimal solution are highlighted in blue for all tables.table 4.9 also indicates other feasible solutions (cells marked in green) with more than95% ifr at the dc, but these solutions do not yield the lowest total relevant cost for the system.additionally, table 4.9 indicates that at the current base policy, only a 91.7% ifr is achieved bythe dc. this is consistent with current observations by chiquita that their ifr values at the dcare not satisfactory.tables 4.10 and 4.11 indicate the ifrs at each retail store for different target on-handlevels. we observe that except for the combinations with cells marked in green (which indicatethe feasible solution), the ifr at the retail stores deteriorates below 95%. retail store 2 has ahigher ifr for lower values for target days on-hand inventory at the dc. this may be due to thefact that its demand is half that of retail store 1 and thus a larger proportion of its orders may besatisfied in full by the dc. clearly, the target on-hand inventory policy of less than 1.5 days atthe retail stores results in the higher lost sales cost for the system increasing the total relevantcost.table 4.10: item fill rate at retail store

statistics for the kpi\\'s for the base policy and theoptimal policy. we ran the simulation for twenty independent replications or iterations to obtainreliable results. an explanation for the content of the columns is as follows:.. . .. ... ................................................................................................................................................................................ : .. . .. .... ..... i. average: this value indicates the average for the output variable over all twentyiterations.ii. half-width: this value helps to determine the reliability of the results for the outputvariable from all twenty iterations. this number is half of the 95% confidence intervalfor the true mean of the given kpi. thus the output indicates that the true mean is withinthe range of the observed sample mean ± the reported half width.iii. minimum average: this value indicates the minimum average value for the outputvariable from any of the twenty iterations.iv. maximum average: this value indicates the maximum average value for the outputvariable from any of the twenty iterations.v. minimum: this value indicates the absolute lowest value observed for the outputvariable across all twenty

4.18, we observe that the total relevant cost ateach retailer and for the system is statistically significantly lower and the half-widths are smallerfor the optimal policy as compared to the base policy. the dc total relevant costs are notstatistically significantly different, yet the dc ifr is statistically significantly higher. the95.24% ifr at the dc for the optimal policy with half-width of 0.45 is significantly is betterthan the 91.74% ifr with half-width of 0.59 for the base policy. further, the smaller confidenceintervals for the ifr at the dc and the total relevant cost for the system indicate that optimalpolicy would improve the reliability of the performance of the system and yield the lowest costsolution as compared to the base policy.there is a small decrease in ifrs at the retail store under the optimal policy as comparedto the base policy, although these ifrs under the optimal policy are still greater than 95%. thisis because the optimal solution trades off the lost sales cost with the shrinkage costs andinventory holding costs at the retail stores in order to find the lowest cost solution for the wholesystem. for example, in the case of retail store 1, we see that the shrinkage cost is reducedfrom $23.04 to $8.37 and the inventory holding costs are reduced from $26.16 to $10.48 whencomparing the base policy with optimal policy respectively. the lost sales cost increases from$1.45 for the base policy to $8.62 for the optimal policy. overall, the total relevant cost at retailstore 1 is now $27.46 for the optimal policy as compared to $50.64 for the base policy, whichtranslates into cost reduction of $23.18. additionally, the ifr under the optimal policy at theretail store 1 is 97.05% which is still greater than 95%. this means under the base policy, themajor portion of the cost comes from the shrinkage costs and inventory holding costs.considering the cost reductions across the whole system, the optimal policy yields a30.7% reduction in costs while maintaining the ifr greater than 95% at each echelon. themodel optimizes the whole system by capturing the dynamic effects of perishability andinventory levels at each echelon, resulting in significant savings without sacrificing the servicelevels.4.3 sensitivity to the forecast errorsusing the optimal inventory policies obtained during the simulation runs described in section4.2.3, 0.5 days inventory target at the dc and 1.5 days inventory target at the retail stores, wetested the sensitivity of the system to the forecast errors. testing the sensitivity of the optimalinventory policy with respect to the forecast errors demonstrates the potential benefits ofincreased forecast accuracy on reducing the inventory-related costs.4.3.1 forecast error for dc\\'s demand forecastwe conducted the sensitivity analysis by conducting simulation runs with the following inputsfor forecast error for the dc\\'s demand: 0, 5, 15, 25, 35, 50, 65, and 80%. table 4.19 presentsthe results

the availability of the inventoryat the dc and hence its ability to fulfill orders received from the retail stores. thus ifrs at boththe dc and the retail stores deteriorate for dc\\'s forecast error beyond 25%.for the dc\\'s forecast error less than 25%, the inventory level at the dc is reduced butretail stores still have their own forecast error, so retail stores still tend to order more form

so does theamount of older inventory on hand there, and hence the age of the inventory shipped to theretailers also increases. it can be clearly seen that shrinkage volume at the dc is very sensitiveto dc\\'s forecast error as compared to the shrinkage volume at the retail stores. this increasingtrend in dc\\'s shrinkage volume is obvious for the forecast error greater than 40%. thus the

accuracy at the dc and the retail stores can reduce the costs significantly and improvethe respective ifrs drastically. the forecast accuracy at the dc has greater impact than theforecast accuracy at the retail stores on the total relevant cost of the system. because of theproduction and transportation lead time at the plant, the system is more sensitive to the dc\\'sforecast error. the longer production and transportation lead time at the plant means moreforecast error will be taken into account while calculating the dc\\'s oul as opposed tocalculations with shorter lead times. this translates into the increased inventory holding cost atthe dc.however, the forecast accuracy at the retail stores has a greater impact than the forecastaccuracy at the dc on dc\\'s ifr. even if the

sensitivity of the total relevant cost to the transportation lead time from the plant tothe dc helps demonstrate the benefits of using expedited shipping services. we conducted thisexperiment with transportation lead times from the plant to the dc of 1 through 7 days. theproduction lead time is constant at 4 days which results in a cumulative lead time from the plantto the dc of 5 to 11 days.

of perishability on total inventory costs andto establish the optimal inventory policy for the multi-echelon fresh express supply chain. inthis chapter we present the challenges for perishable inventory system in a multi-echelon supplychain, the insights drawn from the use of our simulation model, and an outline for the futureextensions.5.1 challenges for perishable inventory systems in a multi-echelon supply chainthe major challenges in perishable inventory management systems reside in tracking theinventory distribution of different age-groups. the multi-echelon system further complicates theissue as the interaction between each echelon of the supply chain makes the issue dynamic anddifficult to monitor and understand. addressing these issues analytically requires extensivecomputations, thus analytical approaches are usually impractical for day-to-day operations in acomplex inventory system.utilizing a simulation model is extremely useful in dealing with perishable inventory inmulti-echelon supply chains because tracking the inventory distribution and the inventorytransfer becomes relatively simple using computer software. a computer simulation model alsohelps the user to monitor the interactions and influence between each echelon of the supplychain. additional benefits of a simulation approach are that we can test the sensitivity of thesystem to varying conditions, and that we can obtain 95% confidence intervals for the outputvariables, which indicate the reliability of the estimate.5.2 key insightswe have discussed many of our key results in chapter 4, and we highlight key insights in thissection.5.2.1 service level at the dc vs. inventory at the retail storesthe simulations reveal that the ifr at the dc is sensitive to the target days on-hand inventory atthe retails stores. as the target days on-hand inventory at the retail stores increases, the ifr atthe dc decreases significantly. the dynamics of the demand variability, the forecast errors, andthe shrinkage in the multi-echelon system amplify as the target days on-hand inventory at theretail stores increases. as a result of the dynamics of these three factors, the ifr at the dcdeteriorates when the target days on-hand inventory at the retail stores increases past two days.the model suggests the retail store to keep its inventory less than two days to minimize theupstream impact of the demand variability, the forecast errors, the production schedule and theshrinkage.5.2.2 base scenario policy vs. optimal inventory policyone of the three key questions posed by chiquita is what the optimal inventory levels areconsidering forecast accuracy, transportation lead-time, inventory carrying cost, lost sales costsand inventory shrinkage costs due to product perishability. our simulation model considers allthese factors and determines that the optimal inventory policy would be to set the target days on-hand inventory to be 0.5 days at the dc and 1.5 days at the retail stores. comparing this optimalsolution to the current inventory policy, the inventory policy determined by our simulation modelreduces the total relevant cost by 30.7%, reduces the shrinkage below 8.5%, and maintains theifr above the required 95% at all echelons.chiquita has been considering moving to a cross-dock policy at the dc, which means thedc will not carry any inventory. our model indicates that by removing inventory from the dc,a cross-dock policy would reduce the total relevant costs by approximately 0.05%. comparingwith the 30.7% cost saving from the optimal policy, an additional 0.05% saving is relativelyinsignificant. in addition, our model shows that the cross-dock policy would reduce the ifr atboth the retail stores. in particular, the ifr at the retail store 1 would be reduced from 97.1% to93.2%, below the target ifr of 95%. therefore, based on the results, we would not recommendchiquita and abc to introduce a cross-dock policy at the dc unless it makes other changes to itsordering and logistics to maintain sufficient ifrs.5.2.3 service levels vs. inventory costanother question posed by chiquita is the trade-off between service levels and inventory cost.as we expected, the service levels and inventory costs have a positive correlation. we determineour model\\'s optimal inventory policy by selecting the policy that results in the lowest totalrelevant cost and still meets the minimum service level of 95% ifr. the optimal inventorypolicy improves the ifr at the dc from 91.74% to 95.24%, while the ifr at the retail storesdecreases from 99% to 97%.although the ifr at the retail stores decreases by approximately 2%, 97% is stillconsidered high customer service level. however, the impact of a reduction of 2% in ifr onconsumer satisfaction and good-will are not captured in our model. chiquita and abc shouldgain a better understanding of the potential impact on consumer behavior and future sales beforeimplementing the optimal inventory policy suggested by our simulation model.overall, the 30.7% cost savings are significant enough for chiquita and abc to considerreplacing the current inventory policy with the optimal inventory policy found in our model. themajority of the cost reduction comes from the reductions in inventory holding costs andinventory shrinkage costs across the system, especially at the retail stores.additionally, the confidence intervals (95%) determined by our model for the ifr andthe total relevant cost for the system are tighter in the case of the optimal inventory policy ascompared to the confidence intervals in the base scenario policy. the tighter confidenceintervals indicate less variability in the system performance.5.2.4 effect of forecast error on the relevant costs and the service levelthe third question posed by chiquita is the effect of forecast error on inventory-related costs.we found that the system is very sensitive to forecast errors, especially the forecast errors fromthe dc. in general, as the forecast accuracy deteriorates, the ifr at the dc and the retail storesdecreases and the relevant cost of the system increases. therefore, chiquita and abc shouldconsider investing significant efforts to improve the forecast accuracies at the dc and the retailstores. additionally, improving the forecast accuracy at the dc alone may not address the issuesufficiently because the dc\\'s inventory is ultimately impacted by the orders and forecastscreated by the retail stores. the ifr at the dc is more sensitive to the forecast error at the retailstores than to the dc\\'s forecast error. to maximize the cost savings and improve theperformance of the whole system, we recommend that chiquita work with abc tosimultaneously improve the forecast accuracy at both the dc and the retail stores.5.2.5 effect of transportation lead time on the relevant costs and service levelthe system is sensitive to the transportation lead time since the transportation lead time directlyimpacts the products\\' lifetime at the dc and at the retail stores. our model demonstrates that asthe transportation lead time increases, the shrinkage in the system increases significantly. thisfurther results in the increased lost sales at the retail stores and reduced ifr at the retail stores79and the dc. overall, the total relevant cost for the system increases and the ifr at each echelondeteriorates. since the system is sensitive to the transportation lead time, chiquita should notrelax the current lead time and should continue to keep the transportation lead time as short aspossible to maximize the products\\' available lifetime at the dc and the retail stores.5.3 extension of the model and future researchfurther research on perishable product supply chains can be conducted by relaxing theassumptions of our model. we have demonstrated the benefits of quantitative approach toimproving the service levels at each echelon and reducing the total relevant cost of the system.further extension of our research by exploring the following possibilities can extend the benefitsto the perishable product supply chains.5.3.1 mandated shrinkage policy at the dccurrently, abc has mandated an inventory shrinkage policy at the dc, in which any productthat has less than six days of shelf life remaining should be removed from the dc\\'s inventory.testing the sensitivity of the system with respect to this mandated inventory shrinkage policy atthe dc could help chiquita to understand the impact of this policy on the ifr at each individualechelon and the total relevant cost for the system.5.3.2 other product familiesour simulation is based on one of fresh express\\' main product families. the results generatedfrom using this product family should provide a good overall representation of the whole freshexpress product lines. however, chiquita can use the simulation model to test other productfamilies or each individual product to gain a deeper understanding of its supply chain.5.3.3 other fresh express supply chainsour simulation is also based on one of fresh express\\' main customers, which we refer to asabc inc. this supply chain is similar to chiquita\\'s other supply chains for other customers.however, some of the inventory policies, such as abc\\'s mandated shrinkage policy at the dc,might be different for other customer\\'s supply chains. chiquita can conceivably change theinput parameters in the model to determine the optimal inventory policy for its other supplychains.5.3.4 demand correlation among complementary productsin our model, we assumed independent demand that is normally distributed for each product, butdifferent demand distributions can be considered for further research. for example, it is possibleto analyze and incorporate correlated demand for complementary products.5.3.5 first in first out policyour model assumes a fifo product policy; however, in reality if there are products withdifferent lifetime displayed on the shelf, some consumers would look for and purchase theyounger products. such consumer behavior is not captured in our current model. chiquita andits customers can either develop rules to expand our model to capture such behaviors or developstore shelf stocking policies to better control consumers\\' purchasing behaviors if needed.5.3.6 production capacity of the plantin our model, we assumed that the plant has unlimited production capacity to fulfill dc\\'s orders,but this assumption can be relaxed if an additional echelon is built into the model. this may bevaluable since the plant serves other dc\\'s if it has limited production capacity5.4 summarywe conclude that for multi-echelon perishable inventory management problems, simulation canbe extremely helpful. our research demonstrates that simulation modeling can quantify varioustrade-offs involved in making inventory management decisions for perishable products. it isextremely valuable to simulate reality and test the sensitivity of the system before decisions aremade by managers. simulation modeling can lead to optimal solutions that would reduce thesystem costs significantly while improving the system performance significantly.reference listclark, a. j., and scarf, h. 1960. optimal policies for a multi-echelon inventory problem.management science, 6 (4), 475-490.cohen m. a.

the retail stores. asmentioned earlier in section 3.1.4, we assume that the dc treats all the retail stores equally anddoes not prioritize a particular store over another. the algorithm steps are:1. if the dc\\'s inventory level is more than the aggregated retail store orders, the dc fulfillseach order 100% accordingly.2. if the dc\\'s inventory level is less than the aggregated retail store orders, the dc checkswhether both orders each are more than 50% of the inventory level.2.1 if yes: the dc will split the inventory 50/50 (evenly) and ship out the inventoryaccordingly to each retail

discussed in our thesis.the simulation model was implemented using arena software and microsoft excel d 2007. wedivide the appendix into the following sections.b. 1 introduction to the fresh express

arenab.3.2 built-in reports in arenab.3.3 user customized results in excelb.4 sensitivity testing setupfor additional information on arena software and the features offered beyond the scopeof this appendix, we recommend the user to refer to the manual provided by rockwellautomation, the manufacturer of arena software.b.1 introduction to the fresh express arena simulation modelarena is a discrete-event systems simulation tool and it was used to program and simulatechiquita\\'s fresh express supply chain for the purposes of this thesis. a microsoft excel filewas used feed the input parameters into this arena model. in this excel file, the model user canspecify the input parameters specific to each individual echelon of supply chain that wediscussed in chapter 4. the arena simulation model reads these input parameters beforerunning the simulation. to that end, we have integrated the excel file with the arena simulationmodel.additionally, the user needs to setup replication parameters for the arena simulationmodel. at the end of simulation runs, arena provides results for the output variables usingarena\\'s built-in reports. users can also obtain results for the specific output variables at therequired level of granularity, provided a specific output file and the output format are specified tothe model by the intended user. the sections below provide more details regarding the processinvolved.b.2 setting up the modelthis section provides details regarding the input parameters to be specified by the model user.b.2.1 excel input parameters for the supply chainas mentioned in section b. 1, the user needs to specify the input parameters specific to thesupply chain in file the inputdatafile.xls. figure b. 1 (a) shows the screenshot of this file andthe input parameters to be specified by the user. the user needs to specify a valid data value foreach of the cells marked in yellow. we have defined a valid range for each of these input datacells. if the user enters any incorrect value (for example, negative values) into these cells, aninput error messages twill appear to the user. the user needs to resolve any errors that areprompted before proceeding to the actual arena simulation.the user is allowed to enter data only in the inputdata tab. the testme tab as shown infigure b. 1 (b) is protected and used for the calculations explained in section 3.1.5 (figure 3.1).the arena simulation model reads the data from this tab. figure b.1 (c) shows how to select andsetup the file inputdatafile.xls in arena.0 c -(d wlwie cl 9k kitak4-jqoga azt

excel file with input parameters as mentioned section b.2. 1, the user alsoneeds to setup the replication parameters for the simulation model. figure b.2 shows thescreenshot from arena where the user needs to specify these parameters.hi dtvie* t0,04 amw~~ otec (e wmndoa h*irun setuprun speed i fcomoi pepospned pmwnts repleabon pawame ma suessat dae and tuneajuay -2-10 12 0000 amwamvp ped tune

number ofreplications: this indicates the number of independent iterations orreplications the simulation model is required to perform before producing final set ofresults. we recommend 20 replications to capture the variability in the system andproduce reliable results. this means that the simulation model will run twenty times with95.............. ....... . . .. ................... . -a different set of random data every time and at the end of 2 0 th replication it will producethe results for user-specified output variables.ii. start date and time: this indicates the beginning date and time for the simulation run.for example, if we want to conduct the simulation for 365 days in future, the start dateand time indicates the very first day on which the simulation begins.iii. warm-up period: in general, for simulating the situations that do not start withoutinventory or material in process, the user needs specify warm-up period. for thesimulation model discussed in this thesis, we recommend 30 days of warm-up, which wedetermined through tests. this means that the statistics collected over first 30 days willnot be counted towards final performance measures reported at the end of simulationruns. in other words, the simulation model requires 30 days to stabilize the system andstart performing close to the average conditions of the system that match with reality.iv. replication length: this indicates the duration for which user would like to conduct thesimulation. for example, we wanted to collect data from the simulation for 1 year.given that we had 30 days of warm-up, the replication length was set to 395 days. theuser needs to account for the warm-up period while setting the replication length.b.3 running the modelafter successfully completing the process in sections b.l and b.2, the user can proceed torunning the model.b.3.1 running the model in arenathe user should first check the model for any errors as a routine procedure. if no changes arebeing made to the model and procedure mentioned above is correctly followed by the user, thereshould be no errors. figure b.3 shows how to check the model for errors in arena. the user96should get the message no errors or warnings in model as shown below. if there are any errors,the user should review those errors and resolve them before running the simulation model.fie edt vitw tools anange object widow help17 c~

in figure b.3. alternatively, the user can select the arrowsas shown in figure b.4 below to start the simulation run in normal mode or fast-forward mode.running the model in fast-forward modes saves significant amount of time. if the user wants toview the animation, then simulation speed can be controlled (slowed down) using the bar shownin figure b.4. using animation increases the time required

display of resultsat the end of simulation run can be set by the user under reports as shown in figure b.2.arenathe simulation has run to completion.,- would you like to see the results?yes nofigure b.5: result message prompt by arenain general, the user can specify some statistics to be collected under project parametersas shown in figure b.2. figure b.6 and b.7 indicate how to collect statistics for already-existingvariables in the model and the custom variables defined by the user for the purpose of this model.for most of the variables in this model, the statistics collection is turned on by selecting thereport statistics check-box for variable under the basic processes panel as shown in the figureb.6. the user can see the complete list of variables in the model and select the statistics forvariables that are of interest. additionally, the user can specify new or custom variables that areof interest under the statistics option which is listed under the advanced process panel as shownin figure b.7. we have created four custom variables, which are the total relevant cost for thedc, retail store 1, retail store 2 and the system.file edit view tools arrange object run

in the figure b.9b. 3.3 user-customized results in excelthe user can develop an additional program in the arena model for exporting any specific outputvariables at a different level of detail (daily, monthly, etc.) than the level reported in arena\\'sbuilt-in reports if needed. we developed a program to export daily results for few output100co q>variables as shown in figure b.10. the default export starts after warm-up period of 30 days,but the user can change it that if needed. for example, if the user is interested in reviewing theifr at the dc for each individual day simulated in arena and for all twenty iterations, then theexcel file outputdatafile.xls will contain those results as shown in figure b. 11. the user needsto specify this filename in arena as shown in figure b. 1 (c). this makes the simulationextremely slow; on our laptop computer, a simulation run takes 1 minute without this additionalexport versus 120 minutes with export. we do not recommend exporting these types ofadditional results unless it is extremely necessary for the purpose of analysis. results reported inarena\\'s built-in reports are generally sufficient for the purpose of analysis.figure b.10:

chain organization, cyber security, warehouse, automation, and supplier relations i. introduction according to information technology consulting corporations, microsoft\\'s azure in cloud computing arises as a rapid increase in technology that many organizations are ready to assume to progress the efficiency of the companies [1]. investment in current technologies, for instance, cloud figuring, is rapidly growing at eighteen percent annually. at the same time, it is estimated to reach at least eighty percent of information technology by 2025. the use of microsoft azure is evolving per year in various companies. the investigations indicate that seventy-two percent of the participating organizations had already substantially implemented cloud technologies, especially microsoft azure. at the same time, some organization is still piloting all project on their works and analyzing both benefits and challenges of the technology [2]. the application of microsoft azure in supply chain management and retail warehouse distribution have been performing in which it has led to a large-scale transformation in traditional warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management, leading such organizations to innovate more dynamic retail distribution.  the research indicated various activities that the microsoft azure providers incorporate, including forecasting, planning sourcing and procurement, spare parts maintenance, and logistics, considered the first move in the cloud [3]. involving microsoft azure\\'s cloud-based technology in warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management has contributed many advantages such as simplified operations, capital investment, time visibility, and scalability. however, before applying veil computing technology in supply chain management and retail distribution, limitations and risks such as confidential material and weak data awareness should be considered. many companies are utilizing cloud computing from the private to the public stage, enabling an organization to benefit from the competitive advantage of implementing cloud interaction. ii. methodology this research depends on secondary, for instance, reference materials, research papers, and conference proceedings, such as all forms of reliable statistics that determine this paper\\'s determination [4]. thus, this paper has an overview and a summary of the use of microsoft azure as cloud computing in supply chain organization and retail warehouse distribution and the relationship between the use of microsoft azure and supply chain performance. in addition to the case study, the researchers interviewed cloud providers on their views on supply chain international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248‐9738 , vol‐3, issue‐4 20  transparency and its related risk in cloud computing [5-7]. from the analysis of participants\\' responses to the case study and interviews, their collected some transparency structures that could be useful in comparing cloud providers based on the data they published on their websites. the results discussion, conclusions, and recommendation. a. cloud computing when mentioning cloud computing, it is essential to indicate both software that cloud benefactors can give to their customers and hardware. cloud computing is an information technology service model that can provide computing services either by hardware or software and deliver information on demand to customers independently [8]. customers can access cloud-based applications via web browsers, whereas data and software are kept in the servers\\' locations. cloud figuring can be characterized into four types: isolated cloud totaling, open cloud computing, hybrid cloud totaling, and community [9]. the advantage of public computing against supply chain management is that organizations are not concerned about system maintenance or construction.  fig 1: warehouse management system with cloud  public cloud computing in the distribution of retail warehouses is designed for open usage by the public. public cloud computing can be operated and managed by companies and several partners; public cloud exists outside of the locations of the cloud providers. using public cloud computing, users can achieve a cheaper setup application since third-party providers cover the cost [10]. while private cloud computing is on the premises of the cloud arrangement where operators of diverse business components retrieve it within the institute, the importance of using private cloud computing to develop privacy from the internal computing sources operating within the company [11]. therefore, the need for higher security levels and lower risk has been perfect since it limits the number of users. several customers have preferred private cloud computing over public cloud computing because of its flexibility and security.  hybrid cloud computing is the grouping of public cloud and isolated cloud. in a hybrid cloud, there is two different cloud structure, whereas the remaining exclusive units are combined by the consistent technology that permits application and data to be portable. in hybrid cloud computing, the organization can sustain its isolated cloud and scale out the public; if the local volume is well utilized or in-the-house arrangements cannot support the workload, then an external system can provide alternative support [12]. hybrid cloud figuring can stabilize the risks and benefits between public and private cloud computing and manage the cost of infrastructure in supply chain organizations and retail warehouse distribution. cloud computing is only designed for companies with common goals, such as security necessities and regulatory obedience [13]. communal cloud computing can be accomplished by more or a single party of the community or a combination of both. community cloud computing can be hosted either externally or internally.  retailers can use microsoft azure to accept or recover any file planned for distribution with various entities, such as forms, pictures, and videotape, among other organizer kinds, or usage in a cloud presentation. microsoft azure packing can even accommodate the categories of facts usually defined as big data, like underdone data from systematic tools or records from attendants [14]. even holdups from record attendants and other campaigns, as well as computer-generated challenging energies for extra to simulated apparatuses, can be positioned in splotch storing. enables improved provision of a devolved industry traversing numerous places can transfer international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248‐9738 , vol‐3, issue‐4 21  information technology economics from conservation to allow for novelty. a solitary combined suite, eliminating the necessity to mix different schemes, enables improved teamwork with dealers, consumers, and networks. the use of microsoft azure in warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management consists of three unlike prototypes, which include organization as a provision, software as an amenity, and stage as services in which each of sieving various requirements of the microsoft users. b. improved data security in the warehouse the retailers obtain a nonstop flow of clients each time, and statistics are produced continuously. cloud figuring is vibrant to accomplish such a massive volume of facts made by transactions, standard facts, and so on [10]. furthermore, such business-delicate information must be cautiously controlled. a critical reason for corporate disappointment is the cost of private corporate statistics, individually recognizable information via system penetration, outbreaks of the most mutual attacks on supercomputers and the system/attendant, and ransomware contaminating structures and negotiations statistics.information safety is a single significant issue to be talked about. some retailers uphold their transactions facts, account intelligence, and purchaser response, among others, on the resident attendants [15]. while it is suggested that keeping facts on the cloud helps protect the information through advanced firewalls, encryption, occasion classification, internal firewalls, and external security. c. improved buyer experience in the logistics world, the vendors only partially use the client and transaction information that they gather. the cloud amenities supplier uses dynamic computing capitals and arithmetical representations to examine facts [16]. with its massive file, vendors can influence the points from the linked strategies to explore the ordering conduct, styles, and connections with theproduct to advance a reasonable superiority in policymaking. utilizing client information analytics aimed at analytical acquisitions, retailers can forecast their clients\\' purchasing performance and what goods they purchase each time. if they buy reduced produces, what is the variety of the products they purchase? these figures are kept on the cloud, and by consuming analytics, merchants grow their promotion or selling approaches to appeal to additional consumers [17]. the practice of statistics analytics has increased, with the cloud being safe, dependable, and inexpensive for information storage and dispensation. infrastructure as a service administration through cloud computing presented essential changes in cooperative relations, beliefs, and message positions. the consequences presented extraordinary results for huge administrations using cloud figuring amid harmonious concerns and interpersonal results [18]. logistics directors from great establishments supposed that administrations utilizing cloud computing produced higher interpersonal results. infrastructure as a provision is a platform where businesses can display their products in the method of attendants, storing, universe, and hardware at remuneration per usage provision. these services are ideal the microsoft azure suppliers them in the paper of a virtual machine to raw storage or physical firewalls, networks, and load balances [19]. many users buy these models as outsourced services instead of software and networking equipment servers to monitor the organization. a perfect example is amazon cloud aws and microsoft azure. d. platform as a service microsoft azure provides a host for computing settings, typically operating system programming language and database, where the users deploy and develop the application. customers can lease virtual attendants to create and organize the current application. in some circumstances, the storage and figure properties are gauged routinely to acquire presentation requests. for instance, cloud customers do not have to distribute resources physically [20]. software as service(saas) mode cloud providers operate and install presentation software in the mist, and customers use the software on many customers\\' tools via the thin client interface. for instance, program interface and computing resources are accessed by various customers using one of the models. technology, cloud figuring is typical for allowing universal, practical, on-request system admission to a public pond of configurable adding international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248‐9738 , vol‐3, issue‐4 22  assets submissions that can be quickly provided and unconstrained through negligible administration energy or amenity supplier interface. prominently, it energetically poises to encounter the present request, whether the market outcomes from the performance of a supply-rigorous presentation by a sole operator or the unexpected arrival of numerous customers demanding entrance to a unified mutual source.  fig 2: software as a service  likewise, cloud assets can be free once request starts to reduce [21]. taking a cloud organization implies that researchers should not concern with having or acquisition of the abilities to shape, achieve, and uphold a central and climbable situation. in its place, they can depend on unceasing contact with a data epicenter acquired by a third party. instead of participating frankly to protect the essential hardware for an organization accomplished of supportive calculating science, investigators can, in its place, recompense for admission to the cloud totaling only as the necessity rises. microsoft azure\\'s contact with massive ranges of achieved assets is an extra convincing cloud feature for scholars [22]. cloud computing stages uphold the organization besides amenities on which claims are operated, such as functioning schemes and record facilities. since all hardware is inattentive by the cloud podium, there is no addiction to any exact portion of hardware. so, sellers can relate covers and improve workings without unfavorably affecting management. iii. cloud-influence in supply chain activities the presentation of the microsoft azure notion in supply sequence organization and retail warehouse distribution generates and innovates new fields that can be linked to two parties by delivering related information and cloud facilities. planning and forecasting. microsoft azure platforms are helping an organization to advance their services by organizing the sequence associates. such as supplier retailers and distributors, who play a vital role in demand forecasting. microsoft azure gathers sales through the internet, performs simple analytics, and executes an accurate statistical demand forecast to various supply participants. the gathering of information through the internet leads to a significant decrease in the bullwhip effect in the supply chain [23], which contributes to the distortion of critical information in various stages of supply chain management. therefore, enabling all the partners involved in supply to be conscious of the actual claim instability so that they can manage the situation. microsoft azure provides a solution for the order planning and demand combine and prediction implementation submissions to one solitary multi-party podium. the customer makes an order; supplies send the information to the public cloud making the data available simultaneously to all supply chains.  a. sourcing and procurement  sourcing includes receipt, attainment, and examination of received resources, identifying the obtaining process, and choosing suitable dealers. in this section, microsoft, the azure platform, can operate a database with various suppliers\\' data. microsoft provides a significant boost for companies dealing with many supply materials. organizations can choose their supplies depending on the appropriate materials provided according to time limits and specifications [24]. cloud computing enables stores and organizations to develop contracts, mutually enlightening contract management. b. logistics microsoft azure is useful for inventory, transportation, and warehouse management. the use of microsoft azure for logistics tracking various supply sequence associates. procedures such as scheduling fleet management, command international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248‐9738 , vol‐3, issue‐4 23  handling, conveyance course preparation, and worldwide compliance can be transferred to a cloud computing base[25]. a sole integrated cloud platform has more advantages to the transport sector because it limits pipeline inventory and the hand logistics sector [26]. cloud services are essential for supply companies for itineraries. cloud computing provides solutions to warehousing management due to many different customers at the same tie in one system.  c. service and utility management reverse logistics should be final in supply chain management; reverse logistics should be considered since it increases profits.   microsoft azure as cloud computing provides an opportunity for organizations to integrate advancing logistics (see fig 3) through converse logistics in the warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management [27]. for instance, radio occurrence identification is an intelligence knowledge container used to pathway inventory location and later transmit information to the cloud application. moreover, the inventory route can be observable to all supply chain management, from customers to manufacturers and vice versa. the returns processing, warranty proof, spare parts record, and technician report are the only progressions presented efficiently in a sole cloud-based stage.   fig 3: manufacturing automation flow  many organizations reflect the manufacturing technique as their extensive supply chain stage. cloud computing may be proven unsuitable for manufacturing because of its complex essential procedure that requires a high level of degree customization that the cloud-based cannot offer [28]. iv. cloud computing in third-party logistics services after debating primarily about the potential for cloud-computing suggestions in supply chain organization and retail warehouse distribution, precisely the issues that technology contributes to companies. the reflectiveness of inventory and shipments either inside the company s boundaries among the source chain and retail warehouse stakeholders[29]. cloud multiplying as a public, hybrid, or private cloud assembly can provide internal or external reflectiveness, which enhances with consequences and benefits as discussed below (fig 4).   fig 4: extended supply chain in the cloud era[29]  v. cloud multiplying on scm and warehouse retail distribution changing an ancient source chain in an organization should determine the mechanical needs for shifting the source chain to the cloud and transforming the supply chain to microsoft azure, as cloud computing can be implemented by employing a cloud life cycle, a development lifecycle with numerous steps that make it possible for the transformation process to be evaluated and developed regularly. nevertheless, before the transformational process, organizations should consider all the functional aspects that can make them create an overview of microsoft azure\\'s execution in the supply chain management process[30]. queries about the modifications, the advantages, and the challenges that are likely to be encountered when using microsoft azure should be considered before an organization takes any vital decision when moving to cloud computing. the subtopics below address the positive impacts of microsoft azure as cloud computing and the challenges likely to be international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248‐9738 , vol‐3, issue‐4 24  encountered when employing cloud-based technologies.further, the positive aspects of cloud adaption are defined below.  a. cost efficiency microsoft azure as a cloud computing system can be employed effectively because it has numerous financial advantages for organizations using the technology. cloud facilities do not need any venture for software or device control possession. thus, microsoft azure is more beneficial than regular in-house enterprise resource planning structures provided by public clouds[31]. as a result, supply chain management capital cost can be shifted to operational expenditure, improving organizational cash flow. thus, organizations must only pay activation and usage fees to install microsoft azure systems. this ensures that a company will save more resources by minimizing maintenance costs and ensuring minimal upgrade costs.   b. simplification.  microsoft azure, as a cloud computing system, simplifies the organization. the system ensures that each part of the supply series is easily accessible via the same podium[32]. moreover, the system eliminates compatibility issues to simplify the connection process and enhance information sharing among participants in a specific supply chain. thus, the organization benefits from a collaborative community that improves security by allowing participants to set security[33]. the system minimizes the response time when making decisions between two or more participants. cloud-founded services provide information regulation via one centralized storage structure to ensure a smooth flow of information in the supply chain.  c. flexibility  the cloud computing system provides flexibility from demand projection to transportation or warehouse management. the demand prediction process, warehouse, and transport management involve numerous applications in the supply chain, which can be boosted in one cloud-founded platform. furthermore, microsoft azure ensures that participants can access such a stage from various organizational environments through a standard device despite the different geographical locations[34]. management of microsoft azure is location-independent; hence can be accessed from other geographical areas. the extensive network availability alerts the entire supply chain, making the company swiftly enter a fresh market with new products and services.  d. visibility implementing microsoft azure in an organization offers timely linking with numerous supply chain partners. thus, an organization can monitor the supply chain occurrences when they occur and deal with possible issues or deviations from the main goals [35]. visibility is critical because it ensures that organizations can organize their activities and oversee various customers while providing the customer network has a clear view of the entire supply chain process. the organization also benefits from real-time inventory visibility to improve logistic trailing [36]. microsoft azure acts as a simulated warehouse for specific goods, such as those in the pipeline, enabling the firm to meet strategic order decisions. moreover, it becomes easy for the organization to reroute the inventory as guided by the actual product location. vi. riskand limitations microsoft azure, being a cloud-based technology, faces the problem of information safety and confidentiality. data in the cloud should only be retrieved by accredited bodies such as trusted supply chain participants [37]. nevertheless, cloud figuring structures as software items cannot continuously be responsible for discretion and privacy due to the rise in cyber security issues such as hacking[38]. moreover, the advanced modern technology makes it possible for competitors to access crucial data from other organizations, threatening the entire supply chain process. a. outdated mindset information and data distribution with public entities results in an immediate change in the ancient methods of thinking and working, which is vital in an organization\\'s culture. research shows that most organizations must disclose information concerning their production international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248‐9738 , vol‐3, issue‐4 25  procedures or supply chain processes[39]. if competitors access such information, the organization can lose its competitive advantage. implementing microsoft azure in supply chain management implies that a new change is introduced in the organization, which modifies the entire supply chain process[40]. therefore, the organization must train its employees about the new technology to ensure a successful transition process. thus, more adequate resources are needed to speed up the transition process.  b. flexible availability the users of microsoft azure as a cloud computing technology raises issues about the impacts of a possible crash down due to the user system\\'s workload, which will interfere with the entire supply chain process. such cases can be fatal to the organization resulting in a massive loss due to any delays caused by the malfunction[41, 42]. additionally, the system can be negatively affected by poor network connectivity in different geographical locations leading to inconveniences in the supply chain process. c. customization free solutioning cloud computing technology cannot be easily customized according to the needs of the supply chain process since it usually provides a standardized service. therefore, it may be difficult for the organization to solve specific supply chain errors [43]. for instance, since the production process is a composite primary process in the supply chain process with numerous customized methods depending on the product type, there should be a high level of cloud computing customization to make the process effective[44]. thus, the absence of specialization lowers the market response and can negatively affect the company\\'s competitive advantage. vii. cloud types a. private cloud the private cloud provides computing resources distributed among various business units controlled by a single infrastructure. introducing fedex in private companies lets an organization emphasize client connection and get one border for many transaction procedures [45]. before the introduction of private cloud technology, companies encountered many difficulties regarding massive collections of information, which requires a lot of computing control to analyze. however, when cloud computing was deployed, it reduced time wastage by about sixty percent and provided a parallel execution of batch processes. fedex controls the company\\'s activities all over the sphere by enabling global demand to deliver position and worldwide list visibility [46]. the hybrid cloud in this sector allows for the company\\'s sales team an exclusive feature of a mobile solution that increases the effectiveness and improves the service of the company and the customer.  b. public cloud more than the private cloud is needed to accommodate many customers and partners; this problem encourages the introduction of the public cloud. concerning supply chain tracking, some traditional organizations use phone calls and emails to collect the required data, which does not offer timely visibility. it suffers a big blow connecting all stakeholders (banerjee, 2018). contrary to the introduction of cloud-based public platforms contributes to capable connection to all customers and supply chains (khodyakov et al.,.2018). shifting to the free cloud suggests crucial monetary welfare for companies since it reduces the cost due to the nonexistence of possession cost of services providers. the most significant advantage of a public cloud platform is that its delivered information on the timely fulfillment of orders to customers and the minimum price. a natural disaster can reduce the rate of transportation schedules for many companies; therefore, cloud technology provides a solution to such obstacles [46, 47]. shifting companies to the public cloud offer logistics management services to their customers, subsidiaries, and distributors. cloud figuring allows minor companies to portion the same amenities as more prominent o organizations. for instance, the paybacks of flexibly interrelating and achieving procedures external to the association reduce the cost of ownership of supply series partnerships. cloud computing needs the arbitrating support of supply sequence addition to achieve predictable achievement. nevertheless, there is no final sign that cloud figuring has an inspiring result on either supply chain incorporation or operating presentation [48]. a significant positive connection was established international journal of smart sensors and ad hoc networks (ijssan), issn no. 2248‐9738 , vol‐3, issue‐4 26  between supply sequence addition and functioning presentation in all symbols used. viii. recommendations microsoft azure makes warehouse and supply chain management greener and neater[49].cloud computing can be practical in supply chain organizations and retail distribution to facilitate stakeholder collaboration. forecasting on the cloud limits distortion of the demand of the actual customers. cloud computing is a relatively vast supply chain management. many microsoft azure implementations in warehouse retail distribution and supply chain management have yet to be fully discovered. business email compromises were the second most shared form of social engineering. the mainstream of social business incidents was found externally. suppliers are subjugating older strengths that have yet to be patched. the organization offers real-time visibility via shipment across the supply chain management and retail warehouse distribution. ix. conclusions adopting enabling technology, supply chain management, and retail warehouse distribution should deploy a strong network that can improve the efficiency of the operation. moreover, providing automated pick lists with coordinated devices and mobile to help reduce waste and eliminate mistakes. the organization of the workstation increases productivity since the workers have everything in one place. workstations should be deployed all techniques and designs to reduce errors, keep carriers at bay, and improve safety. supply chain management and retail warehouse distribution should optimize labor efficiency to generate effective picking plans and provide a high-volume ratio for the organization. the companies should streamline operations. to optimize and maximize all available space, companies should include taller storage units that can accommodate many goods and use standardized bins to improve the neatness and orderly of the shelves. the organization should adopt lean inventory to increase stock safety and allow suppliers to use larger quantities more often.  acknowledgment we want to thank our mentor, dr. azad ali, for giving us opportunities and providing us the opportunity to perform this research on different cloud platforms and applicability on the supply chain and keeping our requestto review this.  reference [1]

(icmem 2021)  green supply chain management in food retail industry: an exploratory study satya shah* and carmen wen centre for global logistics and sustainable scm, university of bolton, united kingdom email: s.shah@bolton.ac.uk abstract - green supply chain management (gscm) has been the focus of many scholars and researchers in recent years, all with a common interest to determine how companies\\' performances are being improved with the adoption of gscm [1]. however, in most of the studies conducted by researchers, they are mainly concerned with the gscm in manufacturing industry and less attention was given to the food retail industry. therefore, this research is relevant and intend to explore gscm further, especially in the context of malaysian food retail industry so that the results from the findings will be applicable for food retail stores to contribute to improving the companies\\' performances through gscm. although, this is the first stage exploratory research from relevant literature within this area, the paper presents the proposed conceptual framework and the research hypothesis to further expand upon in the future research studies.   keywords – green supply chain management (gscm), green logistics, food retail, waste management.    i. introduction  the overall growing concern over environmental issues had further emphasized on the importance of incorporating green and sustainable practice in the supply chain management. having this new concept, gscm encourages production of more green products alongside improving the integration of suppliers with environmental issues [2, 3]. over the years, the study of gscm had often explored in the industrial sector and hardly in other sectors such as the food retail industry. in recent years, researchers had started to focus on adopting green and environment friendly concepts in the service industry rather than manufacturing industry [4]. therefore, research relating to gscm, and food retail industry began to surface. earlier research highlighted that there is growing interest on the relation between gscm and food retail industry because food and beverage industry act as a primary industry that is most suitable to mitigate environmental impacts [5].    ii. literature review  the main purpose of conducting this literature studies is to examine the important observed research to identify various aspects of green supply chain management. secondly, the studies also aim to determine the practices and methods adopted by manufactures and good retail sectors. retailers are responsible for all supply chain processes [6]. the link between in-store activities and logistics had been identified by [7] as a major aspect to research on retailing. this finding was later affirmed by [8] through a list of sustainable retailing measures. it was then detected that the measures focus on energy, water, and waste management. some retailers do not pay serious attention on the importance of water and energy management and the impact to the environment. however, water management is important in food retail stores especially in the areas where hygiene standards are prioritized. besides water, energy management is also one of the important in-store processes that associates with keeping the environment green. in food retail industries, energy management play an important role when it comes to temperature regulating for food products such as chilled and frozen food. another study [9] had further confirmed that the key drivers of carbon dioxide gas emission in malaysia are economic growth and energy consumption [9]. as the industrial sector contributes to the malaysia\\'s economic growth, research suggested that it was not likely to reduce energy consumption as doing so may affect the economic growth to dwindle as well. the researchers suggested that energy saving methods should be emphasize and policy makers could look on other alternatives such as investing in exploratory of the renewable energy sources [9].   in malaysia, according to solid waste and public cleansing management corporation), there are approximately 16,650 tons of food waste dumped daily in landfills. in fact, the amount of food waste tends to increase by 15-20% more especially during festive seasons [10]. this food waste disposal method is beginning to raise concern of the authorities because the improper food waste management will create negative impact to the environment as greenhouse gas emission is increased due to high amount of methane and carbon dioxide produced because of natural decomposition process [11]. to tackle the issue of excess food waste, the standard and industrial research institute of malaysia (sirim) had come up with some projects with the effort of converting these food waste to generate sources of energy. besides, food waste could also be transformed into useful organic fertilizer to combat food waste issue. however, efforts from the government and ngos will not be enough. the society should play their part and be aware of the importance of food waste management for the betterment of the environment and future generations [12].    proceeding book of the 6th icmem 2021, 11-13 august 2021, bandung, indonesia isbn: 978-623-92201-2-9   © 2021  the 6th international conference on management in emerging markets (icmem 2021)  a. green supply chain management (gscm) the public has become more aware about environmental issues happening worldwide in recent years and have directed the focus onto gscm by integrating green concepts and practices into the traditional supply chain management. the main reason that drives the greening of supply chain in organisations is to address the environmental burden caused by the industry and its operations [13]. for efforts of greening the supply chain to be effective, it also depends greatly on the organization nature. there are various green supply chain practices that were identified and followed in practice in the manufacturing industries. this study intends to focus more on gscm practice in terms of cooperation with customers, green purchasing and eco design.  customer cooperation in supply chain is the extent where two parties collaborate with a mutual goal to achieve sustainable outcomes [14]. in fact, customer pressure would exist within this collaboration and play a role in influencing the organisation in adopting gscm [15]. developing a close cooperation with customers is encouraged as this collaboration could enhance and strengthen green innovations in supply chains. this approach would create a win-win opportunity to meet customer demand and improve sustainability effectively. besides that, new green innovations would surely assist firms to stay competitive in the market among their competitors [16]. the cooperation with customers would also be able to contribute positively to the food retail industry as interactions with customer is crucial in the aspect of setting environment goals and plan together with efforts of reducing environmental impact. according to studies [17], there will be a direct involvement of organisation with its customers for environmental collaboration and this will bring about joint development of environmental solutions.  green purchasing is one of the preliminary steps in addressing global environmental concern because the basics of purchasing is about acquiring the correct materials in the correct quantity or quality and at the correct time and place [18]. more specifically, green purchasing is simply acquiring environment-friendly or green products or services [19].  nowadays, green purchasing appears to be an important component of environmental and supply chain strategies. due to consumers\\' rising concerns over the environment, purchasing companies had stressed on the role of purchasing functions in improving the environmental performance by integrating environmental aspects into business and organisational dimensions in making purchasing decisions. to ensure that purchases are green and benefits the environment, the practice of green purchasing is already introduced and implemented in the industries. green purchasing creates awareness in purchasing activities by considering waste reduction and at the same time encouraging the effort of recycling and reusing certain materials [20]. the green products approach is still relatively new in malaysia [21]. there is limited research available for reference which relates to green consumer products. therefore, it is worthwhile exploring green purchasing especially in food retail industry, in terms of waste reduction and purchasing of eco-friendly machineries and materials for food production processes with the aim to control the number of toxic gases being released into the environment.   the eco concept in manufacturing a product considers the aim to reduce a product\\'s environmental effects throughout the entire life cycle [21]. it is close to impossible to design a product which does not have any impact at all to the environment, but at least, with this strategy, the eco-design approach would contribute to achieving a more sustainable future [13]. in recent years, companies are already seriously looking into producing eco-designed products to maintain competitiveness in the market, based on consumers\\' changing perceptions, needs and preferences. furthermore, the concept of eco-design also serves as a great opportunity for companies to achieve their goal of replacing harmful and hazardous materials used with materials that are more environment friendly. in the food retail industry, the gscm eco design practice plays an important role especially in the production of eco products or packaging which have the reusable and recyclable attributes. in a review [18], researchers highlighted that the adoption of eco-design practice had significantly reduced the negative impact on the environment thus improving the company\\'s ability to contribute towards sustainability. engaging suppliers in collaborative programs on eco products designing can sometimes lead to introduction of new innovative ideas pertaining to environmental technologies and materials.   b. performance outcomes in the present, the attention is now churned towards balancing between business and environmental challenges and requirements. there has been on-going research that discover and explore the impact of gscm on performance outcomes which interlinks environment and economic performances [22, 20]. however, the interlink study of gscm on environment together with social performances are rarely found in the industries. therefore, this study will focus on discovering the impact of gscm on both environment and social performances in food retail industry.  environment performance can be evaluated based on a company\\'s resources consumed, regulation compliance level, processes, products, and services towards the environment [23]. the environmental performance can be measured in terms of reduction of poisonous gas emission, solid wastes and hazardous material consumptions created by activities in the supply chain network. as there seem to be a significant connection between environmental performance with supply chain management. the implementation of gscm will improve the environmental performance for both the firm itself and to the suppliers or customers that conform to proceeding book of the 6th icmem 2021, 11-13 august 2021, bandung, indonesia isbn: 978-623-92201-2-9   © 2021  the 6th international conference on management in emerging markets (icmem 2021)  environmental regulations [24]. as there is demand for environmental performance, firms had to evaluate their performances by taking the initiative to improve on their capabilities in this aspect. other studies mentioned that there could be positive effects on environmental performance should companies focus more on both corporate environmental management and gscm [23]. to enhance environmental performance, [25] suggested that companies should engage in environmental collaborations and monitoring with the suppliers and customers at the supply chain level. therefore, this study investigates whether there will be a similar positive impact of gscm on environmental performance specific to food retail industry.  social performance in general can be perceived as a measure of social related issues that brings about the attention of the society [26]. there are various social related concerns that a firm should consider along with the implementation of gscm practices. according to [27], even though social performance is recognised for its importance, however, studies on this aspect is rarely found with the reason being that it can be quite a challenge to measure this performance based on social indicators. social issues found in supply chain was defined by [28] as the effect of product or process-related aspects of operation on human safety, welfare, and community development. as there could be other metrics of measures possibly available for evaluating social performance, the metrics could be identified and selected by different dimensions [29]. due to the limited number of studies available for reference, the impact of gscm on social performance is yet to be assessed in this study that focus on food retail industry and the findings will be reported accordingly.  iii. proposed research framework  for many years, there are many studies carried out that highlights the importance of the relationships among experiences, the green supply chain management practices, and firm\\'s performances [30, 31]. only a few similar works were done in the context of food retail industry [20, 32]. however, detailed analysis was carried out on different sets of relationship between the individual antecedents with individual gscm practice and, individual gscm practice with individual variables of performance outcomes. this research studies provide the importance of various attributes of green supply chain management practices and the performance variables. hence, the study intends to contribute to a continuation of the previous research results and step up to the next level by identifying and verifying the relationship and impact of gscm on other performance outcomes, in this case is environmental and social performances. the core of this study can be represented with a simple conceptual framework to connect the variables of interest. in this case, the backgrounds here are the in-store logistics referring to environmental and waste management. these two backgrounds encourage further implementation of gscm practices which are cooperation with customers, green purchasing and eco-design that forms the central structure of the framework. the final part of the study will relate to the performance outcomes, environmental and social performance. there are multiple individual relationships to be investigated and each one is represented as an individual hypothesis. the in-store logistic measures are assumed to directly drive the practice of gscm thus forming the hypothesis to be explore in future research. the conceptual framework summarised by the individual relationships of study indicated by the arrows connecting the variables.   fig. 1.  research conceptual framework  \\uf0a7 h1a – water and energy management positively affects cooperation of customers. \\uf0a7 h1b – water and energy management positively affects green purchasing. \\uf0a7 h1c – water and energy management positively affects eco-design.  \\uf0a7 h2a – waste management positively affects cooperation of customers. \\uf0a7 h2b – waste management positively affects green purchasing. \\uf0a7 h2c – waste management positively affects eco-design.    the above connection formed between in-store logistics and gscm practices are further extended to link the relationship with the environmental and social performance of the firm. it is believed that the cooperation of customers, green purchasing and eco-design should lead to improving the environmental and social performances. thus, the formulation of the remaining hypotheses as:  \\uf0a7 h3a – cooperation with customers positively affects the environmental performance. \\uf0a7 h3b – cooperation with customers positively affects the social performance. \\uf0a7 h4a – green purchasing positively affects the environmental performance. \\uf0a7 h4b – green purchasing positively affects the social performance. proceeding book of the 6th icmem 2021, 11-13 august 2021, bandung, indonesia isbn: 978-623-92201-2-9   © 2021  the 6th international conference on management in emerging markets (icmem 2021)  \\uf0a7 h5a – eco-design positively affects the environmental performance. \\uf0a7 h5b – eco-design positively affects the social performance.  iv. conclusion and future research  with the limited number of earlier studies found studying green supply chain management (gscm) within food retail industry, a preliminary conclusion can be drawn that even though gscm is widely known and implemented in companies, it could rarely be taken for the food retail industry. the in-store logistics that are potential impacts on gscm practices were identified and justified the importance of implementing gscm practices in business and organisational operations. however, there are various gscm practices that a company can adopt depending on their organizational needs, business functions and nature. in this study, three gscm practices such as cooperation with customers, green purchasing and eco-design are chosen as the focus due to these variables are important components to be concerned of in the company when incorporating green concept in the organisation. past research revealed that gscm practices tend to affect environmental performance in the industries. however, limited evidence was found relating to social performance as not many studies were done in the aspect. therefore, in food retail industry, the findings obtained at the end of this study shall be able to provide a better picture whether gscm practices are able to contribute on improving company\\'s performance outcomes.  this research focuses on food retail industries in malaysia. however, the area of study in malaysia itself is too wide. being a country comprising of 14 states, the area of study for this research has been narrowed down and penang is selected as the prime location for data collection. penang is well-known for being the food capital of malaysia, thus food retail industry tends to occupy a relatively big market. in fact, penang was also previously reported as one of the top three states with the highest retail sub-sector occupancy. there are several studies that explored the concepts of gscm, including its implications and applications. in malaysia, studies related to gscm in food retail industry is indeed very rare. this research, in trying to establish the association between green in-store logistics and food retail industry performance outcome due to the implementation of green supply chain management, produces the results that should contribute to enhancing the management focus on adopting green concepts and cultures in supply chain management of food retail industry. the study aimed to identify various aspects of green supply chain management practices through comprehensive review of literature based on the outcomes of various studies carried out within the context of food retail and food manufacturing environments. through our study it was noted that many researchers have proposed different framework based on the specific criteria and attributes within their context, and one which can be taken as the basis of future work for our research studies. one of the other aspects for future research could also examine the managerial and strategic implications on the adoption of gscm practices within food retail sector. it should aim to inform and provide key decision makers, including management on any patters of observations and practices to be adopted by retailers. businesses could be able to explore any drivers and barriers towards adoption of these methods and frameworks to enable them towards their future retail practices and user experiences towards green practices. finally, like any research or conceptual studies, our study also has few limitations. although, our study adopted a systematic approach towards researching the existing knowledge and articles, the authors do envisage some gaps that could be further explored by future research studies. for example, a social dimension study on the impact and behaviours of individuals and users from different cultural, social and usage backgrounds can be explored in future. similarly, demographic, and behavioral studies may also be explored as a dimension in the future. future researchers and studies are encouraged to focus on both conceptual and empirical studies to further examine and evaluate the concepts of green supply chain management practices.  references  [1] q. zhu, j. sarkis, k. h. lai, \"green supply chain management innovation diffusion and its relationship to organizational improvement: an

increasing profitability and productivity.  advancements in technology and workflows in recent years have enabled distributors, suppliers, and retailers to operate more efficiently and effectively.  although significant technological advancements have been made in supply chain management, inventory management still causes a number of problems for retailers.  the average out-of -stock rate nationally is approximately at an 8% level (corsten & gruen, 2003).  inadequate inventory management can reduce retail sales, drive up costs associated with transportation and storage, decrease customer loyalty, and ultimately lead to a significant loss in revenue for the retailer.   rfid is an emerging technology that has recently begun to emerge as a tool to improve supply chain management and logistics in the consumer packaged goods industry.  while the technology has met resistance in its implementation, its benefits still show promise in its ability to improve communication and workflows.    the purpose of this study is to establish the need for increased information system technology in the purchasing, merchandising, and distribution practices which are currently being utilized by retailers and mass merchandisers.  this study will analyze current distribution and supply chain frameworks and determine the most efficient and cost effective measures that organizations can implement to the supply chain and determine if technology such as rfid can be more efficient and produce an acceptable return on investment.     iv  acknowledgements  i would like to acknowledge

which provides a retailer the opportunity to manage all costs associated with raw material sourcing, manufacturing, handling, storing, and redistribution of product.  supply chain management plays an integral part in improving the effectiveness which organizations manufacture and deliver products to business partners and consumers.  the ultimate goal of effective supply chain management is to provide the consumer with the product that they want, when they want it, and at a competitive delivered price.    there are numerous tools and processes utilized by retailers in supply chain management including universal product code (upc), vendor managed inventory (vmi), and handheld devices (smart handheld).    the most common tool of a replenishment system is the universal product code or upc.  upc provides a standardized method for identifying products and product description.  they allow retailers to keep track of products that the retailer receives and sells.  upc helps improve on-hand quantities and track products moving in and out of the store.   many retailers have also utilized additional inventory mechanisms, including vendor managed inventory, or vmi.  vmi is the process where the vendor manages the inventory and replenishment of the retailer\\'s inventory.  vmi was designed to improve the product flow between the vendor and retailer.  some retailers also incorporate a handheld device, these are portable computers and order transmission devices.  handheld devices allow stores to manually update inventory levels and order product.   effective supply chain management technology  2 recently, more advanced technology has emerged in the consumer packaged goods industry. an example of this is radio-frequency identification (rfid), which allows a product to be tracked by radio frequency.  starting in june 2003, the wal-mart company requested that its top 100 suppliers place rfid tags on pallets and cases that were shipped to stores in dallas, texas.  many retailers such as target, best buy, and albertson\\'s followed suit, and many manufacturers began to implement the technology within their products (read, 2004). rfid technology has the potential to revolutionize the consumer product industry, but also contains monumental obstacles that need to be overcome to realize its full potential.  while rfid promises new and efficient ways to distribute and control products within the consumer packaged goods (cpg) industry, there remain a number of questions that must be resolved before the technology is completely adopted by the industry.  rfid must present an accepted roi formula that proves that it is accepted by all levels in the supply chain.  roi formulas vary by company, but normal business practices call for any capital expenditures to either maintain or improve the company\\'s return on investment goals.  simply stated, corporations are keenly aware of how wall street evaluates their expenditures for any asset, including technology.  usually the higher and faster the return on investment equates to higher stock ratings and the resulting higher stock valuation.  privately held companies might be judged to be worth more in the event they were to be sold.  the issues with rfid are further complicated by the return rate which can vary by market segment; a manufactures roi requirement may be different than a distributors or retailer due to industry standards and competition.  \"best of class\" always tends to set hurdle rates for each segment.  additionally, all levels effective supply chain management technology  3 must decide upon a common and efficient hardware configuration.   the data that is collected and assigned to products must also be managed and defined.  current legacy systems must also be taken into account and the process of implementing the new technology must be defined in a consistent framework.  finally, rfid must create standards and concepts that can be applied throughout the business world including international networks and supply chains (poirier, 2006). this paper will look at the current state of rfid technology in the consumer packaged goods industry.  it will look the benefits and barriers to implementing the technology across the industry.  the paper will conduct a study that will look at a major distributor in the consumer packaged goods industry, the mclane company.  the current distribution model and technology used by the organization will be discussed and analyzed.  fill rates and replenish processes using barcode technology will be discussed to determine if a new technology such as rfid tags would improve fill rates, location, tracking, and efficiency. the study will provide the industry insight into the benefits and obstacles into implementing rfid across a large scale.  listed below are the questions this thesis will address.  research questions \\uf0b7 what is the current distribution model used by the mclane company? \\uf0b7

concept of supply chain management (scm) has been studied for decades.  moving products effectively from production to the end user has been studied and analyzed by manufactures, distributors and retailers, all attempting to improve the process.  the term \"supply chain management\", became popular in the late 1980\\'s within the business world.  is defined as \"the systemic, strategic coordination of the traditional business functions and the tactics across these business functions within a particular company and across businesses within the supply chain, for the purposes of improving the long-term performance of the individual companies and the supply chain as a whole\" (metzer, 2001).   the supply chain is operated by a number of components and organizations.  each component is responsible for different functions, with the end goal of delivering a final product to the consumer effectively and at a low cost.  the companies that participate in the supply chain include producers, distributors, retailers, and the consumer.  producers are typically the manufactures of a product.  they make a product out of raw materials and package the product for consumption.  distributors are organizations that are the middleman between the manufacturer and retailer.  a distributor will receive and store products from a large number of manufacturers and will deliver or replenish the product to retailers depending on the retailers need.  retailers sell products directly to consumers.  retailers will advertise products and promotions to attract consumers to their stores.  consumers are the typically the end user of the product (hugos, 2006). there are a number of factors that drive the supply chain.  these include production, location, inventory, transportation, and information.  production includes the effective supply chain management technology  6 actual manufacturing of a product, quantity produced, and balancing the production capabilities while still maintaining quality. inventory management focuses on two important aspects, customer service and cost control.  inventory management helps decide how much inventory should be stocked during every stage of the supply chain.  inventory can be costly to hold, but must also be readily available, therefore a balance of levels must be made to ensure the most optimum level.  location in supply chain management determines the location of production and inventory.  organizations must ensure that the location of the facilities provide efficient transportation for delivery to retailers and consumers.  transportation involves what method is utilized to move the product through the supply chain (truck, train, aircraft, etc.).  information is another important aspect of supply chain management.  data must be collected and shared to ensure proper management and logistics (hugos, 2006). in order for supply chain management to work effectively, information must be gathered and stored throughout the management chain lifecycle.  when large amounts of products are produced and distributed throughout the supply chain, it is essential that these products can be identified effectively and efficiently.   in order to manage and maintain information and data, products are provided with an identification number or product identification code.  this code can identify a product quickly and efficiently and allows organizations to collect and share data (hugos, 2006). for the past fifteen years the most popular product tracking standard has been the universal product code or upc.  the first bar code was introduced in 1952, by joseph woodland and bernard silver.  the bar code was not used commercially until 1966.  starting in 1970 the first industry standard was introduced. it was called the universal effective supply chain management technology  7 grocery product identification code or ugpic.  three years later, the ugpic became what is now known as upc.  the first product to be used at a retail store occurred on june, 26, 1974, when a 10-pack of wrigley juicy fruit gum was scanned using a hand held scanner at marsch supermarket in troy, ohio.  since its original scanning in 1974 upc bar codes have been used to scan billions of products at retail stores (albert, 2007). the introduction of upc in the retail industry quickly transformed the way the cpg and grocery industry managed their business.  standards were created in upc barcodes and the system grew into a global system called the gs1 system.  the gs1 system is used by millions of companies in over 140 countries (barcodes, 2010). upc product codes are created by a not-for-profit company called uniform code council, or ucc.  the organization develops worldwide standards for identification codes and electronic commerce.  a upc barcode symbol includes a black and white bar code consisting of vertical black bars and white spaces in-between.  in addition to the black and white bar code, numbers are located at the bottom of each bar code symbol.  the distance between the vertical bars and the thickness of the black vertical bars contains the numbers in the barcode.  each barcode contains two black bars that identify the beginning and the end of the bar code (barcodes, 2010). when an organization requests a product to be entered in the upc system, the ucc will issue the manufacturer a specific identification number.  the gs1 company prefix is a unique code that contains a numerical sequence of anywhere from seven to eleven numerical digits which then are licensed to the manufacturer for a single item.  a legal entity gln is also assigned to the manufacturer that identifies legal descriptions and functions (uniform code council, 2010). effective supply chain management technology  8 the use of upc codes actually began in the early 1970\\'s as a technological solution for large supermarkets trying to price goods. supermarkets were spending millions of labor dollars annually, paying workers to work nights affixing adhesive type labels to every \"store keeping unit\" or\" sku\" which they stocked. items that were refrigerated or frozen posed special problems for adhesive labels.  night labor was paid a premium shift differential and there was also a higher percentage of employee turnover; thereby increasing hiring and training costs.  it was made even more difficult, as the pricing of many goods are driven by the constantly changing commodity markets, and also other factors such as; freight costs, labor strikes, weather, manufacturing promotional activity, and competition supermarket profits depend on their ability to quickly raise prices on items that have gone up, thereby creating inventory profit gains. the reverse situation when prices fall also creates the need to maintain competitive pricing to protect market share.  pricing integrity is an important factor for customer retention. sale or promo items also drive price change needs. wednesday became the main newspaper advertising day for supermarkets to run their weekly specials, so all promo items had to be marked down on tuesday night. situations arose where the same product in the same bin had more than one price, or there were numerous incidents where the new price label did not quite cover the old price, triggering the infamous public announcement, \"price check in aisle 3 please\"(grogman, 2009).  supermarkets liked the premise that a unique numerical barcode would be made for every item produced and easily printed on the existing label or exterior packaging.  the upc process, although tedious in start up, quickly gained a loyal following because of the high return on the investment.  like any major technological change it created new effective supply chain management technology  9 challenges, the scanners were expensive and worked well when the upc code was easily displayed, but some items with reflective qualities such as water or clear juices reflected back the scan resulting in a \"no read\" and slowed the checkers. other times the scan bar was unable to read anything, as the enclosed glass screen was dirty, because of wet produce or leaking containers.  training techniques for check-out personal had to be included in the program. other issues that challenged the program were items made overseas that were not participating in the upc program, these vendor partners had to adhere to the standards or be culled from the sku mix.  there were also items that had the upc code but inside the carton there was more than one saleable unit. many times these individual items did not have a upc code, so someone buying one snicker bar, might inadvertently, pay for a box of 36.  these situations also led to overstock issues when supermarkets started using upc codes for replenishment, as sometimes there was confusion between eaches, boxes, and cases (grogman, 2009). the success of upc technology also accelerated the acceptance of the vmi process which was mentioned earlier.  there had been a huge increase in the number of products that were manufactured by one corporation, as well, as high volume sku\\'s, which represented high percentages of daily sales. proctor and gamble, as an example, supplies thousands of items in many categories to a supermarket. it has products in almost every aisle and might control 15% to 20% of the total items stocked.  this type of mega-penetration leads to the mutual need of being \"in-stock\" and also being on the same page when it comes to marketing and advertising. vmi insures that a supermarket chain will have the information to promote certain items at the same time the manufacturer is using a variety of media events to create demand. the price that is charged is always, by effective supply chain management technology  10 law, determined by the retailer. the supermarket or big box store must have a firm written agreement in place which spells out measurable parameters that must be adhered to. main elements include; dollar inventory levels by day, week, and month, and cover holiday and seasonal items. inventory goals must also be negotiated to maximize inventory turn to free up capital from slow moving inventory. the manufacturer also benefits by manufacturing on a \"just in time\" atmosphere which \"frees up\" its capital as well, and allows it to operate more efficiently. shipping parameters must be decided to maximize both parties\\' logistical needs and sometimes enables a retailer to fine or charge back a vendor for failing to perform. finally there needs to be a written description of how and when \"on-going dialogue\" is to take place. a manufacturer always wants more shelf space and more of its sku\\'s displayed, a retailer wants to stock what consumers want and also what produces the largest profit. vmi has evolved into a basic tenant of successful \"major retail players\" (grogman, 2009). while upc has been used in the majority of cpg supply chain management product coding, a new technology called radio frequency identification or rfid has recently began to gain momentum.  the beginnings of rfid can be traced back to world war ii.  the united kingdom applied rfid type devices to identify airplanes returning from a mission.  previously, radar could only detect incoming aircraft, but not the country of origin.  the application for using the technology began advancing in other industries about 30 years later.  the supply chain has been a particularly strong market for rfid and its technology.  in 1974, a group of european organizations came together to develop a standard number system similar to the upc standards that were established in the united states.  the resulting organization became known as european article numbering effective supply chain management technology  11 international or ean.   in 1999, steps were taken to form a global network that would standardize rfid in the supply chain.  the ucc and procter and gamble began funding the auto-id center, which is based at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge massachusetts.  the major goal of the auto id center was to create inexpensive rfid tags that could be used in consumer goods.    the tags would allow a network to collect and share information about products that had a rfid chip installed.  the auto-id center plans to create a network that would become \"an internet of things\": and allow the ability to share and locate items throughout the network.  the auto-id center is comprised of 100 global companies and seven universities from around the world.  the center focuses on creating cost efficient standards, and future proofing the epc network infrastructure. this will allow the industry to grow and support future applications and advancements in technology (poirier & mccollum, 2006). the interest in rfid continued to develop in the cpg industry, wal-mart in 2003 announced new mandates for rfid implementations.  wal-mart required that its top 100 suppliers must apply rfid labels to all of its shipments.  early adopters of rfid found it difficult to implement the system in their current legacy and supply chain management systems.  many manufacturers implemented manual processes which made it difficult to realize a fair return on investment (duvall, 2007). rfid operations and functions rfid provides a tagging system that allows an object to be tracked, located, and identified using wireless communication.  information regarding a product or item is contained in small chips that are attached to a pallet, a shipping container, or the item itself.  the information contained on the chip can be received by an rfid reader and effective supply chain management technology  12 information can be decoded and stored on servers.  the information is sent through a radio frequency and the frequency contains the products\\' electronic product code, or epc.  information including the epc is saved on the rfid chip; the chip has a miniature antenna.  a numbering system identifies all items as unique.  when a reader scans a rfid chip, the chip will return the items epc. information stored on the chip includes the code header, the epc manager number, the object class, and the serial number.  the header contains the information regarding the type of epc including the length and type.  the epc manager number maintains and identifies the company or entity.  the object class shows the class of the item.  the object class is a similar practice to the sku.  finally, the serial number identifies the instance of the object class (poirier, 2006). an entire rfid system consists of an rfid tag, an antenna, a rfid reader, application software, and middleware.  the rfid tag can be either a read-only tag or a read/write tag.  the tag broadcasts the information about the item to a reader that is requesting the item.  the antenna transmits and receives data through radio frequency.  readers send a signal to the rfid tag and receive a response.  the reader receives commands from the application software.  in addition, the reader can provide the rfid chip with power when the rfid tag is a passive tag.  the application software can be programmed to accommodate the functions of the user.  the middleware is used between the hardware and application software (poirer, 2006).  rfid chips can be active or passive.  passive chips have no internal power supply and rely on the rfid reader to provide a small amount of power to active the chip.  passive tags are cheaper and smaller because of the lack of an internal power supply.  active chips contain an internal power source which allows the chip to transmit a effective supply chain management technology  13 stronger data signal over long ranges.  the chip can also contain a larger internal memory.  the internal memory and internal power source allows the tag to store data that is sent from the receiver.  active tags are larger than passive tags, but they are more powerful and have the ability to write data, making the active tags more functional (myerson, 2007). while there are no current universal standards in rfid technology, there has been a considerable amount of work done to develop standards for different applications.  an organization called the international organization for standardizing or iso created standards for tracking animals called iso 11784.  additionally, the iso has created standards for payment systems and smart cards.  the auto-id center has been trying to create low-cost rfid tags for supply chain management and cpg\\'s.  the technology they began using was ultra-high frequency band or uhf.  the auto id center also developed a protocol and licensed it to the epcgobal.  the protocol is made royalty-free for manufacturers and users.  the uhf protocol was originally designed to communicate with different classes as technology advanced.  class 1 is a passive rfid tag that is read only.  class 2 is a passive tag system that has 6kb of read and writes memory.  class 3 is a semi-passive tag with a built in battery for increased readability.  class 4 is an active tag that has a built in battery and additionally transmits to a signal.  class 5 is also an active tag that can only communicate with class 5 tags and devices.  auto-id gave its class 0 and class 1 protocol to the epcglobal and the epcglobal approved class 0 and class 1 as epc standards (myerson, 2007). class 0 and class 1 rifd both possess downsides.  they do not work with one another and are also incompatible with the iso standards.   both classes also operate effective supply chain management technology  14 using two different frequencies, one that is used to send and another to receive.  this issue has caused problems in some countries where regulations prohibited their use.  a new protocol was introduced in 2004 that included a second generation of rfid tags.  the tags were developed to work within iso standards, but were not compatible with previous generation 1 and 2 classes (myerson, 2007). rfid in consumer packaged goods using rfid in the cpg industry is a relatively new concept.  the idea took a large leap when wal-mart, the world\\'s largest retailer, began to mandate that the supplier begin to use rfid and electronic product codes to track pallets and cases.  wal-mart met with its top 100 suppliers and introduced the concept of rfid and requested that suppliers begin using the technology for distribution to its stores.  their rfid strategy was announced in 2003, and top suppliers were mandated to tag all pallets by 2005. the goal included adding the next 100 suppliers to the mandate every year.  wal-mart believed that a transition to rfid would improve efficiencies in logistics, improve out-of-stocks, and improve sales (supply chain digest, 2009).  although wal-mart gained support from some suppliers such as proctor and gamble and unilever, many suppliers have been slow in achieving implementation.  seven years after wal-mart\\'s initial mandate, only 600 of their 60,000 suppliers have been able to adapt to the changes.  the roi has been debated among suppliers. an average low cost rfid tag costs 10-15 cents. compared to the standard bar code, this is relatively high, particularly among item level tagging. this makes it difficult for suppliers to invest.  wal-mart is not the only retailer to have difficulty implementing an rfid strategy.  retailers such as albertsons, best buy and target have all tried test pilots using effective supply chain management technology  15 their own rfid programs, but have scaled back implementation because of high costs and other difficulties, similar to what wal-mart experienced (duvall, 2007). in 2007, wal-mart scaled back its implementation of rfid.  instead of having all pallets tagged with rfid, they focused on shipments to sam\\'s club (wal-mart\\'s wholesale chain). they also focused on promotional displays and products in wal-mart retail stores, and began to test the impact of the technology in improving category management in some departments (supply chain digest, 2009).  wal-mart is still pushing forward with its mandate for suppliers to comply with its rfid system.  beginning in january of 2008, wal-mart charged suppliers with a $2.00 fee for every pallet that was not tagged with an rfid tag shipped to sams club (weier, 2008). the charge covered the cost that wal-mart had to pay in order for the company to affix a tag.  additionally, wal-mart announced plans to implement pallet level tagging in 17 distribution centers by 2008, case and mix pallet tagging by 2009, and selling-unit tagging in all distribution centers by october 2010 (duvall, 2007). benefits of rfid in consumer packaged goods rfid technology has a number of benefits over the current barcode system which is currently used in the cpg industry.  rfid technology has benefits that include reduced warehouse and distribution costs, reduced point of sale costs, increased inventory accuracy, reduced theft, and reduction in out of stock items at retail.  rfid also provides the benefits of allowing a product or item to be tracked in a real time basis as it progresses through the supply chain.  items can be tracked using an rfid reader, which eliminates the need to physically scan an item with a handheld scanner.  a rfid can also scan multiple items at the same time, eliminating the need for a barcode scanner that effective supply chain management technology  16 scans items individually.  rfid tags can also hold and store much more information than a traditional barcode system.  some rfid tags can read and write data allowing information to be recorded, tracked, and changed through the supply chain (poirier, 2006). according to a survey by aberdeen group in 2007 the top objectives of rfid in manufacturing included asset tracking, production efficiency, supply chain visibility, raw materials management, mandate compliance, and finished goods inventory control (zebra, 2007). in relation to retail stores, rfid technology can greatly reduce out of stock items and provide better visibility of products within the store.  out of stock items are still major factors in the loss of sales at store level. ensuring that an item is in stock and available to a retailers\\' customer is extremely important to many organizations.  for example wal-mart currently has its store divided into multiple departments with each managed by a department manager or zone manager.  every day, wal-mart protocol requires their manager to scan out of stock item slots with handheld computers, called telxons.  the telxon will inform the manager if the item is really in stock in the backroom.  if it is, the manager will add the item to the \"pick-list\".  the pick-list will then be used to notify a backroom inventory specialist to select the item and place it in the sales slot as soon as possible.  if the item is not in the located in the backroom, the handheld unit will tell the employee that the inventory is not located within the store. the device will inform the employee that the product is in transit, or needs to be ordered from the distribution center.   effective supply chain management technology  17 this telxon system provides an adequate way to measure and adjust quantities, but there are some problems within the system.  on-hand inventory can be inaccurate caused by issues such as; theft or \"mis-ships\" (items received are mislabeled or the received quantity was inaccurate).  therefore the inventory system shows available product that is not really in the store.  this issue becomes more complicated as the reenlistment process is reordering based on a wrong inventory level.   another common problem is when a product is displayed in multiple departments or checkout registers.  when an item has multiple placements, an item might be out of stock in some locations, but not in others.  an example would be a frontend checkout display in a mass retailer.  a retail store might have a plan-o-gram which instructs the store to display the same items on ever checkout station.  if these items are located on regularly open registers, they will quickly run out of stock.  these same items that are displayed on seldom open checkout registers will carry excess inventory.  many systems such as wal-mart use a replenishment program based on average sales of items, insuring that inventory levels are replenished without having a large amount of back-stock inventory.  when a high traffic register is used, the inventory is depleted and not automatically restocked.  therefore these systems using average sales or point of sales are not replenished correctly.  these issues can lead to an on-going problem, creating mainly out of stocks, unless the system is corrected manually by a store employee. accurate forecasting and customer specific marketing is another benefit of rfid.  according to a study by auto id, using the technology can improve demand planning forecast accuracy by 10-20%.  planning and forecasting are important to every organization because they reduce out of stocks, lower the risk of unsalable items, reduce effective supply chain management technology  18 excess inventory levels, and improve efficiencies in distribution and other related costs   (smith, 2002). the reduction of inventory costs for the manufacturers from rfid can provide enormous savings both in \"inventory on-hand\" as well as reduced \"finished inventory\". it is exciting to think that finished goods can be sent directly to wholesalers or in some case to the retailers themselves. this process would eliminate the need for regional storage warehouses or mixing warehouses for companies who produce certain products in select plants and them merge or mix them in consolidated warehouse for re-shipment to usually the distributor. these freight and storage savings can be passed on to the consumer in the way of lower pricing which will increase sales. another advantage of rfid technology for the retailer is that the chip can identify where the item was actually purchased, thereby helping them control receiving returns from customers who purchased the product from another retailer. returned goods cause especially large and costly problems for big box stores like wal-mart, sam\\'s, costco, etc as they have liberal return policies.  the labor savings derived from rfid, does not just mean fewer checkers and support personnel but it will increase employees productivity. all retailers want to create a better, faster, and more enjoyable shopping experience to attract and maintain customers.   rfid technology will provide the \"perfect order\" from the distributor or from the retailers own distribution centers. currently, there are large costs associated with the issuance of credits and the resulting management of account payables, due to mis-selects, overages and shortages. mclane estimates that every credit that is written costs over $25 in labor to process (mclane, 2009). these costs can be greatly reduced or eliminated with a rfid system for all parties in the supply chain.   effective supply chain management technology  19 unsaleable items are those that are at the wrong place, or at the wrong time, or appear damaged. an example of the latter would include; displaying snow shovels in the middle of the summer, or still having christmas candy on the shelves in february.  these types of errors bloat the inventory in terms of dollars, take up valuable space to sell fresh or current inventory, and finally necessitates the need to discount these items. selling old or out of season inventory items also implants the idea in the shoppers mind that the store has stale product.  in a study by the unsaleable committee, and organization made of producers and retailers, the grocery channel unsaleables were at a 1.27% of sales, which is nearly 5 billions dollars in lost sales (smith, 2002). invoice accuracy is also an issue that affects accurate forecasting; what is listed as being received must be what is truly received.  products with short shelf life or have expiration codes need to be accurately forecasted to reduce waste.  inaccurate data and human error can lead to further inaccurate forecasting with the final results as either over/under supply.  there are also hidden costs associated with returns and credits (smith, 2002). as stated previously, out of stocks within the retail store is very costly to business.  according to a report by the gma it is estimated on average that 8% are not in stock in an average supermarket.  the study noted that promotional items or advertised products were out of stock nearly 20% of the time.  having out of stock items not only means lost sales, but also can lead to customer dissatisfaction, and maybe encourage the shopper to go elsewhere.  according to a research paper completed by accenture for supermarket trade, potential for lost sales of 3% per year equals nearly $12 billion dollars in lost sales revenue (smith, 2002). effective supply chain management technology  20 currently many cpg companies gain forecasting knowledge by analyzing data from companies such as a.c. nielson, information resources, inc. or iri, and organizational databases such as wal-mart\\'s retail link.  many times companies will invest in other point of sale information and data made available from distributors and wholesalers.  data from resources such as a.c nielson and iri are typically out-of-date and based on estimates and mathematical equations.  information from organizational databases such as wal-mart retail link can be valuable, but contains a relatively narrow view as it is based on one company.   furthermore, information gathered from retail link may not explain why sales data changes so radically week to week.  variables such as weather, promos, and inventory levels are not included in the retail link data (smith, 2002). rfid will provide additional communication and data sharing throughout the supply chain.  rfid will also allow product to be tracked in real time and throughout the sales process.  better inventory data in warehouses means higher accuracy will be communicated to manufacturers and retailers.  according to auto id they predict that forecasting estimates can improve by 10-30% by implementing rfid technology.  additionally, auto id predicts that manufacturers can see a 5-30% reduction in inventory levels, 2-13% reduction in warehouse and transportation costs, 1-5% in increased sales, and 10-50% reduction in lead times.  they also predict that retailers can improve shelf rate sales movement in retailers by 5-30%, 5-10% lower inventory levels, and 2-10% in increased overall retail sales (smith, 2002). with an rfid based inventory, system retailers have a stronger knowledge exchange and better visibility of all products within their store. a fully operational rfid effective supply chain management technology  21 system, where every item has a rfid tag, the retailer would have accurate knowledge of all inventories and where the inventory is actually located in the store.  from the time the product arrives at the store, to the moment the item is purchased by the consumer; the store could be able to monitor the inventory level and the inventory location. additionally, the accurate inventory will cause the correct replenishment order to be placed or transmitted. the rfid system will reduce human error and eliminate current system errors.   another benefit of rfid is active management.  active management allows for organizations not only to see the location of their product, but also the environment where it is stored.  for example, an organization that manufactures a product that is temperature sensitive such as yogurt could monitor and record the temperatures throughout the supply chain.  the organization would not only know that the product may be damaged or unsalable, but also be able to alert the distributor or warehouse and inform them of the problem or issue before the product is received and shipped to the retailer (agarwal, 2001). theft and security is another major advantage of rfid.  barcode and upc technology do not offer protection from theft.  security tags are often applied to high ticket items such as electronics, but that can be costly and time consuming.  rfid tags can offer additional security throughout the products distribution and retail life.  rfid readers can warn stores and management when products are accidently or deliberately being taken from the store.  organizations will be able to better control shrinkage by understanding the major causes on a real time basis (agarwal, 2001). effective supply chain management technology  22 products with short shelf life or with expiration codes, for example milk or eggs, can be monitored to ensure they are rotated and sold before expiration.  in many cases retailers fail to rotate their inventory, placing replenished items in front of older products.  this can be costly to the retailer in lost sales due to expiration dates.  additionally, customers can become frustrated when they arrive home and notice that the product they purchased is expired or near expiration.  this can impact customer loyalty and discourage repeat business. rfid can identify products based on their expiration data and ensure the product is properly rotated. out of date product can then be quickly removed from shelf (agarwal, 2001). product recalls and other mandates create issues for retailers, suppliers, and manufacturers. often times, rather than pulling the batch number of a certain product, the entire product line is pulled because it is difficult or impossible to trace the specific product or batch.  for example, in december of 2009, johnson and johnson announced a recall of tylenol arthritis pain tablets.  it was reported that this product had an unusual odor and there were reports of consumers becoming ill.  the lack of specific information caused the recall to include many tylenol pain relievers and also motrin, rolaids, and benadryl which are also manufactured at the same plants.  the total amount of product recalled included more than 54 million bottles.  some of the products were found to contain a chemical called 2, 4, 6-tribomaonisole, it is now known that the odor was traced to a chemical used to treat wooden pallets that johnson and johnson used to transport these items in only a few of their distributors (berman, 2010).   recalls costs retailers and manufacturers millions of dollars in lost sales and potentially destroy an entire brand or company.  technology found in rfid can streamline the of recall process.  rfid effective supply chain management technology  23 products can be programmed to contain much greater data on each chip enabling the company to quickly zero in on a specific product rather than using the current \"shotgun\" process. rfid technology has the potential to save the entire supply chain substantial amounts in labor costs. labor costs are a significant expense in the total supply chain, contributing to approximately 30% of overall supply chain costs (chappell, 2002).  reducing this cost can provide a large cost savings throughout the industry.  many current systems use a process of manually scanning product and location barcodes.  for example, the current receiving and check-in process requires that an item or case barcode must be manually scanned and checked-in.  items are compared to a receiving checklist and labels are printed.  this process can be time consuming and is prone to human error.  organizations can reduce labor costs by implementing an rfid system where labor is not required to manually scan barcodes.  cases and items that are brought into the distribution center will immediately be read, inventory amounts automatically adjusted, and the storage location of the items recorded.  items are quickly identified and inaccuracies can quickly be resolved.   when the items are moved to a new location within the warehouse, the rfid tag will automatically display its new location.  this will eliminate the need for an employee to scan the product and the location and eliminates the need to verify its location (palmer, 2004).  when an order is filled, employees can select items and the system will automatically adjust inventory levels and verify the accuracy of the order.  when shipping, items can be loaded directly on the outbound trailer or rail car and shipped.  in automated environments, the speed in which conveyers operate will increase because there is no need for lasers to scan the product\\'s barcode.  in effective supply chain management technology  24 a study by accenture they estimated that using rfid could reduce labor costs by between 5 and 40 percent (chappell, 2002).  another advantage of rfid can be found at the retail store\\'s checkout station. currently a typical shopping experience involves customers selecting products throughout the store and putting the items in baskets or carts.  when the customer completes their shopping, they proceed to the checkout counter.   items are taken out of the shopping cart and placed on a conveyor belt; a cashier will then manually scan items with a barcode laser scanner, which is typically located on the bottom of the register.  the cashier will also have a handheld scanner that will be used to scan hard to reach barcodes on larger items.  this process can be cumbersome and slow and can lead to frustration.  products with damaged barcodes or products, such as water, can interfere with the scanner, forcing the cashier to manually enter the products upc number into the cash register.  this procedure can holdup the checkout process and cause delays for all customers.  with an rfid checkout system, all items can be read without even taking the product out of the cart.  when a consumer walks through a tunnel reader with their shopping cart, all items in the cart are automatically scanned by the rfid reader.  this method can greatly improve the checkout process by reducing the time a customer waits and will improve the overall customer satisfaction rate.  additionally, the process can reduce the amount of labor needed by the retailer to operate checkouts and increase the accuracy of the order.  this can save the retailer meaningful labor costs and will increase inventory turns due to improved accuracy.  improved marketing is another advantage of an rfid system.  customer shopping habits can be tracked while they are in the store.  retailers can benefit from this effective supply chain management technology  25 knowledge by updating their plan o grams so that related or complimentary items are displayed in areas and shelf locations that will stimulate increased customer purchases (sharpels, 2005).  rfid also allows greater sales tracking data that can be used to inform retailers of what is being sold by zip code, enabling stores to stock what the consumers want to buy, rather than using regional or national plan-o-grams.  this increased data accuracy can also stimulate mark-downs on product before short dating or out of date occurs. real time data also enables the manufacturer and retailer to plan \"linked\" promotional activity whereby a well priced popular item is sold along with a lesser known product to stimulate the weaker items sales growth, i.e.: hair conditioner linked with shampoo.  real time data also gives the retailer to quickly assess whether their current item placement, pricing, or promotional activity needs to be changed.    obstacles of rfid in consumer packaged goods while rfid technology can benefit the consumer packaged goods industry, it faces a number of challenges and constraints that has slowed the adoption by retailers, manufacturers, and distributors.  these factors include the high costs of the silicon chips themselves, as well the hardware and software needed to operate systemically with all types of chips, including \"smart chips\".  in addition, there are a multitude of other challenges that have slowed the implementation across the cpg industry.   the high price of the rfid chip has historically been the largest obstacle in the adoption of rfid in the cpg industry. manufacturers, retailers, and distributors have been hesitant to adopt rfid technology because it costs so much more than traditional barcodes and upc systems.  it is a gigantic task for an industry to totally change how they do business. retailers are beginning to recognize some of the benefits that an rfid effective supply chain management technology  26 system can have on their bottom line.  it reduces out-of-stock and shrinkage, and provides a better method for managing inventory and improves forecasting.  manufacturers and distributors are also hesitant to adopt the technology; they too need to be convinced of the benefits for them, not just the retailer.   typically an rfid passive tags cost around $0.15 - $1.00 per tag in the united states.  prices are subject to cost variations due to the technology and complexity depending on the type of the tag (poirier, 2006).  these high costs makes it virtually impossible for a manufacturer of smaller cpg\\'s to implement the technology.  for example the cost of a 3 pack of trident white spearmint gum is $1.41.  retailers in the cpg industry usually look for a profit margin of around 30%.  therefore the retail price of the 3 pack of gum would be 1.98, with a $0.57 profit to the store.  if a rfid tag were to be applied to every pack of gum, the cost of $0.20 would have large effects on the profit margin within the store.  the retail store would have to raise their prices to the consumer or the manufacturer would have to greatly lower or eliminate the profit of every item sold (cadbury profit margin, 2010). while rfid tags are not currently implemented on every individual product, they are beginning to be used in case and pallet level tagging.  this method works for tracking and validates delivery, and also allows the ability to track and monitor the movement in the supply chain.  still it fails to derive the true benefits of having a total rfid tag system for inventory, security, and forecasting.  item level tagging would have to be implemented to realize the benefits of unit level handling.   recently auto-id has made advancements to lower the cost of rfid tags.  these tags are much less complex, and simply store the electronic product code of the product.  effective supply chain management technology  27 these chips are much smaller and much cheaper.    auto-id believes that they can soon begin to manufacture passive rfid chips for as little as $.05 (swamy, 2006). the cost of individual tags is not the only barrier to implementation; there are additional costs to the supply chain.  these costs involve applying the tags to the products, costs related to installing rfid tag readers in warehouses and manufacturing plants, costs associated with integration into legacy systems, cost in training employees and organization, and the cost of software and hardware solutions (myerson, 2006). concerns have been concerning the ability of rfid to accurately read certain products.  products such as water, metal, and other materials have caused delays and inaccuracies because of their inference with radio signals.  these products need special consideration when applying a tag because their material limits the read ranges.  the following table shows the read ranges of 915 mhz signals in feet (myerson, 2006).  table 1: read ranges of materials    plastic  metal, direct contact  metal, .06\" stand-off  glass  cardboard  free space  plywood  container insert 4.5 .5 .5 8 3.5 3.5 6 container tag 9.5 .25 .75 5 9 13 8 intelligent id

(myerson. 2006) effective supply chain management technology  28  global acceptance of a standard is another concern among the industry.  although there have been efforts made to create standards for rfid and radio frequency there has yet to be a complete accepted standard.  when dealing with a global distribution system, organizations must consider frequencies and standards throughout the world.  organizations are hesitant to invest large quantities of capital to promote a new technology when the current system of bar-coding is acceptable and already implemented. privacy is another major concern to the use of rfid technology in the cpg industry.  consumers and end users of a product that has been tagged with an rfid chip may be unaware of the extent technology and its many uses.  when gillette began piloting its test program within wal-mart, they enabled a security measure that would alert store personnel not only when restocking was needed, but also when high quantities of products had been removed that could possibly be the result of shoplifting.  the consumer advocacy group consumer against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering, also referred to as caspian, launched a campaign to alert consumer and advised to boycott gillette products.  many consumers then became aware of the potential privacy violations (poirier, 2006).  some states began looking at laws to protect consumers.       the actual implementation of a new technology into the industry is another obstacle in the adoption of rfid. the initial investment of installing hardware and software will be a significant cost to all members of the supply chain.  costs would include rfid readers, transponders, tags, and the systems and software to operate the effective supply chain management technology  29 technology. training and support services must also be developed and maintained.   additionally, software must be developed to insure that information gathered from the new system is gathered and stored properly so the information can be retrieved and used for business planning.   the amount of data that an rfid system will collect and store will demand much greater storage capacity than the current legacy systems.  organizations must consider the amount of data that the new system will collect and store and design software to manage the information (sharpels, 2005).    implementing the new system will also require the industry to maintain the new system with legacy systems.  while an organization moves to a new rfid supply chain system, there will be redundancies with their existing barcode system.  this will require the organization to maintain two separate systems that require maintenance for a significant period of time.  in addition, the two systems will require two separate operating systems for data collecting and software processes.  eventually, the new system will become the only system used, but the cost of maintaining an existing system while implementing a new system can be costly and difficult to maintain.          effective supply chain management technology  30 chapter 3 – methodology  in order to better understand the benefits and obstacles of rfid, this paper will conduct a study of the mclane company.  the mclane company is a major distributor in  the consumer packaged goods industry, and conducts business with some of the largest manufactures and retailers in the world.  the current distribution model and technology used by the organization will be discussed and analyzed.  fill rates and replenish processes using barcode technology will be discussed to determine if a new technology such as rfid tags would improve fill rates, location, tracking, and efficiency. the mclane company was chosen because of their distribution depth pertaining to product mix and customer base.  they allowed full access to their colorado distribution facility.  they also allowed interviews to be conducted with executives in their logistics, information technology, and operational groups located in their corporate offices in temple, texas.  the only request which they made was the opportunity to review the thesis prior to submittal and also to use the study internally for focus groups assigned to rfid planning.     the case study was conducted by interviewing a number of mclane company employees and executive personnel over a 3 month period.  information from each department was analyzed to gain a broad overview of the company and its practices. detailed information, regarding mclane\\'s current distribution practices, was recorded and formatted.  time was physically spent within one of mclane\\'s warehouses located in longmont, co.  operations and practices within the warehouse were recorded and analyzed.  in addition, data regarding current fill rates, efficiencies, and practices were captured.  information was gathered from mclane\\'s \"superior execution measurements\" effective supply chain management technology  31 which measures components of the business both internally and externally.  data such as timely delivery, order quality, and teammate productivity was gathered and analyzed.  some of the proprietary information gathered from the mclane company, particularly point of sale data from third parties, could not be directly referenced or included in this paper. the final section of the case study will include the recommendation for implementing a rfid system within the mclane company.  benefits and constraints of implementing a new rfid system will be analyzed.  finally, a business strategy for implementing an rfid system will be recommended.                  effective supply chain management technology  32 chapter 4 – project analysis and results in order to understand the magnitude of implementing the new rfid system, it is beneficial to look at the distribution methods of a large wholesaler.  one such company is the mclane company of temple, texas.  the mclane company is a supply chain company that provides grocery and foodservice distribution to convenience stores, big box stores, restaurant chains, and drug stores.  they are a $34 billion dollar organization with over 15,000 employees making it one of the largest distributors of cpg in the united states (kimborough, 2009). mclane company operates 41 mega-distribution centers in the united states, one of which is located longmont colorado. weekly service is provided to nearly every zip code in the lower 48 states, and weekly service is available to both hawaii and alaska via barge delivery.  densely populated areas receive daily service when needed.  the customer base is divided into four basic groups of customers: convenience stores, big box retailers, military, and finally foodservice.  the grocery division handles the first three categories and the foodservice handles only national or large regional quick serve restaurant chains.  the current annual volume is reported to be approximately $34 billion and the company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the berkshire hathaway corporation (kimborough, 2009). the grocery division services more than 30,000 convenience stores with virtually everything that they stock, with the exception of alcohol and brand name soft drinks.  these are distributed directly by the individual manufacturers. the items they distribute include cigarettes, and other tobacco products, confections, dry groceries, refrigerated goods, frozen goods, paper products, janitorial supplies, and miscellaneous effective supply chain management technology  33 goods. the military business is similar with a heavier emphasis on cigarettes and tobacco products. the big box stores usually do their own distribution of the majority of their own products but rely on mclane to supplement their distribution when it is more cost effective.   mclane operates over three thousand multi-temperature semi trucks, which distribute; dry grocery, fresh, frozen, and dairy products.  many of mclane\\'s customers that self distribute use only non-refrigerated trailers, so mclane saves them millions of dollars in capital that it would cost to convert to multi-temperature equipment (kimborough, 2009). mclane purchases all goods centrally, with the top hundred vendors supplying vmi (vendor managed inventory) services, a central purchasing department takes the remaining items and divides them into industry recognized categories and buys and manages these accordingly.  sophisticated buying formulas are used for replacement, with high emphasis on providing 99% fill rates on all categories except for cigarettes and tobacco which mclane guarantees 100% fill rates. many of the individual mclane customer contracts contain clauses that guarantee these high fill rates and some have penalties notated if mclane fails to provide them. these high fill rate guarantees also place enormous internal emphasis on inventory levels, as inventory turn becomes critical to mclane\\'s profitability (kimborough, 2009). most goods are delivered to mclane by truck in full truck quantities, smaller vendors or specialty goods are received in ltl quantities. mclane backhauls approximately 40% of all the goods it sells and receives goods 7 days per week in all of its facilities. currently mclane stocks approximately 18,000 skus or items and sells goods in full case, break pack, or individual quantities. items that are less than full case effective supply chain management technology  34 receive an additional mark-up. mclane uses a sophisticated receiving process wherein all goods are scanned by smart handheld devices and are given a license plate or adhesive label which is placed of every skid, identifying the manufacturer, date received, item upc code, also a mclane code. this code can be scanned to guarantee that all goods, including imported goods are properly identified and traceable for recall/accounting reasons. all perishable products are probed to insure that proper temperature was maintained during the shipping process.  finally the license plate tells the forklift driver where to place the goods for easy retrieval for replenishment, but also places the higher moving items in locations that are the closest to the actual selection area (grogman, 2009). figure 1: mclane license plate example effective supply chain management technology  35  (jones t. mclane, 1998) smart handhelds are used by drivers when delivering product.  the system is intended to assist drivers in making more efficient and accurate deliveries.  it provides a method for drivers to verify delivery items quickly, handle credits, manage high value items, and record store deposits.  the smart handheld can used to scan mclane barcodes effective supply chain management technology  36 or upc.  products can be scanned by section, by container or case, or by individual item  (grogman, 2009). the system works by downloading load-specific billing and sales information into the delivery device.  the devices are then matched to the correct driver teams by dispatchers.  information such as container count by section, total number of full cases, and number of cigarettes for the driver to match against are provided.  the driver will then scan all items to verify the delivery of the product.  the driver will scan return credits and manually enter deposit counts.  the delivery report is printed and signed and the driver returns to the division for end day reports (grogman, 2009). the put-away process is accomplished using radio controlled data that is transmitted from the receiving data to dashboard mounted radio receivers on the forklifts; it instructs the operator where to put the product but also gives the process a put away priority in the event that the product is needed in a pick location quickly. the inbound data also automatically updates the available inventory which enables a real time perpetual inventory system (grogman, 2009). the next step is the receiving of the actual customer orders, which are received and held in an order collection data bucket and released based on a predetermined order delivery date and exact truck delivery time.  these orders are placed either directly in mass edi download communication (usually used by large national companies with their own mainframe support) or with smart handhelds,  wherein the customer uses the device to count their existing inventory and then reorders based on a standing inventory basis, or perhaps a more advanced customized approach using historical data that the shh provides.  mclane even has the ability to provide special shh software for a weekly fee effective supply chain management technology  37 which enables customers to order automatically in case of power outages or other related ordering problems. even more advanced software is available for a customer that adheres to a manufacturers program.  the marketing programs might require a constant in-stock or brand depth availability program that would mean large rebates if the retailer met the programs contract (lyon, 2010). smart handhelds is a device system that mclane provides to customers.  it provides an easy and efficient way for the retailer to view items and displays, as well as placing and uploading orders.  in addition, the device allows the retailer to download up to date information and receive messages and communication for mclane.  the device allows the retailer to scan upc barcodes; items can also be searched through item number and description.  the system will provide a purposed order based on order history at the department and at item level.  the handheld system helps improve order input quality, reduces order entry confusion, improves data accuracy, and improves the forecast based on item movement (lyon, 2010) below is a diagram overview of the mclane smart handheld ordering process flow. figure 2: system

category including newly authorized and distribution only categoriesupload order to mclane via dial up connectionreceive order confirmation number on unitorder received and processed by mclane once the orders are received either through mass edi transmissions or shh transmissions, they are automatically sorted by the mainframe order processing system which assigns each individual order a specific number.  this determines in what sequence the orders will be selected, loaded, and dispatched.  every customer has a predetermined delivery day and time which they selected.  the next major step is the actual printing of the invoices and the selection labels which will be the guide for the warehouse staff to pick the right item.  an average customer orders items which are in actually stored in seven different departments; dry full case, frozen full case, single sell, frozen/refrigerated single cell, cigarettes, and candy repack, . therefore the selection labels are printed by effective supply chain management technology  39 department and sent out for selection. these labels are coded with a myriad of data but the most important are: order number, load number, mclane item number, and pick location.  each selector works in a predetermined work area that might encompass anywhere from 15 to 100 feet. the selector has a glove like scanner affixed to one of their hands which has the bar code scanner on the index finger.  the selector picks up a sheet of labels, scans the main order code with his finger and a light will go in the specific bin of where the item to be selected is with an illuminated number indicating the number of items to be picked. the selector picks the correct number and turns out the light, the tote which contains the product then is placed on the conveyor and moves to the next zone where the process is repeated. finally the tote or case has traveled thru the entire department and is then sealed and sent to the high speed sortation conveyors which merge all products from all departments. the merge operator then asks for each order to be released and high speed push roads send the right product in the right order down conveyors which actually go right into a truck trailer. loaders are at the bottom of the conveyors and rescan each product to validate that it is the correct item going to the correct customer on the correct load.  the scan data also allows every selector to be tracked in terms of number of pieces selected by hour, same for the loaders, and in the event there is an error, the mis-selected can be traced back to the person who made the error (lyon, 2010). the truck is loaded and is dispatched at the proper time; orders are guaranteed to arrive within a two hour window, so customers can staff their receiving departments accordingly. all trucks are equipped with gps scanning antennae so a truck is constantly \"pinged\" to make sure that it is running on time and on the proper route. this same data effective supply chain management technology  40 can be accessed by the customer via the internet to find out where their truck is located exactly.  when the delivery is made, the drivers scan the cases and totes as they are placed in the customer\\'s store. if there is a missing or damaged case or item, the driver can issue an electronic credit immediately.  the current standard which mclane has set for order error is .20% or 99.8% accuracy (lyon, 2010). transitioning to rfid while the current system is extremely efficient, mclane is always open to new and better technology.  they aim to be on the forefront of the latest innovations.  they want to not only stay competitive, but to stay ahead of their competitors by providing the best and most accurate service.  they are always ready to adapt to change if it leads to better costumer service.  the size and volume of an organization such as mclane makes it difficult to implement even a small system change, much less a total overhaul in its core distribution model.   implementing an rfid system must be done by developing a business strategy that is well documented and defined.  first the benefits of the new system must be communicated and discussed with business partners and customers.  the system must be validated to ensure that customers understand how the system works and how it affects their business.  second the system must be rolled out in select waves and pilot programs.  customers that are interested in implementing and testing the new system should be the first to run pilot tests.  the services and functions of the new system must be given a standard or goals and then method developed to ensure that these functions and objectives are met.  finally, documentation and data collection must be done to measure effective supply chain management technology  41 the costs associated with the program.  sales and performance standards must be carefully analyzed and compared to previous results to obtain a benchmark.   it is the belief of mclane that a rfid system could increase their productivity in all areas. items could be received quicker and placed in the proper bins with fewer errors. the same is true for production selection speed and finally delivery order rates. perfect orders would be possible, and perfect orders mean high customer satisfaction. if one places a dollar value of running at a 99.8% accuracy rate, then the dollar impact from items that are either over, short or damaged equal over $60 million when the net sales are $30 billion per year. the conversion to the use of rfid tags has started, but like any other enormous project faces many challenges. not all manufacturers have the capital to invest in the equipment to affix the chip to their individual products. other major issues are created when the usa continues to import goods from third world countries to save on product costs and sell at the lowest prices. lower costs sometimes mean lesser adherence to our identification specifications.  what are the hidden distribution costs associated with non-rfid labeled products? the solution lies in several types of approaches. the first is one in which a separate third party company installs and operates the rfid equipment at the manufacturing site on a fee basis. the manufacturer would not have to make major capital investments and could pass along the costs to the consumer, or by maintaining their prices by recouping the costs by better managing the entire manufacturing process. better data will both reduce raw or finished goods and more accurate sales data will aid them in producing inventory of what is selling.   effective supply chain management technology  42 another solution is for distributors, such as mclane to provide the rfid chip for a fee, charging back the cost to the manufacturers. mclane could affix to every case or individual item a customized rfid chip which would be produced from blank chips. this process would replace what mclane is currently doing with their own label process but would require major capital investments in all their centers to use chips versus labels.                      effective supply chain management technology  43 chapter 5 - conclusion  rfid technology has an important future role in the supply chain network.  this paper has focused on consumer packaged goods, but similar savings, accuracy, and speed are applicable to numerous other classes of trade. any new system or technology requires capital, time, and planning to proceed. however the first real first step is to expose the merits of rfid technology to every segment of the supply chain, including the consumer. this paper exposes and explores the details and benefits of this new technology, but in order to succeed, the term rfid must become a household word.  a strong recommendation is that a joint committee should be formed by the companies who would most benefit from its implementation;   silicon chip manufacturers, hardware manufactures, software development firms, etc.  their first order of business is to fund presentation and media materials that will educate and establish the benefits of this revolutionary new technology.  all forms of media have to be controlled to deliver a consistent message.  keeping \"consistent\" as the main component, custom detailed versions have to be developed for every step in the supply management chain.  the type of detail and benefits will be different for the manufactures, distributors, transporters, importers, retailers (national and independent), and finally the consumer. wal-mart has already made progress in advancing the technology, which should give them a head start.  distributors, such as mclane, with existing automated platforms will also have an advantage over those employing manual techniques. this same advantage applies to previously mentioned manufactures, such as proctor& gamble, who are currently working with wal-mart by applying rfid chips to their top selling items. effective supply chain management technology  44 the critical challenge is to educate the consumer as to what rfid technology is and how it will benefit them, stressing lower retail prices as the main outcome. all the media used; print, radio, television, or internet based, has to be pro-active in anticipating questions and providing answers.  questions such as, \"are my personal shopping habits being divulged?\" or \"how do i know that i paid the right price for an individual item?\" can be answered before the consumer can even ask them.  the technology can be embraced and supported even before it reaches full roll out status. the entire conversion process will take time, tests musts be run, mistakes made, and the resulting learning incorporated as solutions.  however the final product will deliver a superior technology which will move the entire supply chain forward into the future; better, faster, cheaper.

       "  'text': 'oxirm research themes 25 years of supply chain management in retailing as reflected in oxirm research and publications by wojciech piotrowicz, research fellow, oxford institute of retail managementpage 40   oxirm research themesthe retail digest   page 41today, the terms \\'supply chain\\' and \\'supply chain management\\' are in common use. in the global economy, supply chain is part of everyday business across industries, and retailing is a leading example. on this 25th anniversary of the oxford institute of retail management we look at how the concept of supply chain management was introduced in retailing and how it has evolved over time. this exercise is based on a selective review of oxirm publications between 1990 and 2010, mainly articles from the retail digest (formerly the european retail digest).supply, distribution, and sourcing have always existed in retailing, even when they were labelled differently. international and even transcontinental trade have their precedents from centuries ago, when products were imported from all parts of the new world to europe, and local goods exported in the opposite direction. what has changed, however, is scale, speed, integration, transparency and control. today\\'s retailers have opportunities to manage and control the end-to-end flow of goods and associated information. to achieve the current level of supply chain integration, well over a decade was needed, during which different concepts, ideas and technical solutions were proposed, tried, adopted or rejected. in 1995, the european retail digest included an article by henk de wilt and trichy krishnan1, following an oxirm european retailing seminar dedicated to the concept of supply chain management. so let\\'s look how the concept of supply chain management evolved in retailing, how this was reflected in oxirm publications, and what was written about supply and logistics both before that digest article in 1995 and after.supply chain in the 1990s: birth and focus on efficiencyeven though supply chain management was present in the retail literature in the late 1980s and early  1990s, its function was still largely considered as operational, as part of the  retail distribution system. however, the potential strategic impact was noted by eminent retail academic and prolific writer john fernie in his book published in 1990 on retail distribution management. the european retail digest was established in 1993 as a flagship publication for the oxford institute of retail management. the quarterly publication\\'s aim was and remains to bring rigorous research and sound practice to academics, practitioners, analysts and commentators focused on the retail industry. earlier oxirm research was published in the series of oxford reports of retailing. in 1992, following the signing of the maastricht treaty that created a common market for 12 countries in europe, reports concentrated on retail internationalisation, where the importance of supply chain was acknowledged. free flow of goods across borders and transport deregulation influenced supply chain design, encouraging a european perspective instead of focusing at the national level. the creation of the common trans-european transport network (ten) was actively supported by the european commission with the establishment of \\'transport corridors\\', while changes in eastern and central europe opened new markets and provided lower-cost manufacturing. one of the internal success factors required for internationalisation was control over supply chains, which allows high responsiveness to changes in consumer tastes, as explained in the introduction to the oxford report on retail in the run-up to the 1992 treaty3. the importance of control over the supply chain, and the blurring of the division between retailing, distribution and manufacturing was discussed in the 1988 oxrim report written by alan treadgold and ross davies4.  in 1993, the concept of supply chain management as the next step in the development of physical distribution management and logistics management was already present in retailing, with a dedicated chapter in books, such as gary davies book on trade marketing strategy5. a similar trend was reflected in the european retail digest. efficient customer response (ecr) and its implications for just-in-time grocery supply chain were discussed, with the main focus on increased efficiency in the assortment, replenishment, promotions, and new product introductions. however this discussion was mainly based on us examples, revealing opportunities for efficiency improvements in the uk and france6. key drivers for supply chain developmentincreasing retailing concentration, centralisation and powerconcentration

sustainable supply chain management is the culmination of a three-year search for best practices in supply chain and logistics internationally. this book, written for supply chain and logistics managers and in cooperation with practitioners, answers questions such as:-  what is a successful supply chain strategy?-  how should supply chain performance be measured?-  how should organisation be managed?-  how should stakeholders be influenced?-  how can unexpected events be incorporated?we include examples from a wide range of real-life case studies, and synthesise the learning from these many different situations to provide the fundamental building blocks at the centre of successful logistics and supply chain management.environmental and social dimensions33, as well as differences in cultures and the different needs of different countries, including oxirm\\'s continued interest in developments in india34,35.supply chains today: latest oxirm researchbetween 2006 and 2010, oxirm members (including the author of this article) carried out research for the european commission, as part of the bestlog (best practices in logistics) project team. we looked at links  between supply chain and sustainable development, including areas such as: supply chain performance measurement36, education, best practices, and the transferability of best practices across industries, sectors, countries and regions37. our research was based not only on the academic literature and an analysis of existing case studies, but also our study of different supply chain practices across europe. we ran a number of workshops with policymakers and practitioners. the project covered several industrial sectors, and retailers, due to their important role in the supply chain, were well-represented. we collaborated with retailers such as ikea, marks & spencer, inditex and auchan, as well as with third-party logistics providers that work with retailers such as wincanton and unipart. while the bestlog project was formally completed, its work is carried forward by the european logistics association (visit elabestlog platform at www.elabestlog.org to see reports, analysis and best practice case studies – including cases from the retail sector).during the bestlog research we confirmed and indentified several main themes, which are summarised in a forthcoming book. the aim of the project was to help managers to develop supply chains that are sustainable in three dimensions: economic, social and environmental. while it is easy to label supply chains \\'green\\' for marketing purposes, to be sustainable in the long-term the whole chain should deliver economic value for all its participants. however, increasing centralisation, outsourcing of transportation and the tendency to design global supply chains creates external costs for the environment and society. as a result of supply chain redesign there is an increased need for transport services, especially in its most flexible form – road transport. external costs associated with transport include pollution, congestion and accidents, which also negatively influence retailers in terms of reduced speed, flexibility, costs, and potential damage to the company reputation. thus in the long-term, a reduction of the negative impacts could be profitable for all supply chain members. such a process requires the inclusion of sustainability issues into strategy and long-term planning, and the development of measures that reflect the impact of the supply chain on economic, social and environmental dimensions (see figure). the integration of products, processes, knowledge and infrastructure, as well as communication with all the relevant stakeholders is essential. as two large markets, india and china, develop rapidly, there is an opportunity to provide for the rising customer demand. however, this further increase in the scope of activities requires new skills to operate in different cultural and political contexts. in the search for efficiency and economy of scale, there is also the issue of how to maintain supply chain flexibility, agility in the face of uncertainty, and how to manage the expected and unexpected risks, as the supply chain become global.nowadays, the role of supply chain management is different, having evolved from being a supportive function, through becoming a core competence, to the stage where it enables the increased power of retailers over suppliers. today, retail has become the last step to the consumer in an integrated supply chain that links not only different markets, but also cultures, with the aim of delivering value to all its participants.1231cetinkaya et al.balkan cetinkaya · richard cuthbertson, graham ewer · thorsten klaas-wissing, wojciech piotrowicz ·

develop sustainable supply chains – economically, environmentally and socially.this book is not about a wish list of impractical choices, but the reality of decisions faced by all those involved in supply chain management today.our definition of sustainable supply chains is not restricted to so-called \"green\" supply chains, but recognises that in order to be truly sustain-able, supply chains must operate within a realistic financial structure, as well as contribute value to our society. supply chains are not sustain-able unless they are realistically funded and valued. thus, a real defini-tion of sustainable supply chain management must take account of all relevant economic, social and environmental issues.this book contains examples from a wide range of real-life case studies, and synthesizes the learnings from these many different situations to provide the fundame tal building blocks at the centre of successful logistics and supply chain management.sustainable supply chain

customer expectations and economic performance  gerald lang bem bordeaux management school, france ecole polytechnique preg-crg, france gerald.lang@bem.edu    abstract:  increasingly, store-based retailers are opening an additional online sales channel and becoming multi-channel retailers. the integration of these different channels raises the question how to redefine the strategic marketing elements and the operations, as the two channels have different constraints and require different competences. this multi-channel retailing has major impacts on the operations and the supply-chain management. order fulfillment for the customers using the different sales channels is a key challenge, as customers are directly impacted from the performance of this process. in this paper, we will highlight the different strategic elements and operational challenges to be addressed by a multi-channel retailer. in order to evaluate the match between a fulfillment system and a multi-channel business model, we propose a framework analyzing the overall performance of different fulfillment systems regarding the two dimensions customer expectations and economic performance.  key words: multi-channel, retail, fulfillment, distribution \\xa0hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  2  introduction a growing number of traditional store-based retailers are becoming multi-channel retailers by opening an additional online-channel to offer their customers multiple ways of buying and interaction. at the same time, former pure online-retailers are opening stores or physical pick-up points to allow their customers physical interaction and product pick-up. multi-channel retailing got primary attention principally in the field of multi-channel marketing (e.g. wirtz, 2008). marketing literature and scholarly research address multi-channel marketing mainly focusing on customer behavior on the one side (e.g. venkatesan et al, 2007) and the conflicts between channels on the other side (e.g. falk et al, 2007; avery et al, 2009). several authors (e.g. schröder, 2005; schobesberger, 2007; heinemann 2008, 2009) analyze different multi-channel strategies and implications on a retailers\\' marketing mix.  whereas operational implications of online retailing have received attention since the end of the 1990s (e.g. turban et al, 2009; swaminathan & tayur, 2003), specific analysis of operational implications of multi-channel retailing remains scarce. agatz et al (2008) reviewed the specific supply chain management issues of internet fulfillment in a multi-channel environment. they identified an important number of topics relevant for e-fulfillment, but recognized that there are only very few dedicated models on multi-channel retailing.  multi-channel retailers with different business models are using different fulfillment systems to deliver the products to their customers: the online shop of the french retailer fnac (cultural and electronics products), fnac.com, started its online activity completely separated from its store activity, with different warehouse locations and fulfillment organizations. they gradually integrated their logistics activities and are operating today a fully integrated warehouse, preparing deliveries for the stores as well as for the individual online customers. tesco.com, the online shop of the major uk retailer tesco, prepares the customer\\'s orders exclusively in the tesco store next to the customer (smith & sparks, 2009). so does monoprix.fr, the online shop of the french city-center supermarket chain monoprix. these observations suggest that a specific multi-channel business model may induce a specific, most suitable fulfillment system. if this is the case, it should then be possible to evaluate how a fulfillment system fits a given business model.  hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  3  from an operational point of view, fulfillment systems have to be mainly time- and cost-efficient. from a strategic marketing point of view, the fulfillment system has to be able to meet the customers\\' expectations created by the chosen business model. we therefore propose to develop a qualitative framework to evaluate how a specific multi-channel fulfillment system matches the business model of multi-channel retailers both in terms of the expectations of their customers on the one hand and the economic performances on the other hand. this framework should serve as basis for further empirical studies. our paper is organized in two parts: in the first part, we will highlight the main characteristics of multi-channel retailing and present the major elements of the retailers\\' strategy, the retail mix, which have to be adapted to a multi-channel retailing strategy. 1 we then will explore the specific operational challenges to be faced when operating a multi-channel activity.  this first part will be completed with the presentation of the five major multi-channel fulfillment systems used to deliver products to the customers. in the second part, we will propose a qualitative analysis framework in order to evaluate the overall performance of a given fulfillment system, combining the two dimensions \\'customer expectations\\' and \\'economic performance\\'. the parameters of the framework as well as its applications will be based on the analysis of the strategic and operational challenges developed in the first part. applying the analysis framework to the five major fulfillment systems leads us to discuss how each of the systems impacts the different parameters. we conclude our paper presenting managerial implications and suggested future research avenues to provide evidence if our framework is valid for our purpose.  methodology our analysis is based on the one hand on our longitudinal industry observation of retailers\\' practices, completed with the analysis of company information and press articles. moreover,                                                  1 in our paper, we will concentrate on multi-channel retailers operating at least several physical stores and an online sales channel under the same brand and with the same types of products. moreover, we focus on the distribution of physical products, as dematerialized products do not need a physical distribution. we exclude as well specific configurations (which may nonetheless be dominant in particular sectors), like delivery from manufacturers or \\'complex assortments\\' (de koster, 2002) with bulky items and temperature sensitive goods. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  4  we conducted a series of interviews with french and uk senior operations managers and consultants in the retail sector. this observation allowed us to identify five major multi-channel fulfillment systems. to be able to evaluate these fulfillment systems regarding the two dimensions \\'economic performance\\' and \\'customer expectations\\', we have to identify the relevant parameters to integrate into our proposed framework. to do so, we analyzed marketing and operations general literature and scholarly research. exploration of the main strategy elements and operational challenges suggests number of parameters, indicating economic performance and customer expectations. we completed the identified parameters for evaluating customer expectations with dimensions from the servqual and netqual scales, measuring service quality perception from the customers. these parameters of our framework will be the dependent parameters, whereas the analyzed fulfillment systems will be the independent parameters. the exploration of the strategy factors and economic performances in the first part will allow us to apply the framework to the different fulfillment models by assessing the chosen performance parameters for each of the fulfillment systems. this shall provide a global evaluation for the each of the analyzed fulfillment systems.  strategy factors in multi-channel retailing the objective of this chapter is to summarize the context of multi-channel retailing as well as the main drivers for customer expectations and economic performances, which will enable us to identify the relevant parameters to use in our proposed framework. we will first present the main characteristics of multi-channel retailing. we then will investigate how the business model of a multi-channel retailer, characterized by different elements of the retail mix, will have to be adapted to a multi-channel strategy. an exploration of the major operational challenges for a multi-channel retailer will conclude this chapter.  multi-channel retailing: characteristics & customer behavior worldwide retailing is still dominated by the traditional store retailing, as 95% of food retailing and 80% of non-food retailing is realized through physical store-based retailers (dioux & dupuis, 2009), and online channels still represent only a small part of the total sales of the retailers. nevertheless, the motivation to open online sales-channels is strong due to the fact that e-commerce is realizing important annual turnover growth rates of about 30% for the hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  5  last few years, whilst most other retail forms stay stable or even decline. it is therefore interesting for a store retailer to invest in the creation of an additional online sales channel.  to implement a multi-channel strategy, retailers have to decide how to adapt their business model by adjusting the elements of the retail mix. at the same time, they have to face and resolve numerous operational challenges. in multi-channel retailing, customers expect at least the same level of service, counsel, and information on every channel (cf. heinemann, 2008). they expect to have identical customer loyalty programs across all channels, to be able to pay and pick up in the shop a product ordered on the web site, or to be able to return and exchange a product bought on the web in a store (berman & thelen, 2004). this channel hopping, which is a legitimate desire from a customer\\'s point of view, may nevertheless prove to be very difficult to implement for the retailer (vanheems, 2009). at the same time, online shoppers transfer their perception and experiences from a physical store to the website of the same brand and vice versa. customers tend to transpose a bad experience in one channel to the other channels of the same distributor (heinemann, 2008). as soon as their expectations are not fulfilled, they may adapt their purchasing habits, in the worst case stop buying with this retailer at all. it is therefore vital for a multi-channel retailer to make sure that every channel always meets the same level of expectations of the customers.  multi-channel retail mix  the retail mix consists of the mix of variables, including geographical location, merchandising, communication, price, services, product range and the personnel, which form the overall strategic marketing components of a retailing activity. it is the right mix of all these factors which determines if a retail concept is viable and successful. compared to a store retailer, the online sales channel is not only a new channel, but rather a new business model, where experiences from the traditional (brick and mortar) store channel may not be valid any more (heinemann, 2008). decisive success factors in a store like store location, sales personnel and material management in the shop are not the same success factors in an online sales channel. retailers which decide to open an e-commerce activity beside their existing store sales channel have to make sure that the co-existence of the two sales channels is working well. they have to decide how to adapt the different elements of the retail mix to each channel, hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  6  which product strategy to chose, which prices to apply, how to maintain a consistent image across the channels or what role to assign to each channel, to name a few (cf. berman & evans, 2009). we will briefly describe the major issues of some of the most important variables of the retail mix, assessing their relevance and importance in the store, the online channel and the multi-channel strategy. product mix the product mix is the major variable determining the activity of a retailer. it establishes if a retailer is specialized in selected product categories or a generalist. if a store based retailer opens an additional online channel, he has to decide which product mix he offers on this new channel. he can offer the identical product mix, a combination or part of his existing product mix or a completely different additional product mix on the new channel. location of the stores a physical store\\'s success is to a great extend influenced by its location. in order to determine if the location can attract the store\\'s target customers, a store based retailer has to analyze socioeconomic data, transport access, mix of competitors, costs and regulation issues. these parameters, decisive for a physical store, have generally no influence on a pure online sales channel, as access to the websites is independent from a geographical location. in a multi-channel strategy, however, the store location remains important; the density of the store network can be an important factor for offering store pick-up, returns and after sales services in the stores for their online customers. pricing the pricing policy applied in a store may take into consideration the environment of the store (socioeconomic characteristics of the geographical catchment area) and the price levels of the local competitors. such a local pricing policy which can be applied in a store is incompatible with the global price transparency in an online channel and the exposure to price comparisons. the pricing policy of a multi-channel retailer encounters specific difficulties: the global price transparency on the internet, the specific cost structures of the store and the online channel, hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  7  the existence of specific offers and the different means of payment render it difficult to apply a consistent pricing policy across all channels. especially the price transparency makes it difficult for a retailer to offer different prices for the same product on different sales channels. service, store pick-up and return a multi-channel service offer can be composed of special delivery options (delivery speed, delivery timing, information on order status), the exchange policy, return policy, refunding, after sales service, payment options and consumer credits. multi-channel retailers can offer either to deliver the order to the customer\\'s home or to let the customer pick-up the order in one of the stores. this service allows the customer to pick up the order whenever he likes, even sooner than with home delivery.2 allowing customers in-store return or exchange can avoid the cost and time of returning via mail. at the same time, this offers an important possibility for the retailer to create a personal contact between the client and the sales personnel to increase customer loyalty and to generate additional sales. personnel the sales personnel play a decisive role in stores. they welcome clients, provide counsel and advice and can influence sales. their behavior and attitude contribute in an important way to the atmosphere and ambiance of the store and its concept.  this important parameter in a store is irrelevant in a pure online channel, except for telephone hotline contacts or the delivery service personnel. in a multi-channel strategy, however, the store personnel have to be able to orient and counsel the client using different channels. it is very important for the client not to perceive any differences or barriers between the channels.  operational challenges of multi-channel retailing in general, the operational organization of a retailer is mainly focused on efficient store replenishment, lowering costs and shortening the product turnover time.                                                  2 in case of unavailable items, the retailer can chose to send the missing items directly to the customer and only reserve the available items in the store for pick-up. in this case, the customer experience will be negative, as the customer\\'s decision to pick up his order in the store can\\'t be fulfilled.   hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  8  to offer an online channel to its customers, a retailer has to be able to manage its operations in a very different way from its physical store activity. e-fulfillment may be considered as one of the most expensive and critical operations of internet retailers (de koster, 2002), logistics and stock management becoming core competencies (benghozi, 2001). keeping stock of a high number of different references, making it available, picking and packing, sending and delivering quickly at a low cost are the numerous constraints to respect. in the following, we will present and discuss the main operational issues, which are decisive for the overall performance of the multi-channel retailing. product availability product availability is one of the most important parameters for customer satisfaction (browne, 2009). a store customer usually can compare the products present in the store. availability is indicated through the simple presence of a product in the store shelve. a customer can ask the sales personnel if there is any stock of the product or when it will be available again. an online client needs to have all this information indicated on the website together with the product information. the online channel offers the possibility to display the remaining stock of a chosen product, or even, in a multi-channel context, the remaining stock and the location of the store where the product is available for testing, purchasing or withdrawal. displaying the availability of products or the delay of their replacement is an important marketing tool impacting the sales and influencing customer satisfaction.  stock keeping stores usually receive deliveries either directly from the manufacturer or from one or several logistics platforms with either warehousing or cross-docking function. as online orders may consist of different products, composing the orders from different warehouse locations may prove to be difficult and inefficient in terms of cost and delivery time. a central warehouse and fulfillment center may therefore, at a first view, be more adapted to the online channel. however, multi-channel retailers may as well pick the items for an online order directly in the stores. for an online order, the retailer has some flexibility where from he delivers the products to his customers, as he can use multiple stock locations and therefore offer a wider product range than the one contained in a single warehouse, as multiple channels may share their hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  9  inventories. in-store inventories can therefore be available for online customers\\' orders (agatz et al, 2008). centralizing stock allows easier monitoring of the stock levels for different products. if a retailer is serving its online clients (totally or partially) from stock in the stores, the overall stock level on these different locations is difficult to monitor. this is the same problem for multi-channel retailers who offer the possibility to their customers to order online and withdraw the product in a nearby store. as information on product availability is a crucial parameter for the customers buying decision, the accuracy of the stock level information is very important. order taking and fulfillment in an online channel, the customer enters the type and number of products he wants to acquire and enters the payment information (usually done by credit cards), the online channel therefore becomes a self-service channel (falk et al, 2007). all this information entered by the customer triggers the order preparation and fulfillment process. retailers once delivering their stores from centralized distribution centers (often with complete boxes or pallets) have to re-think the way orders are prepared, as their organizations are not designed for small individual customers\\' orders. they must therefore be reorganized to treat these orders (de koster, 2002), implementing a process of single item picking and packing. as mentioned above, another option for the retailer is to pick the items in the stores, where the products are available on the shelves, and to prepare the order in the shops. furthermore, orders may be consolidated from multiple stock locations (for example from a warehouse and a store), which needs a specific process. the more complex the fulfilment process is organized, the more difficult it becomes to respect the quality and efficiency of this process. delivery to the customer besides the availability of the product, the different delivery options for a product are an important parameter for the online channel client. different delivery service levels offered like delivery in 24 hours, delivery to a pick-up point, national post service etc. are becoming a product differentiation factor of the retailer. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  10  delivery to the customers\\' homes, which is a distinctive element of an online channel, implies to deal with cost and organizational issues. the usually small transactions have to be managed and delivered in an efficient way, while respecting the promised delivery timing. the costs of the home delivery can be totally or partially paid by the customer. this becomes an important parameter of choice for the client, as no direct delivery costs appear in the store channel. on the other hand, the costs of delivery can be used as a marketing tool for special offers (\"your next order free of charge\") or minimum order amounts (\"delivery free of charge for every order above 100 euros\"). delivery becomes therefore a service parameter, a price parameter and a promotional parameter. reverse logistic store customers can usually see, touch and try the goods before purchasing. returns are limited and very often linked to an exchange of the product, where the returned product is put back into the shelves. defect products are reimbursed. as online customers cannot see, touch and try the products, online retailers usually offer good conditions for the customer to return the products they don\\'t like (due to legal and regulatory obligations, but as well as part of their customer service offer).  return handling must be quick in the eyes of the customers, either to get a product exchange or to get reimbursed and the customer account re-credited. the process must as well be efficient as it is a very manual process and impacts the stock management of the returned products (min et al, 2006). a physical store channel can be an easy way in the customer\\'s eyes to return the products. multi-channel fulfillment systems  to operate the multi-channel strategy, retailers have to set up a fulfillment system to deliver products to the customers. this fulfillment system, organizing the process from order intake to delivery to the customer, has to match the business model and to reply to the operational challenges. industry players are using different fulfillment systems, and several authors suggest typologies of fulfillment schemes, focusing on the locus of order preparation (de koster, 2002; durand, 2008). multi-channel retailing per se intends to offer the clients the choice where and how to order and where and how to get the products delivered. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  11  the major choice for the client is to shop in the store or shop online. if shopping online, the client can furthermore opt for delivery at home or pick up his products in one of the retailer\\'s stores.  the retailer has to set up a fulfillment system able to respect the client\\'s choice of the delivery mode, either by creating a new logistics infrastructure, or using the existing one, by adapting the existing processes. in order to be able to analyze the fulfillment systems from a customer expectation\\'s perspective, we decided to distinguish the fulfillment systems by the delivery option chosen by the customer: clients may either choose the direct home delivery for their purchases completed on the online channel or choose to pick up their purchased items in a physical store of the retailer. this in-store pick-up is a delivery option only multi-channel retailers can offer and which may be chosen to 30-40% of the customers at some multi-channel retailers (berman & thelen, 2004). a client going into a store in order to buy a product, searches, compares, picks the product out of the shelve and pays the product. single-channel store shoppers may therefore not be affected by the multi-channel fulfillment organization. 1. direct home delivery direct home delivery can be completed either by the retailer\\'s own delivery organization, a delivery logistics provider or via an external pick-up point network3. before entering in this \\'delivery pipeline\\', products have to be picked, prepared, packed and expedited, which can be done either in a central warehouse or distribution center, in a store, or in multiple locations (central warehouse and one or more stores).                                                   3 we consider a delivery via an external pick-up-point network (usually neighborhood shops linked to a network which offers the retreat of parcels for the clients of different retailers) like a home delivery, as the fulfillment process is quite identical, with a delivery of (sometimes pre-sorted) parcels to the pick-up point network\\'s injection hub. although this is influencing the ease of access, this way of delivery cannot provide a contact with the retailer as in his own store.  hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  12  1.1 direct delivery from central warehouse  picking, preparation and packing of ordered items can be done from a central warehouse stocking the products (figure 1.1). this central warehouse can either be a purpose-built entity to serve exclusively the online channel or the existing warehouse for the store operations (in which case the processes in the warehouse have to be adapted).  1.2 direct delivery from a store  picking, preparation and packing of the ordered items can be done inside a physical store out of the shelves. in this case, operators pick the products into a specific order preparation cart from the shelves and then pack and send the completed order to the customer (figure 1.2).   1.3 direct delivery after multi-stock consolidation  if the desired articles of an order are not available in one place, picking of the ordered items has to be done in a central warehouse as well as inside a physical store from the shelves. the picked items have then to be consolidated, prepared and packed in one site (figure 1.3). in some cases, the multichannel  figure 1.1: direct delivery from central warehouse figure 1.2: direct delivery from a store figure 1.3: direct delivery after multi-stock consolidation hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  13  retailer may opt for sending the order in two different parcels, to avoid the costs and delay of the consolidation.  2 client pick-up in the store a customer ordering online may choose to pick up his products in one of the retailer\\'s stores. in this case, products have to be picked, prepared, packed and kept ready for pick-up in the store. 2.1 direct in-store order preparation  if all the products of the customer\\'s order are available in the store chosen by the customer to pick-up, the picking, preparation and packing of the order can be done immediately in the store (figure 2.1).     2.2 in-store order consolidation from multiple stocks  if some of the products of the customer\\'s order are not available in the store chosen by the customer for pick-up, the unavailable items must be ordered from the central warehouse (or other stores) to complete the order. the preparation and packing of the order can be done only after consolidation of all items in the store (figure 2.2). (a specific case of this in-store order consolidation can be a complete order  preparation in a central warehouse sent to the store only to be picked up by the customer, without further adding any product in the store).  figure 2.1: direct in-store order-preparation figure 2.2: in-store order consolidation from multiple stocks hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  14  the analysis framework in this part, we will first determine the parameters to integrate in our proposed framework. we then will apply this framework to the five abovementioned fulfillment systems and discuss the results. we will conclude this part discussing the limitations of the framework, suggestions for further research and managerial implications.  customer expectations and economic performance having analyzed the main strategy factors and operational challenges, and identified the five major fulfillment systems, we now have to determine the parameters to include into our proposed framework in order to evaluate these fulfillment systems. the different fulfillment systems lead to different levels of complexity, of costs and of product availability and therefore different levels of customer satisfaction and economic performance. to explore how a fulfillment system fits a given business model, we have to evaluate the overall performance of the different multi-channel fulfillment systems, combining the two angles of analysis:  on the one hand, we analyze to which extend a given fulfillment system is able to meet the customer expectations. on the other hand, we analyze the economic performance of each model. in our proposed framework, we will confront the different fulfillment systems to several parameters which are relevant for the customer expectations and the economic performance. the fulfillment systems may be considered as the independent variables of our analysis, whereas the different parameters of our framework represent the dependent variables. the identification of these parameters results from the exploration of the main strategy elements and operational challenges. concerning the economic performances of fulfillment, we propose to assess different dimensions of the overall fulfillment efficiency, combining widely used indicators to describe logistics and fulfillment performances (e.g. in agatz et al, 2008): ‐  stock efficiency (indicating reliable sales forecasts and optimized product replenishment to reduce stock-risk, capability of monitoring stock levels across different stock locations and the capability of balancing stock between different locations) ‐  picking efficiency (indicating efficient organization of stock and picking zones for picking and order preparation) hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  15  ‐  delivery cost efficiency (indicating the total cost of delivery from the stock(s) to the customers\\' home or to the desired store for pick-up) ‐  channel organization efficiency (indicating the information exchange between sales channels and real time availability of data) ‐  fulfillment infrastructure costs (indicating the necessary investments, rents or outsourcing costs for the fulfillment infrastructure) ‐  return handling efficiency (indicating the speed and quality of the return handling process, from product reception to exchange or reimbursement for the client)  analysis in the first part of this paper suggests three parameters indicating the customer expectations: ‐  product availability (indicating the availability of the desired products) ‐  speed of delivery (indicating the time between the order placement and the reception of the products by the customers) ‐  ease of access and return of products (indicating the ease for a client either to get the products delivered/to pick them up or to return/exchange the products received) in order to assess more precisely how a fulfillment system corresponds to the customer expectations, we completed these parameters with parameters from the servqual framework, developed by parasuraman et al (1988) to measure service quality. nevertheless, this traditional service quality may not be applicable in an online environment (parasuraman et al, 2005). bressolles (2006) developed the netqual framework to specifically assess electronic service quality.  as multi-channel retailing provides both \\'traditional\\' and \\'online\\' service experiences, we have to combine these two approaches in order to identify all the relevant dimensions to customer expectations and retain only those which may be directly impacted by the fulfilment model.  therefore, we selected the following dimensions out of the servqual and netqual scales for our analysis: ‐  quality and quantity of information ( netqual) (indicating the availability and correctness of the information provided in terms of product availability, stock level, delivery times etc. either on the website or in the stores)  hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  16  ‐  reliability and respect of commitments (servqual & netqual) (indicating the ability to deliver the products in terms of quantity, price, description and timing) ‐  offer (netqual) (indicating the lengths and the width of the product range available on the different channels) ‐  assurance (servqual) (indicating the competence and friendliness of the personnel usually in the store for buying, pick-up and exchange transactions of the client).  we did not retain those dimensions having only an indirect link with the fulfillment systems. these elements constitute the analysis framework we propose to analyze the overall performance of specific fulfillment systems. application of the analysis framework  we are now able to apply this proposed framework to the five identified fulfillment systems according to our objective to evaluate the fit between a multi-channel retailer\\'s business model and a specific fulfillment system. to be able to analyze each of the abovementioned fulfillment systems, we will explore the sensitivity of each of the parameters regarding the main characteristics of the different fulfillment systems.4 we apply numerical scores to each parameter, depending if the efficiency of this parameter is high (2), medium (1) or low (0). this qualitative evaluation, based on the discussion of the different elements of the retail mix and the operational challenges, aims to compare the relative efficiency of one parameter in different fulfillment systems. we do not intend to provide an absolute performance test. quality and quantity of information customers expect correct information, especially on pricing and delivery costs of the different channels, but as well on other parameters like product availability, speed of delivery and product characteristics. the retailer\\'s challenge is always to have the right information available on every channel.                                                  4 each of the above identified parameters expressing customer expectations and economic performance of a specific fulfillment system has multiple implications on other parameters. it is to retain that these parameters may be interdependent (e.g. the width of the product offer impacts the product availability, the picking efficiency and the fulfillment infrastructure costs).  hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  17  using a centralized stock provides the highest chance to have the right information available (score: 2), whereas an order preparation from stores induces the problem of obtaining the right information on the store stock level (score: 1). if the order preparation has to be completed on several stock locations (central warehouse and stores), it is very difficult to obtain correct information and the quality of information may be low (score: 0). reliability and respect of commitments customers expect retailers to keep their promises, especially in terms of delivery time and delivery service. central warehouse order preparation should facilitate this, as the quality of information is high and the fulfillment process can be optimized (score: 2). order preparation in the stores suffers from difficulties in keeping a real-time stock level of all the products. therefore, store preparation may guarantee only a medium level of reliability and respect of commitments (score: 1), whereas multi-stock order preparation may only provide a low level (score: 0).  offer customers expect to find the offer they expect on every channel, a large or narrow product range with the appropriate depth of assortment. the retailer has to make sure to be able to offer the products customers expect on every channel. order fulfillment at a central warehouse or from multiple stocks should be capable to provide the entire range of the products (both score: 2), order preparation at the store is limited to the only product assortment in stock at the store (score: 0). product availability the customer expects that the products he intends to buy are available in the channel he desires to use. a central warehouse order preparation may provide only a medium level of product availability (score: 1) compared to the other options, as the availability depends on the stock keeping and forecasting precision of this single warehouse. stores can only guarantee a low level of product availability because of the small number of stock for every referenced product and the continuous buying from customers in the store (score: 0).  multi-stock order preparation may use the stock of different entities (stores and central warehouse) and therefore guarantee a very high level of product availability (score: 2), especially in case of a high number of articles per customer order. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  18  speed of delivery customers usually expect a rapid delivery of the products they bought and to be informed about the delivery timing. retailers therefore have to implement a fast and reliable delivery process, which may imply an external delivery service provider. a central warehouse usually needs to bridge the distance to the final customer, which may be long and therefore time-consuming. a medium level of speed of delivery may therefore be guaranteed (score: 1). as stores are closer to the final customer, the speed of delivery can be high when orders are prepared in the store (score: 2). orders prepared from multiple stock locations need a long time to be consolidated and can therefore only provide a low relative delivery speed (score: 0). ease of access and return of products customers expect easy access to the retailer to either pick up the products ordered or to return or exchange a product in case of dissatisfaction. home delivery from a central warehouse may make returns and exchange difficult for customers (score: 0), who have to use a postal service for returning the products (except in the case the retailer owns a quite dense network of stores and the store channel is fully integrated to handle returns and exchange from the online channel). order preparation in the store is usually done in the store closest to the customer. this store is therefore easy to access for the customer (score: 2). multi-stock preparation can only provide a medium level of ease of access and return (score: 1). although the customer can return a product to the closest store, exchange can be impossible if the products to be exchanged are only available at another stock location. assurance the customers expect competent and friendly personnel in the store for buying, picking up their orders, return or exchange. the same expectation may apply for the personnel on telephone customer hotlines or the delivery personnel. these functions being very often outsourced (especially the latter), retailers have to focus on their own sales personnel and make sure they provide the level of assurance the customer is expecting by providing the same information to all channels. the assurance of the personnel can only be provided in the case of order pick-up of the customer in the stores (score: 2; other option scores: 0). hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  19  stock efficiency for the retailer, the efficiency of stock management is crucial for numerous reasons. stock keeping and monitoring of stock levels, balancing between different stock locations and the forecasting of sales and product reorders influence the availability of the products and therefore the sales. efficient stock handling is as well an important cost element. central stock management can provide a high level of efficiency (score: 2), whereas a store can only provide a medium efficiency (score: 1) because of the low number of products per article and the continuous stock movement due to customers purchases out of the shelves. the handling of multiple stocks in the fulfillment process is the least efficient (score: 0). picking efficiency the picking of products out of stock to prepare the customer\\'s order is the key process of the overall fulfillment process, representing a very important part of the warehouse operating costs. this process is nevertheless transparent to the customer. a central warehouse can be organized in a way to optimize the picking process by planning and reducing the way picking operators have to go during the process (score: 2). depending on the volumes and the type of articles, it is possible to split the stock for whole cartons or open cartons picking or separate zones for stocking and picking. this optimization cannot be provided in a store or in multiple stock sites (scores: 0). stores\\' layouts and product locations are planned to make the customer spend the maximum time in the store and not to optimize the picking (de koster, 2002). delivery cost efficiency customers expect to pay the lowest extra cost possible for the delivery of their online orders and the retailer has to reduce the overall cost of the delivery. delivery of orders prepared in a central warehouse has always to include the transport to the customer\\'s home and therefore only achieve a medium efficiency (score: 1) compared to the delivery from a store (score: 2), where the distance to the final customer is short. pick-up by the customer from the store where the order was prepared is the less costly way of delivery for the retailer. any delivery from an order prepared in multiple stock locations (for home delivery or to a store for pick-up) is least efficient (score: 0), as the consolidation process of the order implies multiple costs of handling and transportation. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  20  channel organization efficiency as stated above, customers want to be able to use different channels simultaneously. a retailer has therefore to manage all the channels in an integrated manner.  preparing orders for home delivery from a central warehouse is the simplest and most efficient organization (score: 2). order preparation in the store involves the online and the store channel in the fulfillment process, therefore adding a level of complexity (score: 1). multi-stock preparation adds further complexity, being therefore the most difficult solution to achieve an efficient channel organization (score: 0). fulfillment infrastructure costs the fulfillment process may generate important investment costs, when a specific site is built as the stock and the distribution center, or if the design and the organization of an existing facility have to be modified. renting or outsourcing this infrastructure generates additional costs as well. a central warehouse order preparation generates a high infrastructure cost (score: 0), whereas the store preparation generates the lowest additional infrastructure costs (score: 2). order preparation from multiple stocks may generate medium additional infrastructure costs (score: 1) to organize the consolidation of the orders. return handling efficiency customers expect their returns to be processed quickly, to receive an exchange product or to get reimbursed the purchasing price. the retailer must therefore provide a quick and efficient return handling process. a central warehouse enables creation of optimized return processing (score: 2) to check the returns, repack and restock them and send the exchange items to the customers. multi-stock fulfillment can only provide a lower rate of return efficiency (score: 1), as the returned items arrive in different locations and the exchange items may only be available on different stock locations. for a store it is very difficult to offer an optimized return process (score: 0), especially when returned products are not part of the store\\'s product offer.  we can therefore summarize the impacts of the different fulfillment systems on the different parameters as follows (figure 3):  hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  21  figure 3: the analysis framework   home delivery  customer store pick-up fulfillment  system  1.1 1.2 1.3 2.1 2.2  prepared  in central warehouse prepared in store prepared in multiple stocks prepared in store prepared in multiple stocks customer expectations       quality and quantity of information  high (2)  medium (1)  low (0)  medium (1)  low (0) reliability and respect of commitments  high (2)  medium (1)  low (0)  medium (1)  low (0) offer  medium (1)  low (0)  high (2)  low (0)  high (2) product availability  medium (1)  low (0)  high (2)  low (0)  high (2) speed of delivery  medium (1)  high (2)  low (0)  high (2)  low (0) ease of access and return of products  low (0)  high (2)  medium (1)  high (2)  medium (1) assurance  low (0)  low (0)  low (0)  high (2)  high (2)        economic performance       stock efficiency  high (2)  medium (1)  low (0)  medium (1)  low (0) picking efficiency   high (2)  low (0)  low (0)  low (0)  low (0) delivery cost efficiency  medium (1)  high (2)  low (0)  high (2)  low (0) channel organization efficiency  high (2)  medium (1)  low (0)  medium (1)  low (0) fulfillment infrastructure costs efficiency low (0)  high (2)  medium (1)  high (2)  medium (1) return handling efficiency  high (2)  low (0)  medium (1)  low (0)  medium (1)        total score customer expectations 7 6 5 8 7 total score economic performance 9 6 2 6 2 total 16 12  7  14  9   this indicates several results: - home delivery from a central warehouse (system 1.1) is the fulfillment system best meeting the combination of the two dimensions customer expectations and economic performance, providing a total score of 16. this system provides the highest score in economic performance (9) and the second highest score in customer expectations (7). - customer pick-up after preparation in the store (system 2.1) provides the highest score in customer expectation (8) and a medium score in economic performance (6). the overall performance of this system is second best (total score of 14). - home delivery after store preparation (system 1.2) provides medium scores in customer expectations (6) and economic performance (6), ranking third best in the overall score (12).  - any fulfillment system implying the order preparation out of multiple stocks appears to be less efficient: if the order is picked up by the customer (system 2.2), the total score is 9, if the hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  22  order is delivered at home (system 1.3), the total score is only 7. in terms of economic performance, these two systems provide the lowest score (2). - economic performances of order preparation in the store or from multiple stocks are identical for both home delivery or in-store pick up by the customer. the difference in customer expectations (difference of 2) results from the possibility to have a personal contact with the customer, therefore responding to the customer expectation of \\'assurance\\', which can only be provided in a store. discussion, managerial implications and research avenues  the qualitative analysis of the different fulfillment systems and their impact on customer expectations and economic performance reveals that different fulfillment systems can provide high overall performance levels in terms of customer expectations and economic performance. the framework shows that orders for home delivery prepared in a central warehouse present only a slightly higher overall performance than an order prepared in a store for customer store-pick-up. a retailer has to assess the importance of each of the analyzed parameters for his specific retail mix and to optimize the trade-offs between channel fulfillment synergies and specific needs on different channels. depending on the product mix between food and non-food products, the width of product assortment and the characteristics of the existing store network, specific solutions may be more appropriate than others to fit with a specific business model. whereas proximity to customers is best achieved through a store network, stores add complexity on different levels in the fulfillment process which affect timing, costs and reliability. multi-stock consolidation seems to be always by far the less efficient model, regarding the customer expectations and the economic performance. this corresponds to the three initially mentioned multi-channel retailers: fnac abandoned the multi-stock preparation and completely integrated their fulfillment for the different channels, and neither tesco nor monoprix apply a multi-stock solution, whilst optimizing the in-store order preparation. hal-00560956, version 1 - 31 jan 2011rirl 2010 - bordeaux september 30th & october 1st, 2010  23  our proposed framework could prove useful for multi-channel retailers in various ways: it provides a tool to evaluate the chosen fulfillment system and therefore identifying improvement potentials on specific parameters. it could also provide helpful to measure customer satisfaction. moreover, it should clearly be useful in anticipating the needs for fulfillment systems when planning to implement a multi-channel strategy. the proposed qualitative framework should be further validated by conducting supplementary empirical analysis, although it may be difficult to compare economic performances and customer expectations of different fulfillment systems in a same company. another difficulty may be to isolate the impacts of the supply chain from other impacts (marketing, pricing, product policy etc.). a limitation of our framework is the fact that it does not assess the interdependencies between the different dependent parameters, but only focuses on one major impact at a time. a first step to further back this framework could be to conduct a dynamic analysis through a simulation, testing values for the different parameters of the analysis framework. research could aim to find evidence if there is an \\'optimum\\' fulfillment system for every multi-channel retailer. such an optimal model could be defined depending on different independent variables like product assortment, average number of items per shopping basket, value of products, product characteristics, degree of channel integration etc. this would also include an analysis of the trade-off between cost- and customer service level optimization. such a research could as well reveal that there is no optimum model, but just a set of independent and non stabilized models evolving quickly as the retailers\\' strategy mix evolves.   acknowledgement  the work on this paper was partially supported by the innovation and regulation chair of orange, ecole polytechnique, telecom paris. hal-00560956, version 1 -

    "sample_text = 'software quality assurance audits guidebooknovember 1990prefacethe growth in cost and importance of software to nasa has causednasa to address the improvement of software development acrossthe agency. one of the products of this program is a series ofguidebooks that define a nasa concept of the assurance processesthat are used in software development.the software assurance guidebook, nasa-gb-a201, issued inseptember, 1989, provides an overall picture of the nasa conceptsand practices in software assurance. second level guidebooksfocus on specific activities that fall within the softwareassurance discipline, and provide more detailed information forthe manager and/or practitioner.this is the second level software quality assurance auditsguidebook that describes software quality assurance audits in away that is compatible with practices at nasa centers. for amore generalized view of how software quality assurance auditsrelate to software assurance, refer to the software assuranceguidebook, document number nasa-gb-a201.i. generalthe nasa software assurance guidebook classifies the softwarequality assurance (sqa) audit as a fundamental quality assurancetechnique. it is the intent of this guidebook to further defineaudits, describe the audit process, and provide a samplechecklist that can be tailored for use in an audit. theguidebook is written for quality assurance practitioners who willperform audits, software developers who will be audited, and forsoftware project managers and acquirers who have to decide theextent of auditing to be done.https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?r=19980228457 2020-06-15t23:30:49+00:00zin this guidebook, the term \"audit\" specifically refers to an sqatechnique that is used to examine the conformance of adevelopment process to procedures and the conformance of productsto standards. an sqaaudit also can examine the conformance ofthe actual status of the development activity to the reportedstatus. the term \"audit\" is used to describe a numberofadditional software activities; however, due to their differentpurpose and focus, they are not addressed in this guidebook. forexample, the functional configuration audit (fca)and physicalconfiguration audit (pca)are configuration management(cm)activities. quality (engineering) audits and safety audits aretechnical activities that evaluate a software product againstquality engineering and safety requirements. these types ofaudits are not covered in this guidebook.ii. conceptsanddefinitionsan sqaaudit is an activity that is performed to determine theadherence to, and adequacy of, a project\\'s established softwaredevelopment standards and procedures and the effectiveness oftheir implementation. as used in this guidebook, the mainobjective of an sqaaudit is to determine the adherence toestablished standards and procedures; checking their adequacy oreffectiveness is a secondary objective that usually is notrequested of an auditor.in the nasasoftware assurance guidebook, standards are definedas \"the established criteria to which software products arecompared.\" software standards include documentation standards,design standards, and coding standards. in that guidebook,procedures are defined as the \"established criteria to which thedevelopment and control processes are compared.\" procedures,then, are the step-by-step directions that are to be followed toaccomplish somedevelopment or control process; for example, cmor nonconformancereporting and corrective action (nrca). inother words, standards and procedures are requirements forsoftware management,engineering, and assurance; sqaauditsverify their existence and assess a project\\'s compliance withthem.sqaaudits also can comparethe actual status of a product withreported status. status auditing is most effective if there areobjective and consistent criteria for evaluating the level ofproduct completeness. for example, unit developmentfolders(udfs)have a cover sheet for recording the progress of a unitthrough its development stages; the folder contains the actualproduct. if a project uses udfs, then an audit can comparetheactual product to the cover sheet and to the progress report.the actual processes and products examined by an audit will varydepending on the objective of the audit. the objective of theaudit can vary, and is determined by the organization that calledfor the audit. a general audit provides a comprehensiveoverview, while a limited audit might be an examination ofcertain procedures, such as cm, or a check on a certainrequirement, such as \"are coding standards being followed?\"an audit maybe described as internal or external, depending onthe organization of origin of the auditor(s). an internal auditis an audit conducted by the sqastaff of the software developer.internal audits are intended to be preventative in nature; todetect problems before they becomemajor.an external audit is one performed by an independent auditor whois outside of the developing organization. external audits aremost often requested by the acquiring organization, as a meansofobtaining an independent opinion about the work in progress.external audits tend to be more comprehensive in nature thaninternal audits, and usually encompassa broad area of thedevelopment activity. such audits usually are requested becausethe acquirer is uncertain of the effectiveness of the internalprogram or because of lack of information and fears about thequality of performance on the part of the developer. anadvantage of an external audit is that the auditor maybe moreobjective about a project than an internal auditor; however, anexternal auditor must spend more time learning about the projectand its development process.iii. conductingansqaauditan sqaaudit has four phases: planning and preparation, the sitevisit, reporting, and follow-up. during the planning andpreparation phase, the auditor gains an understanding of theproject. based on the scope of the audit, the auditor determinesthe specific questions that need to be answered, as well as thepersons to be interviewed and the records and products to beexamined to answer the questions. the interviews are conducted,and records and products are examined during the site visit. thereporting phase consists of the exit debriefing of the auditedproject, the preparation of a written report on the audit, andclarifying issues and providing related information as needed.follow-up is done by the project, as the problems anddeficiencies found in the audit are remedied. follow-up mayinclude reauditing to assess the adequacy of the remedies.the activities conducted during the phases vary depending on thelife cycle phase of the project being audited and the scope ofthe audit. the activities also vary depending on whether theaudit is external or internal; an external audit requires moreextensive preparation and should examine a more comprehensivesample of material than an internal audit.each of the four phases of an audit is described in the followingsections. the activities of each phase are described as if ageneral, external audit is to be done since this results in thegreatest detail. someof the activities maybe superfluous to aninternal sqaaudit and maybe omitted.a. audit planning and preparationa general sqaaudit should be planned carefully to examine all ofthe software engineering, management,and assurance processes andall of their products. software managementprocesses includestatus reporting and cm. engineering processes include analysis,design, and code. assurance processes include verification andvalidation (v&v)and nrca. products include documentsand code.if the scope of the audit is more limited, then planning will bewithin the defined limits. a limited audit might examine onlyone of the processes or a limited set of products. activitiesduring the planning and preparation phase are similar for allaudits, but preparation for a limited audit is focused on theidentified process or product.as a first step, the auditor should understand the objective ofthe software development project and what products are to beproduced. the auditor needs to know what the contract requiresin the way of deliverable software and documentation, and what,if any, requirements exist for management,engineering, andassurance practices. onesource of this information maybe thestatement of work and other contract documents. onceit is clearwhat is being developed and what the contract requires, theauditor should review managementdocumentation, such as thesoftware management,development, and assurance plans tounderstand the processes that will be used to develop and controlthe products. then the developer\\'s standards and proceduresmanual should be reviewed to determine the quality standards andthe detailed procedures planned to be applied to the software andthe development process. from this background information, theauditor should be able to understand the developer\\'s softwaredevelopment process.the auditor also should review somerecent status reports fromthe developer. these reports will furnish information on thestage of completeness of products and maycontain information asto problem areas.after background familiarization and a look at project status,the auditor should define the areas that will require the mostcareful and detailed attention, i.e., the processes or productsthat seemto be in somedifficulty or whosestatus is in doubt.these areas maybe identified by the status reports, discussionswith the acquirer of the software (if it is the acquirer who hasrequested the audit), review of nonconformancereports, and theresults of previous audits.oncethe auditor understands the project and has identified theareas of concentration, he/she should develop a checklist. achecklist is a list of items to be examined and questions to beasked. each checklist should be tailored for the specificproject being audited and its life cycle phase and should reflectthe scope of the audit. a more comprehensive and less detailedchecklist is required for a general audit; a limited auditrequires a checklist that is more detailed in specific areas.guidance on preparing a checklist is given in chapter vi. achecklist is intended to provide the auditor with a \"road map\"during the site visit. it must be complete, so that the auditorcan know that sufficient information has been gathered if all ofthe checklist items are completed. the checklist questions helpdefine the individuals with whomthe auditor wishes an interviewand the types of records that the auditor will examine.the auditor should schedule the site visit to the project throughits assurance staff or other suitable contact after thepreparation is done and the checklist prepared. during thiscontact with the project, the auditor should specify the intentof the audit, the records to be examined, and which people theauditor wishes to interview. people to be interviewed willinclude managers, selected developers, cmstaff, assurance staff,and testers. copies of the checklist maybe furnished toincrease the project\\'s understanding. the project should beprepared to provide the auditor with a convenient working areathat includes normal office facilities, access to all productsand records, and interviews with the identified individuals.b. the site visitthe purpose of the audit site visit is to collect the datanecessary to assess that the required products are beingproduced, the degree to which they conform to applicablestandards, how well procedures are being followed, and that thereported status corresponds to the actual status. the audit isintended to uncover any significant deviation from standards,procedures, or reported status so that corrective action can betaken. the auditor uses two basic techniques: interviews withproject staff and examination of documentation and records.the site visit should begin with an entrance briefing, involvingthe auditor and key project staff. during this briefing, theauditor should describe the focus of the audit, and identify theinterviews to be conducted and the records to be examined. theentrance briefing mayalso be used by the project to brief theauditor on its processes, key staff members,and current status.time for questions and answers should be included. the auditoralso should assure the project that an exit interview will beheld where the auditor will present preliminary findings to theproject and the project mayprovide any additional information tothe auditor. this preliminary exchange of information cansignificantly help to allay the fears of the project and tosmooth the course of the site visit.after the entrance briefing, the auditor should proceed with thegathering of information. it is useful to begin the informationgathering process with interviews, during which the auditor triesto understand the realities behind the documentedplans andprocedures. the auditor should learn which individuals carry outa procedure, approve a change or fix, keep project records, etc.each individual should be asked to describe his/her perceptionsof and interactions with the process. the auditor should takenotes, annotate or develop procedural flow diagrams, askquestions to clarify, and makeit his/her objective to clearlyunderstand the process. in particular, the auditor should bealert for indications of shortcuts or abbreviations to theprocedure. during interviews, the auditor must rememberthatdata are being gathered, and that conclusions should wait untilall of the facts are in. this provides a clearer understandingof the actual processes used on the project and easescommunications with the staff. the checklist developed duringthe preparation phase is used to guide the discussions during theinterview.oncethe auditor is sure that the processes and procedures areunderstood as they really exist, he/she should begin examiningthe tangible parts of the project: its products and records.products consist of requirements and design documentation,including unit development folders, user manuals, code, etc.records consist of memorandaand forms that document the eventsin the life of a product. they comefrom cm, nrca,and v&v,amongothers.i. records examinationthe auditor examines records to see if a procedure is beingcorrectly followed. record examination is described below interms of the principal processes that sqaaudits examine: cm,nrca,and v&v. similar activities would be used in theexamination of other sets of records.• cmauditduring an audit of cm, the auditor should look at the completechange control cycle, beginning with the initial processing of achange request; through analysis of impact and dispositioning;design, code, and testing; updating of documentation; submissionof the modified products to the library; and closure of thechange request. records to be examined include the changerequests as processed by the changecontrol board, the workauthorizing documents issued as a result of approved changes, thecode and documentation products that are intended to reflect theapproved changes, and the program library records that capturethe changes to code and data. throughout the audit, the auditorshould be alert for and documentany evidence of unauthorizedchanges.the records should show the authorization of each change, theproduct(s) to be changed, and the version numbersof the changedproduct. muchof the auditor\\'s attention should be devoted tothe program library or equivalent, since this is where thevarious versions of products and the change documentscontrollingthose versions are stored. the auditor should check the productsin the library to ensure that documentation is up-to-date withcode changes. the auditor should check the version numbering andidentification schemes, and the control documents. the recordsshould demonstrate that there are adequate security measures inplace to prevent loss and unauthorized changes. the auditorshould verify that every item of code and documentation in theprogram library was properly received.• nrcaauditwhenauditing the nrcasystem, the auditor should look at thecomplete cycle. the auditor should review the nonconformancereports that are filed, to assure that they are completely andcorrectly filled out. the disposition process and board actionsshould be recorded, usually on the sameform. thenonconformancesthat result in product changes should be trackedto the product, and evidence should be gathered that changes aremade, tested or reviewed, and approvals for issuance are granted.the nrcaprocedures will parallel those used in cm, and can beaudited in muchthe sameway, especially whenit comesto theprogram library. in both cases (cmand nrca),the auditor shouldpay particular attention to corrected products to assure thatthey still satisfy requirements and standards.• v&vauditan audit of v&vprocedures should include a check of theverification matrix or equivalent, to assure that everyrequirement has a test and every test checks a requirement. testplans should be adequate, specifying the test environment, testprocedures, and the expected results for each test. testprocedures should be clear and detailed. test plans andprocedures should be reviewed and approved.the auditor should verify from sqarecords that test procedureswere followed and that all nonconformancesobserved duringtesting are recorded in the nrcasystem. in addition to testing,the auditor should assess other methods of v&v, if used. forexample, if inspections or another form of peer reviews are usedto find problems, the auditor should verify that the records ofthe review show that they were done and that corrections andchanges agreed to in the review are madein the product.2. product examinationthe intent of examination of products is two-fold: to see ifstandards are being followed, and to see if status is accuratelyreported. documentsare measuredagainst documentationrequirements to makesure that all required documentsexist, andagainst documentation standards to ensure that they have thecorrect content and style. the auditor must read enough of thedocumentsto form an opinion on the above; that is, the auditormust be able to determine that a documentpresented as showingthe design indeed contains design information. on the otherhand, the auditor is not responsible for the technicalcorrectness of the documentsand should not spend time trying toascertain if the documentsare correct.codealso is examined to determine if it meets standards. codestandards are likely to include rules for internal documentation,size of modules, styling formats, and other such items that theauditor can verify. rules for coding constructs or variablenaming conventions are more difficult to verify. if the projecthas a code standards checker, the auditor mayrun it on somecode. if the standards checker is to be run at a certain step inthe development process, or if peer reviews are used to verifycoding standards, the auditor must have access to those records.products also are examined to comparetheir status with thatreported. documentsreported as complete, for example, shouldcontain all of the sections given in the table of contents (whichmaybe prescribed by a documentation standard), should be signedby the approving authorities, and should contain few, if any, to-be-determined (tbds)items. codeimplementation usually goesthrough the steps of detailed design, code, peer review, and unittest. a module that is reported as complete should have gonethrough all of the above steps, should meet the coding standards,and should have whatever approvals are required. the unitdevelopmentfolder or equivalent should contain all of theevidence to look at status of coding.3. samplingduring the process of checking records and products, the auditorusually cannot examine each and every item; therefore, somesampling process must be used. the auditor must decide on samplesizes that can be accommodatedin the site visit. the samplesizes must be balanced between completeness of coverage (someitems from each product or set of records) and depth of coverage(numberof items from a specific product or set of records) . ifthe focus of the audit is limited, the sample size can be largerfor the specific product or processes that are to be covered. indeciding on sample sizes, the auditor must allow time to followup in more depth in areas where the initial sample indicatesproblems. the specific products or records to be included in thesample should be chosen by some\"randomizing\" method, and theproject staff should not be informed in advance which items willbe examined and which will not.c. audit reportingoncethe interviews and record examination have been completed,initial results should be shared with the staff of the auditedproject during an exit interview. the exit interview provides anopportunity to clear up misunderstandings and allows projectstaff to present any information that they feel the auditorfailed to consider. in addition, project staff learn immediatelyabout the problems that have been found and can begin makingplans to correct them.after adjusting the initial results to reflect the informationgathered in the exit interview, the auditor prepares a writtenfinal report. the report should be organized to highlight themost significant results, addressing both problems andcommendations, and should include a general narrative of theaudit. an example table of contents for an audit report is shownin appendix a. the audit report should be addressed to themanagementofficial who arranged for the audit, if the audit isexternal; or directed as required by procedures, if internal.the objective of the audit report is to present a clear pictureof the status of a development activity or a facet of theactivity to project management. the report must be clear,objective, and factual. in somecases, the auditor will findthat, while procedures are being followed or standards are beingmet, the procedures or standards are not effective in producing aquality product. it is the responsibility of the auditor to notethe specific problems caused by the procedure and/or standard andinclude them in the report. in general, however, problems thatthe auditor identifies should be related to project orcontractually-required procedures and standards; the auditor\\'sopinion of their desirability should not affect his/herevaluation of the adherence to them.d. follow-upwhile the auditor\\'s role is essentially finished after producingthe audit report, actions to resolve deficiencies identified inthat report must be taken by project management. problems thatare feasible and reasonable to correct should be converted toaction items and assigned to appropriate individuals. arationale should be developed for those that are not to becorrected. it is the responsibility of the developers to improvetheir processes in response to deficiencies identified by theaudit. the changes should be tracked to ensure they occur andare effective and the closure of action items should bedocumented. in manycases, the best way to determine if theproblems have been solved is through a follow-up audit.iv. sqaauditschedulinga. routine schedulinginternal sqaaudits should be scheduled frequently enough toidentify potential problems so that no surprises develop forproject management. they should be scheduled routinely duringthe life cycle, particularly around life cycle phase transitions.the most effective internal audit programs schedule frequentaudits of small areas of project activity. frequent auditing,combined with other sqamonitoring activities, would assureproject managementhat the actual status of the project isknown, vis-a-vis standards, procedures, and schedules.external audits require more planning and interview time, but arescheduled muchless frequently. the most important time for anexternal sqaaudit is at the start of the implementation phase.this audit assures that the developer\\'s standards and proceduresare implemented in a mannerappropriate for the project and thatthey are being followed. a second important time in a project\\'slife cycle is the beginning of system integration. an externalaudit helps to assure that the software is ready for integration,that test plans and procedures are in place, and that proceduresfor control of the software are not short-circuited. projectsthat are in trouble or have no internal audit function shouldhave more frequent external audits.another factor to consider in the scheduling of audits, eitherinternal or external, is the results of previous audits. eachsqaaudit should include a review of the results and action itemsfrom any previous audits to confirm closure. if there were anumberof problems and action items, audits should be scheduledmore frequently. projects that follow their procedures, meettheir standards, and are accurate in reporting schedule andstatus need less frequent auditing.b. sqaaudits in responseto warning signssomeprojects mayshow indications of problems in the developmentprocess. whenwarning signs appear, the acquirer should considerconducting an external audit as part of its response. the samewarning signs can be used by the software provider to step up orevaluate the effectiveness of its internal audit program.the audit program should be intensified if the project exhibitsany of the following signs:frequent schedule/milestone changes.• inconsistency of the developer\\'s organizational structurewith original plans or apparent inconsistency with the structureor functionality of the products to be produced.• unexplained fluctuation of project staff level or under- orover-staffing comparedto estimates.• increases in the numberof tbditems and action itemswithout adequate progress in solutions.• the inability or unwillingness of the developer to provideadequate and accurate information on project status, schedules,and plans.• continual delay of scheduled software system capabilities tolater releases/versions.• unreasonable numbersof nonconformancesor change requests;for example, a large numberunresolved, or a sudden increase innumbers. an \"unreasonable number\" might be a suspiciously smallamount of nonconformancesfor a complex system.there maybe other indications that are apparent to projectmanagementin specific cases. an experienced project manager\\'sintuition that something maybe wrong is a warning sign thatshould be heeded. an external audit is a cost effective way foran acquirer to ascertain the real product status and realprocesses being used by a developer; developer managementshouldhave an ongoing audit program to assure that no surprises are instore for them.c. announcing auditsadequate notification of audits should be provided to thedevelopers for a numberof reasons. unannounced(surprise)audits are disruptive and demoralizing to the development staffand should be avoided. the intent of an audit program should beto help promote conformance with standards and procedures and thereporting of accurate status, not to \"catch in the act\" those\"guilty\" of violations. an announcedschedule of audits allowsproper preparation in terms of having required documentationavailable and being prepared to answer the auditor\\'s questions.v. sqaauditsduringthesoftwarelife cyclea. software concept and initiation phaseduring the concept and initiation phase, the software concept isdeveloped, the feasibility of the software system is evaluated,the acquisition strategy is developed, and, if a contract is tobe used to acquire the software, procurement is initiated and acontract is awarded. before selecting an organization to performa project, the acquiring organization can request a pre-award sqaaudit. the intent of this type of audit is slightly differentfrom audits performed later in the life cycle. since there areno activities underway on the software that is to be developed,the auditor can only review the provider\\'s \"corporate\" or genericstandards and procedures, and past projects. if possible, theseshould be examined in the context of the proposed project, sothat their effectiveness can be judged. this type of auditrequires an experienced auditor.the procedures and standards for the project are formulatedduring this phase. the sqa staff of the acquirer should ensurethat standards and procedures adopted are appropriate for theproject and are auditable, i.e., have a clear documentationtrail, with easy-to-follow steps. they also should make surethat the contract allows external audits and requires internalaudits.b. software requirements phaseduring the software requirements phase, the software concept andallocated system requirements are analyzed and documented assoftware requirements. test planning is begun, with a method forverifying each requirement identified and included in apreliminary test plan. risks are identified and risk managementcontrol mechanisms are established. the size and scope of theremainder of the project is reevaluated, and changes in resourcesand schedules are made. methods, standards, and procedures aredetailed and put in place. the phase ends with a requirementsreview, at which the requirements are agreed to between theacquirer and developer and put under cm.internal audits during this phase concentrate on the process ofdeveloping, documenting, and controlling the requirements. someprocess should be in place to control the requirements and draftdocuments as they are developed. this process probably will berelatively informal, and may include nrca and an action itemtracking system. there may be procedures for reporting onprogress, estimating system and project resources, and riskassessment. all of these can be audited to the extent thatcontrolled processes are in place. in addition to procedures,auditors should verify that requirements documents follow theformat specified in the documentation standard.an external audit, if one is performed during this phase, maylook at the same items that are covered by an internal audit.addition, an external audit can cover the same items as listedfor a pre-award audit.inc. software architectural design phasethe objective of the architectural design phase is to develop anoverall design for the software, allocating all of therequirements to software components. the software requirementsare controlled and managed, and documents baselined following therequirements phase are changed only by a formal process. thephase ends with the preliminary design review, during which theacquirer and developer agree on the architecture of the systemthat is to be produced. rework and action items resulting fromthe review are tracked and completed.internal and external audits during this phase should include thedesign documentation, verifying that format standards are met.the auditor should assure that all requirements are beingallocated to software components. it is especially important toaudit the configuration control mechanisms for the requirementsto make sure that unauthorized and uncontrolled requirementchange and growth is not occurring. in addition, items such asthose mentioned in the previous phase, i.e., status reporting,action item tracking, and nonconformance reporting should beaudited.d. software detailed design phaseduring the detailed design phase, the architectural design isexpanded to the unit level. interface control documents arecompleted and test plans revised. constraints and object systemresource limits are reestimated and analyzed, and staffing andtest resources are validated. the phase ends with the criticaldesign review, and the detailed design is baselined.audits during this phase should focus on the progress anddocumentation of the detailed design. if unit developmentfolders (or other similar documentation) are used, they should bestarted during this phase, and can be audited. as auditing isdone, reported status should be compared with the actual status.any discrepancies should be noted. both the requirements and thearchitectural design should be under cm and the cm process shouldbe audited. other items listed in the descriptions of theprevious phases are still applicable.e. software implementation phaseduring the implementation phase, the software is coded and unittested. all documentation is produced in quasi-final form,including internal code documentation. at the end of the phase,all required products should be ready for delivery, subject tomodification during integration and testing. audits during thisphase check the results of design and coding, cm activities andprogram library, nrca process, and schedule and status of theproject.internal audits should be frequent during this phase. theproject staff is usually at its maximum, and there are a greatnumber of simultaneous activities. sqa auditing is one of themore important ways for management to keep the process undercontrol, assure that quality products are being developed, andthat status is actually as reported. completed products arebeing sent to test as they are ready, and the products and theircontrol process should be audited. audits should include codeaudits to makesure coding standards are being followed and thatinternal code documentation standards are met. if inspections orsomeother form of peer reviews are done, the auditor shouldcheck that they are completed on all products and that actionitems resulting from them are carried out.an external audit is most effective if done early in theimplementation phase. at this point in the life cycle, allcontrol procedures are in operation and all standards are in use.this external sqaaudit assures that they are being followedcorrectly and that status is correctly reported. if any problemsare noted, it is early enough for meaningful change andcorrective action.m . software integration and test phasethe objectives of the integration and test phase are to integratethe software units into a completed system, discover and correctany nonconformances, and demonstrate that the system meets itsrequirements. the phase ending review is the test readinessreview, during which the developer provides to the acquirerevidence that the software system is ready for acceptancetesting. during this phase, the test plan is executed, thedocumentation is updated and completed, and the products arefinalized for delivery.during this phase, internal audits include any and all of theitems in previous phases. however, internal audits shouldconcentrate on assuring that product changes made to correctnonconformances discovered during the testing are controlled,completed, and documented. audits of the cm and nrca processes,and computer program library are highly important. the sqa auditshould include a check of the formal test procedures and the testresults. integration and test is often the most confusing andtime-pressured part of a project, and there is a tendency todiscard standards and procedures due to this pressure.external audits during this phase should concentrate on the sameitems as internal audits, with additional emphasis on assuringcompleteness; that is, that testing has not been shortchanged inorder to meet schedules.g. software acceptance and delivery phaseduring the acceptance and delivery phase, the formal acceptanceprocedure is carried out. as a minimum, there is a requirements-driven demonstration of the software to show that it meets thoserequirements. the process also may include acquirer tests, fieldusage, or other arrangements that are intended to assure that thesoftware will function correctly in its intended environment.this phase is very much like the end of the previous phase, withsystem tests being run, nonconformances noted, and correctionsbeing made to the software, documentation, and data bases. theitems to be audited are similar, especially the cm and nrcaprocesses.h. software sustaining engineering and operations phaseduring this phase of the software life cycle, the software isused to achieve the objectives for which it was acquired.corrections and modifications are madeto the software to sustainits operational capabilities and to upgrade its capacity tosupport its users. software changes mayrange in scope fromsimple corrective action up to major modifications that require afull life cycle process.internal audits should respond to the extent and type of changesbeing madeto the system. if there is only a low level ofcorrective action, then audits maybe limited to the cmand nrcaprocedures and to verifying that quality is being maintained inthe products. if substantial modifications are being made,however, then a full or mini-life cycle should be in place andaudits should be performed as described for the appropriatestage.whenlong term sustaining engineering is being performed, anexternal audit should be done periodically to assure the acquirerthat product quality is maintained and sustained. a minimumofone external audit per year is recommended;more if the level ofchange activity is high.vi. preparinga checklistan audit checklist is a list of items that the auditor intends toexamine and questions the auditor intends to ask during the sitevisit portion of the audit. while a generic checklist maybeused as a basis for all audits, better results will be achievedif the generic checklist is tailored for each audit. tailoringconsists of choosing appropriate items or questions from thegeneric checklist, expanding the level of detail, addingadditional questions and topics, and changing the wording of thequestions to fit the project\\'s nomenclature. information fortailoring maycomefrom the contract requirements, organizationalstandards and practices, and results and action items fromprevious audits. additional information to be considered fortailoring should include the structure of the developmentorganization and project, life cycle phase, and audit focus.in developing the checklist, the auditor should be careful not tooverlook important information that appears to be obvious. forexample, assuming the project has a product specification maybeerroneous; adding that item to the checklist will help to assurethat the information is confirmed.a sample generic checklist, divided by topic, is provided inappendix b. under each topic is a series of typical questionsthat should be addressed if that topic is going to be part of theaudit. to tailor this checklist, the auditor should determinewhich topics apply to the audit and whether questions should beanswered by interviews, examination of the software products anddocuments, examination of records, or a combination of methods.the auditor then should sort the questions by the method that isintended to be used to answer them, and further, by the precisesource to be used. for example, questions about how cmoperatesmight be asked of the cmmanagerduring an interview, but someofthose samequestions might be directed at the person who operatesthe project\\'s computer program library. answers to other cmquestions might be found through an examination of the records ofthe cmprocess; still others by an examination of code anddocumentation products.as muchas possible, questions should be phrased in terms of thespecific project and organization being audited, and should usethe namesand terms that the project uses. this tailoring willtake somework on the part of the auditor, but this effort willbe repaid by the fact that effective communication will beestablished earlier.the parts of the tailored checklist that will be answered by anexamination of records or products should be put on a form foruse on-site. the form can be simple, but should allow space foranswers to each question and additional comments. the formshould, if possible, allow the checking of boxes or simple entryof information.as the auditor proceeds with the site visit, the checklists andforms can be completed with the information obtained. theauditor must retain the flexibility to modify the forms orquestions as information is gathered. additional questions arelikely to be suggested by answers given, and forms maynot havebeen properly madein advance to record the real situation. itis important to rememberthat the checklist and forms derivedfrom it are guides, and that the objective of the audit is tounderstand and report on the actual state of affairs in thedeveloping organization.vii. auditingin theabsenceofstandardsandproceduresan auditor maybe asked to \"audit\" a project that lacksdocumentedstandards and procedures, perhaps because of warningsigns indicated in chapter iv. most often, this type of auditwill be external to the project, even if the auditor is employedby the developing organization, because a developer that does nothave documentedstandards and procedures is unlikely to have aninternal audit program.all projects generate code and documentation, but if there are nowritten standards, the products will be in the style of theindividual technical performers or their managers. all projectshandle changes and problems, and test their software. themethods maybe somewhatad-hoc and dependent on the specificindividuals involved in a specific case, but they do exist,documentedor not. the role of the auditor is to discover anddocument the \"standards\" and \"procedures\" that are actuallyfollowed.after the auditor has determined from interviews what \"standards\"and \"procedures\" are followed, the rest of the audit can proceedlike any other audit. that is, the auditor can follow theprogress of control paths and determine the extent to which theprocedures are followed versus the numberof exceptions that areallowed. the auditor can sample the products and rate theirconformance to the (unwritten) standards.the auditor must gather enough information to evaluate thesuitability and consistency of the unwritten standards andprocedures. the auditor maybe experienced enough to do theevaluation, or the auditor maywish to leave the evaluation tothe managemento which he/she will report. in either case, theauditor has to gather information on product quality, consistencyof application of the unwritten rules, the adequacy of testingand reviews, and instances of confusion and/or error that mayhave resulted from uncertainty. this information is then usedfor evaluation.viii. qualitiesofanauditorthe major contribution of an internal or external auditor toproject success is the collection and presentation of informationthat allows project managementa clear view of the product\\'sactual status and the actual compliance with standards andprocedures. this requires an impartial auditor. in particular,an internal auditor must rememberthat covering up problems, dueto feelings of empathy with the project staff or a desire topresent the developer\\'s organization in a good light, iscounterproductive. problems that are not brought to light willnot be solved, and mayresult in muchlarger problems later inthe life cycle.a good auditor should have a basic understanding of the softwaredevelopment life cycle and the products and processes involved ineach of its phases. if an auditor is expected to evaluate thestandards and procedures used by the developer and to judge theirimpact on product quality and project schedule, then he/she needssignificant experience and background in software development andsoftware management. it helps if the auditor is knowledgeableabout the type of software being audited, and is aware of thespecific software development procedures used in the project. itis useful if the auditor is experienced or trained in auditingtechniques.ix. techniquesandtoolsthe most frequently used tool for an sqaaudit is an auditchecklist. the checklist must be tailored to the project to beaudited, as it provides a list of questions that must be answeredabout that particular project.automated tools, either brought by the auditor or provided by theproject, maybe used if compatible with the project\\'s standardsand procedures. for example, the project mayhave a standardschecker for code. the auditor can run the checker on a sample ofthe code, or can verify that the project runs the checker.the checklist tailoring and form-making process also maybeassisted by keeping a generic checklist in a database or wordprocessor. the tailored information maythen be automaticallytransferred to a form or brought to the audit on a laptopcomputer.appendixa: sqaauditreportthe following is the minimumcontent for an

       "{'answer': '## RFID Implementation Strategy for Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG)\\n\\n**Problem Overview:**\\n\\nThe Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry faces persistent challenges related to inventory management, supply chain visibility, and operational efficiency. Traditional barcode systems, while functional, are limited in their capabilities. They require line-of-sight scanning, are prone to errors, and offer limited real-time data. This leads to stockouts, overstocking, increased labor costs, and reduced profitability. RFID technology presents a significant opportunity to address these issues, but its adoption has been hampered by cost concerns, lack of industry-wide standards, and consumer privacy anxieties.\\n\\n**Key Challenges:**\\n\\n* **Cost of Implementation:** RFID tags and readers are more expensive than barcodes, representing a significant upfront investment.\\n* **Lack of Standardization:** Absence of universal standards for tag formats, frequencies, and data protocols hinders interoperability.\\n* **Consumer Privacy Concerns:**  The potential for tracking consumer shopping habits raises privacy concerns and requires careful communication and transparency.\\n* **Industry-Wide Adoption:**  Successful implementation requires collaboration and adoption across the entire supply chain, from manufacturers to retailers.\\n* **Technical Integration:** Integrating RFID systems with existing ERP and inventory management systems can be complex.\\n* **Data Management & Analysis:**  The vast amount of data generated by RFID systems requires robust data management and analytical capabilities.\\n* **Return on Investment (ROI) Justification:** Demonstrating a clear and compelling ROI to justify the investment is crucial for gaining buy-in from stakeholders.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Strategic Recommendations:**\\n\\n1. **Phased Implementation:**  Avoid a \"big bang\" approach. Begin with pilot programs focusing on specific product categories or distribution centers.\\n2. **Tiered Tagging Strategy:**  Prioritize tagging at the pallet and case levels initially, with a gradual move towards item-level tagging as costs decrease and benefits are realized.\\n3. **Collaborative Partnerships:**  Forge partnerships with technology providers, industry peers, and standards organizations to share knowledge, reduce costs, and promote interoperability.\\n4. **Transparency and Communication:**  Proactively communicate with consumers about the benefits of RFID and address privacy concerns through clear policies and data anonymization techniques.\\n5. **Data-Driven Decision Making:**  Leverage RFID data to optimize inventory levels, improve forecasting accuracy, and identify areas for operational improvement.\\n6. **Focus on High-Value Products:** Prioritize RFID implementation for products with high theft rates, frequent stockouts, or significant profit margins.\\n7. **Develop a Robust Data Security Plan:** Implement strong security measures to protect RFID data from unauthorized access and cyber threats.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Implementation Plan:**\\n\\n| **Phase** | **Activities** | **Timeline** | **Key Metrics** |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| **Phase 1: Pilot Program (6-9 Months)** | Select pilot product category (e.g., high-theft items, seasonal goods). Implement RFID at pallet and case levels in a single distribution center. Train staff. | 6-9 Months | Inventory accuracy, stockout rates, labor costs, data transmission reliability. |\\n| **Phase 2: Expansion (12-18 Months)** | Expand RFID implementation to additional distribution centers and product categories. Begin exploring item-level tagging for select products. | 12-18 Months | Overall inventory accuracy, reduction in shrinkage, improved order fulfillment rates. |\\n| **Phase 3: Optimization & Integration (18-24 Months)** | Integrate RFID data with existing ERP and inventory management systems. Refine data analytics capabilities.  Evaluate item-level tagging feasibility. | 18-24 Months |  Supply chain visibility, forecasting accuracy, operational efficiency. |\\n| **Phase 4: Full-Scale Adoption (24+ Months)** |  Roll out RFID across the entire supply chain, including retail stores.  Continuously monitor and optimize RFID performance. | Ongoing |  Overall profitability, customer satisfaction, competitive advantage. |\\n\\n\\n\\n**Expected Outcomes:**\\n\\n* **Reduced Inventory Costs:** Optimized inventory levels, minimized waste, and improved storage efficiency.\\n* **Improved Supply Chain Visibility:** Real-time tracking of goods throughout the supply chain.\\n* **Reduced Stockouts:** Enhanced ability to meet customer demand and avoid lost sales.\\n* **Decreased Shrinkage:** Reduced theft and loss due to improved tracking and security.\\n* **Increased Operational Efficiency:** Streamlined processes, reduced labor costs, and improved productivity.\\n* **Enhanced Customer Satisfaction:**  Improved product availability and faster order fulfillment.\\n* **Competitive Advantage:**  Greater agility and responsiveness to market changes.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Appendices (Illustrative):**\\n\\n* **Table: Cost Comparison - Barcode vs. RFID**\\n\\n| Feature | Barcode | RFID |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| Tag Cost | $0.01 - $0.05 | $0.10 - $1.00 (decreasing) |\\n| Reader Cost | $50 - $500 | $500 - $5000+ |\\n| Scanning Range | Line-of-sight | Several feet |\\n| Data Capacity | Limited | Significantly higher |\\n| Read Speed | Slower | Faster |\\n\\n* **Data Privacy Policy Example (Simplified):**\\n\\n\"We are committed to protecting your privacy. RFID data is used solely for inventory management and supply chain optimization.  We do not track individual consumer shopping habits.  Data is anonymized and aggregated for reporting purposes.  We adhere to all applicable privacy regulations.\"\\n\\n**Note:** This plan is a framework and requires customization based on specific business needs, product characteristics, and market conditions. Continuous monitoring and adaptation are essential for maximizing the benefits of RFID implementation.'}"
