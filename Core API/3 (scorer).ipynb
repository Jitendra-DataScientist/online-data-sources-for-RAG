One of the products of this program is a series of guidebooks that define a NASA concept of the assurance processes that are used in software development. The Software Assurance Guidebook, NASA-GB-A201, issued in September, 1989, provides an overall picture of the NASA concepts and practices in software assurance. Second level guidebooks focus on specific activities that fall within the software assurance discipline, and provide more detailed information for the manager and/or practitioner.

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m Internal and external food safety audits are conducted to assess the safety and quality of food including on-farm production, manufacturing practices, sanitation, and hygiene. Some auditors are direct stakeholders that are employed by food establishments to conduct internal audits, while other auditors may represent the interests of a second party purchaser or a third-party auditing agency. Some buyers conduct their own audits or additional testing, while some buyers trust the results of third-party audits or inspections. Third-party auditors, however, use various food safety audit standards and most do not have a vested interest in the products being sold. Audits are conducted under a proprietary standard, while food safety inspections are generally conducted within a legal framework. There have been many foodborne illness outbreaks linked to food processors that have passed third-party audits and inspections, raising questions about the utility of both. Supporters argue third-party audits are a way to ensure food safety in an era of dwindling economic resources. Critics contend that while external audits and inspections can be a valuable tool to help ensure safe food, such activities represent only a snapshot in time. This paper identifies limitations of food safety inspections and audits and provides recommendations for strengthening the system, based on developing a strong food safety culture, including risk-based verification steps, throughout the food safety system\n",

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m Food safety technology can increase a company’s capacity to prevent a foodborne contamination. A food safety audit—a quality control tool in which an auditor observes whether a plant’s processing practices and technologies are compatible with good food safety practices—can indicate how effectively food safety technology is being used. Fast food restaurants, grocery stores, and other major customers of meat and poultry processing plants conduct their own audits or hire auditors to assess the soundness of a plant’s processing operation. Meat and poultry plants can also audit themselves as a way to help maintain process control. In this report, we document the extent of food safety audits in meat and poultry processing plants. We also examine the associations between the use of audits and plant size, firm structure, and food safety technology use. Results show that larger plants, plants subject to food safety audits, and plants that are part of a multiplant firm use more food safety technology than other plants. Plants subject to both plant-hired and customer-hired audits had greater technology use than single (plant- or customer-hired) audit plants.Meat and poultry processing, safety standards, product recalls, food safety technology, food safety audits, Agribusiness, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Industrial Organization, Livestock Production/Industries,\n",

Quality audit is a review and evaluation of all or part of a quality system with the specific purpose of improving it. It is one of the means to examine pharmacy programs and ensures that the procedures and reimbursement mechanisms comply with the contractual and regulatory requirements. A quality audit is usually conducted by external or independent experts or by a team designated by management for this purpose. These audits can be extended to suppliers and contractors as well. An audit will assess the strengths and weaknesses of quality assurance and quality assurance processes, the results of which assists in improving processes and building a better system for company benefits.

Lack of consumer and producer quality awareness is determined as the main problem by SWOT and Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) studies. A Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) study was conducted by interviewing local stakeholders. Turkish producers' knowledge is limited and their quality perception focuses mainly on food safety. There are barriers in exports due to quality that reduce the Turkish share in world food markets.

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m European food industries are responsible for the safety of the food products brought on the market. Therefore, a legal demanded food safety management system (FSMS) or self-checking system (SCS) is implemented in companies, often based on commercial quality assurance standards as ISO22000, BRC or IFS. The Belgian government provides the possibility for food business operators to have their SCS approved by means of audits conducted by either the competent food safety authority, FASFC, or by a commercial certification body,  recognised by the government. The audits are based on specifically developed guides for self-checking per sector, approved by the Belgian government. In view of evaluating the effect of the self-checking system certification on the performance of an implemented FSMS and the companies’ microbiological food safety output, this paper presents the results of an independent self-assessment conducted by eighty-two food business operators in Belgium. The study was conducted in spring/summer of 2010. The outcome of this study is discussed against national inspection results by the FASFC of the year 2009, 2010 and 2011 in Belgian food companies. The enforcement of a SCS by the Belgian government on the performance of a FSMS, their food safety output and their inspection results is less clear for food processing companies compared to the positive effect for the distribution sector. The majority of food processing companies were already certified for a voluntary system next to the legal demanded SCS. No significant difference could be identified between SCS certified and non-certified companies; large, medium or small scale companies and the sector in which they are working for food processing companies. Five clusters could be identified in the performance of a FSMS and microbiological food safety output. In overall Belgian processing companies are having a good performing FSMS and microbiological food safety output\n",

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m The institutional environment for food quality and safety in Turkey is rapidly changing in the last decade but there are still some inconsistencies compared with the EU. High costs of establishing quality assurance systems (QAS), inefficient capacity of the institutional frame, unknown consumer attitudes, low level of production techniques and lack of awareness of producers and consumers are important weaknesses, when evaluating the current food quality and safety situation in Turkey. Whereas, rapid development of QAS, increase in consumer demands, harmonisation of legislation with the EU, increase in the research and incentives for quality production, and production potentials were determined as strong points. When analysing the socio-economic situation of farms, producers’ knowledge, perception and interest in quality with Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA), it is found that producers did not accumulate capital because of the low profits, a handicap for expanding and investing into production and product quality. Moreover, the producers' knowledge is limited and their quality perception mainly focuses on food safety. As a result, academic studies and research projects needs to be extended and the adaptation of the Turkish legislation with the EU should be completed accordingly.Food Quality Governance, SMEs Barrier for Food Quality, Food Quality Assurance, Agricultural and Food Policy, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,\n",

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m Internal and external food safety audits are conducted to assess the safety and quality of food including on-farm production, manufacturing practices, sanitation, and hygiene. Some auditors are direct stakeholders that are employed by food establishments to conduct internal audits, while other auditors may represent the interests of a second party purchaser or a third-party auditing agency. Some buyers conduct their own audits or additional testing, while some buyers trust the results of third-party audits or inspections. Third-party auditors, however, use various food safety audit standards and most do not have a vested interest in the products being sold. Audits are conducted under a proprietary standard, while food safety inspections are generally conducted within a legal framework. There have been many foodborne illness outbreaks linked to food processors that have passed third-party audits and inspections, raising questions about the utility of both. Supporters argue third-party audits are a way to ensure food safety in an era of dwindling economic resources. Critics contend that while external audits and inspections can be a valuable tool to help ensure safe food, such activities represent only a snapshot in time. This paper identifies limitations of food safety inspections and audits and provides recommendations for strengthening the system, based on developing a strong food safety culture, including risk-based verification steps, throughout the food safety system\n",

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m Food safety technology can increase a company’s capacity to prevent a foodborne contamination. A food safety audit—a quality control tool in which an auditor observes whether a plant’s processing practices and technologies are compatible with good food safety practices—can indicate how effectively food safety technology is being used. Fast food restaurants, grocery stores, and other major customers of meat and poultry processing plants conduct their own audits or hire auditors to assess the soundness of a plant’s processing operation. Meat and poultry plants can also audit themselves as a way to help maintain process control. In this report, we document the extent of food safety audits in meat and poultry processing plants. We also examine the associations between the use of audits and plant size, firm structure, and food safety technology use. Results show that larger plants, plants subject to food safety audits, and plants that are part of a multiplant firm use more food safety technology than other plants. Plants subject to both plant-hired and customer-hired audits had greater technology use than single (plant- or customer-hired) audit plants.Meat and poultry processing, safety standards, product recalls, food safety technology, food safety audits, Agribusiness, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Industrial Organization, Livestock Production/Industries,\n",

Quality audit is a review and evaluation of all or part of a quality system with the specific purpose of improving it. It is one of the means to examine pharmacy programs and ensures that the procedures and reimbursement mechanisms comply with the contractual and regulatory requirements. A quality audit is usually conducted by external or independent experts or by a team designated by management for this purpose. These audits can be extended to suppliers and contractors as well. An audit will assess the strengths and weaknesses of quality assurance and quality assurance processes, the results of which assists in improving processes and building a better system for company benefits. This article focuses on various aspects of quality auditing in the pharmaceutical industry including its principles, objectives, importance and benefits and planning along with the deficiencies that are likely to occur during the process.

The governance structure of food quality assurance in Turkey is explained, which includes public, semi-public and private institutes, laws and legislations, policies and research.  Lack of consumer and producer quality awareness is determined as the main problem by SWOT and Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) studies. A Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) study was conducted by interviewing local stakeholders. Turkish producers' knowledge is limited and their quality perception focuses mainly on food safety. There are barriers in exports due to quality that reduce the Turkish share in world food markets. The study concludes with several recommendations on how problems in Turkish food quality assurance schemes could be effectively overcome.JRC.DDG.J.5-Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom\n",

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m European food industries are responsible for the safety of the food products brought on the market. Therefore, a legal demanded food safety management system (FSMS) or self-checking system (SCS) is implemented in companies, often based on commercial quality assurance standards as ISO22000, BRC or IFS. The Belgian government provides the possibility for food business operators to have their SCS approved by means of audits conducted by either the competent food safety authority, FASFC, or by a commercial certification body,  recognised by the government. The audits are based on specifically developed guides for self-checking per sector, approved by the Belgian government. In view of evaluating the effect of the self-checking system certification on the performance of an implemented FSMS and the companies’ microbiological food safety output, this paper presents the results of an independent self-assessment conducted by eighty-two food business operators in Belgium. The study was conducted in spring/summer of 2010. The outcome of this study is discussed against national inspection results by the FASFC of the year 2009, 2010 and 2011 in Belgian food companies. The enforcement of a SCS by the Belgian government on the performance of a FSMS, their food safety output and their inspection results is less clear for food processing companies compared to the positive effect for the distribution sector. The majority of food processing companies were already certified for a voluntary system next to the legal demanded SCS. No significant difference could be identified between SCS certified and non-certified companies; large, medium or small scale companies and the sector in which they are working for food processing companies. Five clusters could be identified in the performance of a FSMS and microbiological food safety output. In overall Belgian processing companies are having a good performing FSMS and microbiological food safety output\n",

      "\u001b[1;43mAbstract:\u001b[0m The institutional environment for food quality and safety in Turkey is rapidly changing in the last decade but there are still some inconsistencies compared with the EU. High costs of establishing quality assurance systems (QAS), inefficient capacity of the institutional frame, unknown consumer attitudes, low level of production techniques and lack of awareness of producers and consumers are important weaknesses, when evaluating the current food quality and safety situation in Turkey. Whereas, rapid development of QAS, increase in consumer demands, harmonisation of legislation with the EU, increase in the research and incentives for quality production, and production potentials were determined as strong points. When analysing the socio-economic situation of farms, producers’ knowledge, perception and interest in quality with Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA), it is found that producers did not accumulate capital because of the low profits, a handicap for expanding and investing into production and product quality. Moreover, the producers' knowledge is limited and their quality perception mainly focuses on food safety. As a result, academic studies and research projects needs to be extended and the adaptation of the Turkish legislation with the EU should be completed accordingly.Food Quality Governance, SMEs Barrier for Food Quality, Food Quality Assurance, Agricultural and Food Policy, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,\n",

One of the products of this program is a series of\\nguidebooks that define a NASA concept of the assurance processes\\nthat are used in software development.\\nThe Software Assurance Guidebook, NASA-GB-A201, issued in\\nSeptember, 1989, provides an overall picture of the NASA concepts\\nand practices in software assurance. Second level guidebooks\\nfocus on specific activities that fall within the software\\nassurance discipline, and provide more detailed information for\\nthe manager and/or practitioner.\\nThis is the second level Software Quality Assurance Audits\\nGuidebook that describes software quality assurance audits in a\\nway that is compatible with practices at NASA Centers. For a\\nmore generalized view of how software quality assurance audits\\nrelate to Software Assurance, refer to the Software Assurance\\nGuidebook, document number NASA-GB-A201.\\nI. GENERAL\\nThe NASA Software Assurance Guidebook classifies the software\\nquality assurance (SQA) audit as a fundamental quality assurance\\ntechnique. It is the intent of this guidebook to further define\\naudits, describe the audit process, and provide a sample\\nchecklist that can be tailored for use in an audit. The\\nguidebook is written for quality assurance practitioners who will\\nperform audits, software developers who will be audited, and for\\nsoftware project managers and acquirers who have to decide the\\nextent of auditing to be done.\\nhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19980228457 2020-06-15T23:30:49+00:00Z\\nIn this guidebook, the term \\\"audit\\\" specifically refers to an SQA\\ntechnique that is used to examine the conformance of a\\ndevelopment process to procedures and the conformance of products\\nto standards. An SQAaudit also can examine the conformance of\\nthe actual status of the development activity to the reported\\nstatus. The term \\\"audit\\\" is used to describe a numberof\\nadditional software activities; however, due to their different\\npurpose and focus, they are not addressed in this guidebook. For\\nexample, the Functional Configuration Audit (FCA)and Physical\\nConfiguration Audit (PCA)are configuration management(CM)\\nactivities. Quality (Engineering) Audits and Safety Audits are\\ntechnical activities that evaluate a software product against\\nQuality Engineering and Safety requirements. These types of\\naudits are not covered in this guidebook.\\nII. CONCEPTSANDDEFINITIONS\\nAn SQAaudit is an activity that is performed to determine the\\nadherence to, and adequacy of, a project's established software\\ndevelopment standards and procedures and the effectiveness of\\ntheir implementation. As used in this guidebook, the main\\nobjective of an SQAaudit is to determine the adherence to\\nestablished standards and procedures; checking their adequacy or\\neffectiveness is a secondary objective that usually is not\\nrequested of an auditor.\\nIn the NASASoftware Assurance Guidebook, standards are defined\\nas \\\"the established criteria to which software products are\\ncompared.\\\" Software standards include documentation standards,\\ndesign standards, and coding standards. In that guidebook,\\nprocedures are defined as the \\\"established criteria to which the\\ndevelopment and control processes are compared.\\\" Procedures,\\nthen, are the step-by-step directions that are to be followed to\\naccomplish somedevelopment or control process; for example, CM\\nor nonconformancereporting and corrective action (NRCA). In\\nother words, standards and procedures are requirements for\\nsoftware management,engineering, and assurance; SQAaudits\\nverify their existence and assess a project's compliance with\\nthem.\\nSQAaudits also can comparethe actual status of a product with\\nreported status. Status auditing is most effective if there are\\nobjective and consistent criteria for evaluating the level of\\nproduct completeness. For example, Unit DevelopmentFolders\\n(UDFs)have a cover sheet for recording the progress of a unit\\nthrough its development stages; the folder contains the actual\\nproduct. If a project uses UDFs, then an audit can comparethe\\nactual product to the cover sheet and to the progress report.\\nThe actual processes and products examined by an audit will vary\\ndepending on the objective of the audit. The objective of the\\naudit can vary, and is determined by the organization that called\\nfor the audit. A general audit provides a comprehensive\\noverview, while a limited audit might be an examination of\\ncertain procedures, such as CM, or a check on a certain\\nrequirement, such as \\\"Are coding standards being followed?\\\"\\nAn audit maybe described as internal or external, depending on\\nthe organization of origin of the auditor(s). An internal audit\\nis an audit conducted by the SQAstaff of the software developer.\\nInternal audits are intended to be preventative in nature; to\\ndetect problems before they becomemajor.\\nAn external audit is one performed by an independent auditor who\\nis outside of the developing organization. External audits are\\nmost often requested by the acquiring organization, as a meansof\\nobtaining an independent opinion about the work in progress.\\nExternal audits tend to be more comprehensive in nature than\\ninternal audits, and usually encompassa broad area of the\\ndevelopment activity. Such audits usually are requested because\\nthe acquirer is uncertain of the effectiveness of the internal\\nprogram or because of lack of information and fears about the\\nquality of performance on the part of the developer. An\\nadvantage of an external audit is that the auditor maybe more\\nobjective about a project than an internal auditor; however, an\\nexternal auditor must spend more time learning about the project\\nand its development process.\\nIII. CONDUCTINGANSQAAUDIT\\nAn SQAaudit has four phases: planning and preparation, the site\\nvisit, reporting, and follow-up. During the planning and\\npreparation phase, the auditor gains an understanding of the\\nproject. Based on the scope of the audit, the auditor determines\\nthe specific questions that need to be answered, as well as the\\npersons to be interviewed and the records and products to be\\nexamined to answer the questions. The interviews are conducted,\\nand records and products are examined during the site visit. The\\nreporting phase consists of the exit debriefing of the audited\\nproject, the preparation of a written report on the audit, and\\nclarifying issues and providing related information as needed.\\nFollow-up is done by the project, as the problems and\\ndeficiencies found in the audit are remedied. Follow-up may\\ninclude reauditing to assess the adequacy of the remedies.\\nThe activities conducted during the phases vary depending on the\\nlife cycle phase of the project being audited and the scope of\\nthe audit. The activities also vary depending on whether the\\naudit is external or internal; an external audit requires more\\nextensive preparation and should examine a more comprehensive\\nsample of material than an internal audit.\\nEach of the four phases of an audit is described in the following\\nsections. The activities of each phase are described as if a\\ngeneral, external audit is to be done since this results in the\\ngreatest detail. Someof the activities maybe superfluous to an\\ninternal SQAaudit and maybe omitted.\\nA. Audit Planning and Preparation\\nA general SQAaudit should be planned carefully to examine all of\\nthe software engineering, management,and assurance processes and\\nall of their products. Software managementprocesses include\\nstatus reporting and CM. Engineering processes include analysis,\\ndesign, and code. Assurance processes include verification and\\nvalidation (V&V)and NRCA. Products include documentsand code.\\nIf the scope of the audit is more limited, then planning will be\\nwithin the defined limits. A limited audit might examine only\\none of the processes or a limited set of products. Activities\\nduring the planning and preparation phase are similar for all\\naudits, but preparation for a limited audit is focused on the\\nidentified process or product.\\nAs a first step, the auditor should understand the objective of\\nthe software development project and what products are to be\\nproduced. The auditor needs to know what the contract requires\\nin the way of deliverable software and documentation, and what,\\nif any, requirements exist for management,engineering, and\\nassurance practices. Onesource of this information maybe the\\nstatement of work and other contract documents. Onceit is clear\\nwhat is being developed and what the contract requires, the\\nauditor should review managementdocumentation, such as the\\nsoftware management,development, and assurance plans to\\nunderstand the processes that will be used to develop and control\\nthe products. Then the developer's standards and procedures\\nmanual should be reviewed to determine the quality standards and\\nthe detailed procedures planned to be applied to the software and\\nthe development process. From this background information, the\\nauditor should be able to understand the developer's software\\ndevelopment process.\\nThe auditor also should review somerecent status reports from\\nthe developer. These reports will furnish information on the\\nstage of completeness of products and maycontain information as\\nto problem areas.\\nAfter background familiarization and a look at project status,\\nthe auditor should define the areas that will require the most\\ncareful and detailed attention, i.e., the processes or products\\nthat seemto be in somedifficulty or whosestatus is in doubt.\\nThese areas maybe identified by the status reports, discussions\\nwith the acquirer of the software (if it is the acquirer who has\\nrequested the audit), review of nonconformancereports, and the\\nresults of previous audits.\\nOncethe auditor understands the project and has identified the\\nareas of concentration, he/she should develop a checklist. A\\nchecklist is a list of items to be examined and questions to be\\nasked. Each checklist should be tailored for the specific\\nproject being audited and its life cycle phase and should reflect\\nthe scope of the audit. A more comprehensive and less detailed\\nchecklist is required for a general audit; a limited audit\\nrequires a checklist that is more detailed in specific areas.\\nGuidance on preparing a checklist is given in Chapter VI. A\\nchecklist is intended to provide the auditor with a \\\"road map\\\"\\nduring the site visit. It must be complete, so that the auditor\\ncan know that sufficient information has been gathered if all of\\nthe checklist items are completed. The checklist questions help\\ndefine the individuals with whomthe auditor wishes an interview\\nand the types of records that the auditor will examine.\\nThe auditor should schedule the site visit to the project through\\nits assurance staff or other suitable contact after the\\npreparation is done and the checklist prepared. During this\\ncontact with the project, the auditor should specify the intent\\nof the audit, the records to be examined, and which people the\\nauditor wishes to interview. People to be interviewed will\\ninclude managers, selected developers, CMstaff, assurance staff,\\nand testers. Copies of the checklist maybe furnished to\\nincrease the project's understanding. The project should be\\nprepared to provide the auditor with a convenient working area\\nthat includes normal office facilities, access to all products\\nand records, and interviews with the identified individuals.\\nB. The Site Visit\\nThe purpose of the audit site visit is to collect the data\\nnecessary to assess that the required products are being\\nproduced, the degree to which they conform to applicable\\nstandards, how well procedures are being followed, and that the\\nreported status corresponds to the actual status. The audit is\\nintended to uncover any significant deviation from standards,\\nprocedures, or reported status so that corrective action can be\\ntaken. The auditor uses two basic techniques: interviews with\\nproject staff and examination of documentation and records.\\nThe site visit should begin with an entrance briefing, involving\\nthe auditor and key project staff. During this briefing, the\\nauditor should describe the focus of the audit, and identify the\\ninterviews to be conducted and the records to be examined. The\\nentrance briefing mayalso be used by the project to brief the\\nauditor on its processes, key staff members,and current status.\\nTime for questions and answers should be included. The auditor\\nalso should assure the project that an exit interview will be\\nheld where the auditor will present preliminary findings to the\\nproject and the project mayprovide any additional information to\\nthe auditor. This preliminary exchange of information can\\nsignificantly help to allay the fears of the project and to\\nsmooth the course of the site visit.\\nAfter the entrance briefing, the auditor should proceed with the\\ngathering of information. It is useful to begin the information\\ngathering process with interviews, during which the auditor tries\\nto understand the realities behind the documentedplans and\\nprocedures. The auditor should learn which individuals carry out\\na procedure, approve a change or fix, keep project records, etc.\\nEach individual should be asked to describe his/her perceptions\\nof and interactions with the process. The auditor should take\\nnotes, annotate or develop procedural flow diagrams, ask\\nquestions to clarify, and makeit his/her objective to clearly\\nunderstand the process. In particular, the auditor should be\\nalert for indications of shortcuts or abbreviations to the\\nprocedure. During interviews, the auditor must rememberthat\\ndata are being gathered, and that conclusions should wait until\\nall of the facts are in. This provides a clearer understanding\\nof the actual processes used on the project and eases\\ncommunications with the staff. The checklist developed during\\nthe preparation phase is used to guide the discussions during the\\ninterview.\\nOncethe auditor is sure that the processes and procedures are\\nunderstood as they really exist, he/she should begin examining\\nthe tangible parts of the project: its products and records.\\nProducts consist of requirements and design documentation,\\nincluding unit development folders, user manuals, code, etc.\\nRecords consist of memorandaand forms that document the events\\nin the life of a product. They comefrom CM, NRCA,and V&V,\\namongothers.\\ni. Records Examination\\nThe auditor examines records to see if a procedure is being\\ncorrectly followed. Record examination is described below in\\nterms of the principal processes that SQAaudits examine: CM,\\nNRCA,and V&V. Similar activities would be used in the\\nexamination of other sets of records.\\n\\u2022 CMAudit\\nDuring an audit of CM, the auditor should look at the complete\\nchange control cycle, beginning with the initial processing of a\\nchange request; through analysis of impact and dispositioning;\\ndesign, code, and testing; updating of documentation; submission\\nof the modified products to the library; and closure of the\\nchange request. Records to be examined include the change\\nrequests as processed by the ChangeControl Board, the work\\nauthorizing documents issued as a result of approved changes, the\\ncode and documentation products that are intended to reflect the\\napproved changes, and the program library records that capture\\nthe changes to code and data. Throughout the audit, the auditor\\nshould be alert for and documentany evidence of unauthorized\\nchanges.\\nThe records should show the authorization of each change, the\\nproduct(s) to be changed, and the version numbersof the changed\\nproduct. Muchof the auditor's attention should be devoted to\\nthe Program Library or equivalent, since this is where the\\nvarious versions of products and the change documentscontrolling\\nthose versions are stored. The auditor should check the products\\nin the library to ensure that documentation is up-to-date with\\ncode changes. The auditor should check the version numbering and\\nidentification schemes, and the control documents. The records\\nshould demonstrate that there are adequate security measures in\\nplace to prevent loss and unauthorized changes. The auditor\\nshould verify that every item of code and documentation in the\\nprogram library was properly received.\\n\\u2022 NRCAAudit\\nWhenauditing the NRCAsystem, the auditor should look at the\\ncomplete cycle. The auditor should review the nonconformance\\nreports that are filed, to assure that they are completely and\\ncorrectly filled out. The disposition process and board actions\\nshould be recorded, usually on the sameform. The\\nnonconformancesthat result in product changes should be tracked\\nto the product, and evidence should be gathered that changes are\\nmade, tested or reviewed, and approvals for issuance are granted.\\nThe NRCAprocedures will parallel those used in CM, and can be\\naudited in muchthe sameway, especially whenit comesto the\\nprogram library. In both cases (CMand NRCA),the auditor should\\npay particular attention to corrected products to assure that\\nthey still satisfy requirements and standards.\\n\\u2022 V&VAudit\\nAn audit of V&Vprocedures should include a check of the\\nverification matrix or equivalent, to assure that every\\nrequirement has a test and every test checks a requirement. Test\\nplans should be adequate, specifying the test environment, test\\nprocedures, and the expected results for each test. Test\\nprocedures should be clear and detailed. Test plans and\\nprocedures should be reviewed and approved.\\nThe auditor should verify from SQArecords that test procedures\\nwere followed and that all nonconformancesobserved during\\ntesting are recorded in the NRCAsystem. In addition to testing,\\nthe auditor should assess other methods of V&V, if used. For\\nexample, if inspections or another form of peer reviews are used\\nto find problems, the auditor should verify that the records of\\nthe review show that they were done and that corrections and\\nchanges agreed to in the review are madein the product.\\n2. Product Examination\\nThe intent of examination of products is two-fold: to see if\\nstandards are being followed, and to see if status is accurately\\nreported. Documentsare measuredagainst documentation\\nrequirements to makesure that all required documentsexist, and\\nagainst documentation standards to ensure that they have the\\ncorrect content and style. The auditor must read enough of the\\ndocumentsto form an opinion on the above; that is, the auditor\\nmust be able to determine that a documentpresented as showing\\nthe design indeed contains design information. On the other\\nhand, the auditor is not responsible for the technical\\ncorrectness of the documentsand should not spend time trying to\\nascertain if the documentsare correct.\\nCodealso is examined to determine if it meets standards. Code\\nstandards are likely to include rules for internal documentation,\\nsize of modules, styling formats, and other such items that the\\nauditor can verify. Rules for coding constructs or variable\\nnaming conventions are more difficult to verify. If the project\\nhas a code standards checker, the auditor mayrun it on some\\ncode. If the standards checker is to be run at a certain step in\\nthe development process, or if peer reviews are used to verify\\ncoding standards, the auditor must have access to those records.\\nProducts also are examined to comparetheir status with that\\nreported. Documentsreported as complete, for example, should\\ncontain all of the sections given in the table of contents (which\\nmaybe prescribed by a documentation standard), should be signed\\nby the approving authorities, and should contain few, if any, To-\\nBe-Determined (TBDs)items. Codeimplementation usually goes\\nthrough the steps of detailed design, code, peer review, and unit\\ntest. A module that is reported as complete should have gone\\nthrough all of the above steps, should meet the coding standards,\\nand should have whatever approvals are required. The Unit\\nDevelopmentFolder or equivalent should contain all of the\\nevidence to look at status of coding.\\n3. Sampling\\nDuring the process of checking records and products, the auditor\\nusually cannot examine each and every item; therefore, some\\nsampling process must be used. The auditor must decide on sample\\nsizes that can be accommodatedin the site visit. The sample\\nsizes must be balanced between completeness of coverage (some\\nitems from each product or set of records) and depth of coverage(numberof items from a specific product or set of records) . If\\nthe focus of the audit is limited, the sample size can be larger\\nfor the specific product or processes that are to be covered. In\\ndeciding on sample sizes, the auditor must allow time to follow\\nup in more depth in areas where the initial sample indicates\\nproblems. The specific products or records to be included in the\\nsample should be chosen by some\\\"randomizing\\\" method, and the\\nproject staff should not be informed in advance which items will\\nbe examined and which will not.\\nC. Audit Reporting\\nOncethe interviews and record examination have been completed,\\ninitial results should be shared with the staff of the audited\\nproject during an exit interview. The exit interview provides an\\nopportunity to clear up misunderstandings and allows project\\nstaff to present any information that they feel the auditor\\nfailed to consider. In addition, project staff learn immediately\\nabout the problems that have been found and can begin making\\nplans to correct them.\\nAfter adjusting the initial results to reflect the information\\ngathered in the exit interview, the auditor prepares a written\\nfinal report. The report should be organized to highlight the\\nmost significant results, addressing both problems and\\ncommendations, and should include a general narrative of the\\naudit. An example table of contents for an audit report is shown\\nin Appendix A. The audit report should be addressed to the\\nmanagementofficial who arranged for the audit, if the audit is\\nexternal; or directed as required by procedures, if internal.\\nThe objective of the audit report is to present a clear picture\\nof the status of a development activity or a facet of the\\nactivity to project management. The report must be clear,\\nobjective, and factual. In somecases, the auditor will find\\nthat, while procedures are being followed or standards are being\\nmet, the procedures or standards are not effective in producing a\\nquality product. It is the responsibility of the auditor to note\\nthe specific problems caused by the procedure and/or standard and\\ninclude them in the report. In general, however, problems that\\nthe auditor identifies should be related to project or\\ncontractually-required procedures and standards; the auditor's\\nopinion of their desirability should not affect his/her\\nevaluation of the adherence to them.\\nD. Follow-up\\nWhile the auditor's role is essentially finished after producing\\nthe audit report, actions to resolve deficiencies identified in\\nthat report must be taken by project management. Problems that\\nare feasible and reasonable to correct should be converted to\\naction items and assigned to appropriate individuals. A\\nrationale should be developed for those that are not to be\\ncorrected. It is the responsibility of the developers to improve\\ntheir processes in response to deficiencies identified by the\\naudit. The changes should be tracked to ensure they occur and\\nare effective and the closure of action items should be\\ndocumented. In manycases, the best way to determine if the\\nproblems have been solved is through a follow-up audit.\\nIV. SQAAUDITSCHEDULING\\nA. Routine Scheduling\\nInternal SQAaudits should be scheduled frequently enough to\\nidentify potential problems so that no surprises develop for\\nproject management. They should be scheduled routinely during\\nthe life cycle, particularly around life cycle phase transitions.\\nThe most effective internal audit programs schedule frequent\\naudits of small areas of project activity. Frequent auditing,\\ncombined with other SQAmonitoring activities, would assure\\nproject managementhat the actual status of the project is\\nknown, vis-a-vis standards, procedures, and schedules.\\nExternal audits require more planning and interview time, but are\\nscheduled muchless frequently. The most important time for an\\nexternal SQAaudit is at the start of the implementation phase.\\nThis audit assures that the developer's standards and procedures\\nare implemented in a mannerappropriate for the project and that\\nthey are being followed. A second important time in a project's\\nlife cycle is the beginning of system integration. An external\\naudit helps to assure that the software is ready for integration,\\nthat test plans and procedures are in place, and that procedures\\nfor control of the software are not short-circuited. Projects\\nthat are in trouble or have no internal audit function should\\nhave more frequent external audits.\\nAnother factor to consider in the scheduling of audits, either\\ninternal or external, is the results of previous audits. Each\\nSQAaudit should include a review of the results and action items\\nfrom any previous audits to confirm closure. If there were a\\nnumberof problems and action items, audits should be scheduled\\nmore frequently. Projects that follow their procedures, meet\\ntheir standards, and are accurate in reporting schedule and\\nstatus need less frequent auditing.\\nB. SQAAudits in Responseto Warning Signs\\nSomeprojects mayshow indications of problems in the development\\nprocess. Whenwarning signs appear, the acquirer should consider\\nconducting an external audit as part of its response. The same\\nwarning signs can be used by the software provider to step up or\\nevaluate the effectiveness of its internal audit program.\\nThe audit program should be intensified if the project exhibits\\nany of the following signs:\\nFrequent schedule/milestone changes.\\n\\u2022 Inconsistency of the developer's organizational structure\\nwith original plans or apparent inconsistency with the structure\\nor functionality of the products to be produced.\\n\\u2022 Unexplained fluctuation of project staff level or under- or\\nover-staffing comparedto estimates.\\n\\u2022 Increases in the numberof TBDitems and action items\\nwithout adequate progress in solutions.\\n\\u2022 The inability or unwillingness of the developer to provide\\nadequate and accurate information on project status, schedules,\\nand plans.\\n\\u2022 Continual delay of scheduled software system capabilities to\\nlater releases/versions.\\n\\u2022 Unreasonable numbersof nonconformancesor change requests;\\nfor example, a large numberunresolved, or a sudden increase in\\nnumbers. An \\\"unreasonable number\\\" might be a suspiciously small\\namount of nonconformancesfor a complex system.\\nThere maybe other indications that are apparent to project\\nmanagementin specific cases. An experienced project manager's\\nintuition that something maybe wrong is a warning sign that\\nshould be heeded. An external audit is a cost effective way for\\nan acquirer to ascertain the real product status and real\\nprocesses being used by a developer; developer managementshould\\nhave an ongoing audit program to assure that no surprises are in\\nstore for them.\\nC. Announcing Audits\\nAdequate notification of audits should be provided to the\\ndevelopers for a numberof reasons. Unannounced(surprise)\\naudits are disruptive and demoralizing to the development staff\\nand should be avoided. The intent of an audit program should be\\nto help promote conformance with standards and procedures and the\\nreporting of accurate status, not to \\\"catch in the act\\\" those\\n\\\"guilty\\\" of violations. An announcedschedule of audits allows\\nproper preparation in terms of having required documentation\\navailable and being prepared to answer the auditor's questions.\\nV. SQAAUDITSDURINGTHESOFTWARELIFE CYCLE\\nA. Software Concept and Initiation Phase\\nDuring the concept and initiation phase, the software concept is\\ndeveloped, the feasibility of the software system is evaluated,\\nthe acquisition strategy is developed, and, if a contract is to\\nbe used to acquire the software, procurement is initiated and a\\ncontract is awarded. Before selecting an organization to perform\\na project, the acquiring organization can request a pre-award SQA\\naudit. The intent of this type of audit is slightly different\\nfrom audits performed later in the life cycle. Since there are\\nno activities underway on the software that is to be developed,\\nthe auditor can only review the provider's \\\"corporate\\\" or generic\\nstandards and procedures, and past projects. If possible, these\\nshould be examined in the context of the proposed project, so\\nthat their effectiveness can be judged. This type of audit\\nrequires an experienced auditor.\\nThe procedures and standards for the project are formulated\\nduring this phase. The SQA staff of the acquirer should ensure\\nthat standards and procedures adopted are appropriate for the\\nproject and are auditable, i.e., have a clear documentation\\ntrail, with easy-to-follow steps. They also should make sure\\nthat the contract allows external audits and requires internal\\naudits.\\nB. Software Requirements Phase\\nDuring the software requirements phase, the software concept and\\nallocated system requirements are analyzed and documented as\\nsoftware requirements. Test planning is begun, with a method for\\nverifying each requirement identified and included in a\\npreliminary test plan. Risks are identified and risk management\\ncontrol mechanisms are established. The size and scope of the\\nremainder of the project is reevaluated, and changes in resources\\nand schedules are made. Methods, standards, and procedures are\\ndetailed and put in place. The phase ends with a requirements\\nreview, at which the requirements are agreed to between the\\nacquirer and developer and put under CM.\\nInternal audits during this phase concentrate on the process of\\ndeveloping, documenting, and controlling the requirements. Some\\nprocess should be in place to control the requirements and draft\\ndocuments as they are developed. This process probably will be\\nrelatively informal, and may include NRCA and an action item\\ntracking system. There may be procedures for reporting on\\nprogress, estimating system and project resources, and risk\\nassessment. All of these can be audited to the extent that\\ncontrolled processes are in place. In addition to procedures,\\nauditors should verify that requirements documents follow the\\nformat specified in the documentation standard.\\nAn external audit, if one is performed during this phase, may\\nlook at the same items that are covered by an internal audit.\\naddition, an external audit can cover the same items as listed\\nfor a pre-award audit.\\nIn\\nC. Software Architectural Design Phase\\nThe objective of the architectural design phase is to develop an\\noverall design for the software, allocating all of the\\nrequirements to software components. The software requirements\\nare controlled and managed, and documents baselined following the\\nrequirements phase are changed only by a formal process. The\\nphase ends with the preliminary design review, during which the\\nacquirer and developer agree on the architecture of the system\\nthat is to be produced. Rework and action items resulting from\\nthe review are tracked and completed.\\nInternal and external audits during this phase should include the\\ndesign documentation, verifying that format standards are met.\\nThe auditor should assure that all requirements are being\\nallocated to software components. It is especially important to\\naudit the configuration control mechanisms for the requirements\\nto make sure that unauthorized and uncontrolled requirement\\nchange and growth is not occurring. In addition, items such as\\nthose mentioned in the previous phase, i.e., status reporting,\\naction item tracking, and nonconformance reporting should be\\naudited.\\nD. Software Detailed Design Phase\\nDuring the detailed design phase, the architectural design is\\nexpanded to the unit level. Interface control documents are\\ncompleted and test plans revised. Constraints and object system\\nresource limits are reestimated and analyzed, and staffing and\\ntest resources are validated. The phase ends with the critical\\ndesign review, and the detailed design is baselined.\\nAudits during this phase should focus on the progress and\\ndocumentation of the detailed design. If unit development\\nfolders (or other similar documentation) are used, they should be\\nstarted during this phase, and can be audited. As auditing is\\ndone, reported status should be compared with the actual status.\\nAny discrepancies should be noted. Both the requirements and the\\narchitectural design should be under CM and the CM process should\\nbe audited. Other items listed in the descriptions of the\\nprevious phases are still applicable.\\nE. Software Implementation Phase\\nDuring the implementation phase, the software is coded and unit\\ntested. All documentation is produced in quasi-final form,\\nincluding internal code documentation. At the end of the phase,\\nall required products should be ready for delivery, subject to\\nmodification during integration and testing. Audits during this\\nphase check the results of design and coding, CM activities and\\nprogram library, NRCA process, and schedule and status of the\\nproject.\\nInternal audits should be frequent during this phase. The\\nproject staff is usually at its maximum, and there are a great\\nnumber of simultaneous activities. SQA auditing is one of the\\nmore important ways for management to keep the process under\\ncontrol, assure that quality products are being developed, and\\nthat status is actually as reported. Completed products are\\nbeing sent to test as they are ready, and the products and their\\ncontrol process should be audited. Audits should include code\\naudits to makesure coding standards are being followed and that\\ninternal code documentation standards are met. If inspections or\\nsomeother form of peer reviews are done, the auditor should\\ncheck that they are completed on all products and that action\\nitems resulting from them are carried out.\\nAn external audit is most effective if done early in the\\nimplementation phase. At this point in the life cycle, all\\ncontrol procedures are in operation and all standards are in use.\\nThis external SQAaudit assures that they are being followed\\ncorrectly and that status is correctly reported. If any problems\\nare noted, it is early enough for meaningful change and\\ncorrective action.\\nm . Software Integration and Test Phase\\nThe objectives of the integration and test phase are to integrate\\nthe software units into a completed system, discover and correct\\nany nonconformances, and demonstrate that the system meets its\\nrequirements. The phase ending review is the test readiness\\nreview, during which the developer provides to the acquirer\\nevidence that the software system is ready for acceptance\\ntesting. During this phase, the test plan is executed, the\\ndocumentation is updated and completed, and the products are\\nfinalized for delivery.\\nDuring this phase, internal audits include any and all of the\\nitems in previous phases. However, internal audits should\\nconcentrate on assuring that product changes made to correct\\nnonconformances discovered during the testing are controlled,\\ncompleted, and documented. Audits of the CM and NRCA processes,\\nand computer program library are highly important. The SQA audit\\nshould include a check of the formal test procedures and the test\\nresults. Integration and test is often the most confusing and\\ntime-pressured part of a project, and there is a tendency to\\ndiscard standards and procedures due to this pressure.\\nExternal audits during this phase should concentrate on the same\\nitems as internal audits, with additional emphasis on assuring\\ncompleteness; that is, that testing has not been shortchanged in\\norder to meet schedules.\\nG. Software Acceptance and Delivery Phase\\nDuring the acceptance and delivery phase, the formal acceptance\\nprocedure is carried out. As a minimum, there is a requirements-\\ndriven demonstration of the software to show that it meets those\\nrequirements. The process also may include acquirer tests, field\\nusage, or other arrangements that are intended to assure that the\\nsoftware will function correctly in its intended environment.\\nThis phase is very much like the end of the previous phase, with\\nsystem tests being run, nonconformances noted, and corrections\\nbeing made to the software, documentation, and data bases. The\\nitems to be audited are similar, especially the CM and NRCA\\nprocesses.\\nH. Software Sustaining Engineering and Operations Phase\\nDuring this phase of the software life cycle, the software is\\nused to achieve the objectives for which it was acquired.\\nCorrections and modifications are madeto the software to sustain\\nits operational capabilities and to upgrade its capacity to\\nsupport its users. Software changes mayrange in scope from\\nsimple corrective action up to major modifications that require a\\nfull life cycle process.\\nInternal audits should respond to the extent and type of changes\\nbeing madeto the system. If there is only a low level of\\ncorrective action, then audits maybe limited to the CMand NRCA\\nprocedures and to verifying that quality is being maintained in\\nthe products. If substantial modifications are being made,\\nhowever, then a full or mini-life cycle should be in place and\\naudits should be performed as described for the appropriate\\nstage.\\nWhenlong term sustaining engineering is being performed, an\\nexternal audit should be done periodically to assure the acquirer\\nthat product quality is maintained and sustained. A minimumof\\none external audit per year is recommended;more if the level of\\nchange activity is high.\\nVI. PREPARINGA CHECKLIST\\nAn audit checklist is a list of items that the auditor intends to\\nexamine and questions the auditor intends to ask during the site\\nvisit portion of the audit. While a generic checklist maybe\\nused as a basis for all audits, better results will be achieved\\nif the generic checklist is tailored for each audit. Tailoring\\nconsists of choosing appropriate items or questions from the\\ngeneric checklist, expanding the level of detail, adding\\nadditional questions and topics, and changing the wording of the\\nquestions to fit the project's nomenclature. Information for\\ntailoring maycomefrom the contract requirements, organizational\\nstandards and practices, and results and action items from\\nprevious audits. Additional information to be considered for\\ntailoring should include the structure of the development\\norganization and project, life cycle phase, and audit focus.\\nIn developing the checklist, the auditor should be careful not to\\noverlook important information that appears to be obvious. For\\nexample, assuming the project has a product specification maybe\\nerroneous; adding that item to the checklist will help to assure\\nthat the information is confirmed.\\nA sample generic checklist, divided by topic, is provided in\\nAppendix B. Under each topic is a series of typical questions\\nthat should be addressed if that topic is going to be part of the\\naudit. To tailor this checklist, the auditor should determine\\nwhich topics apply to the audit and whether questions should be\\nanswered by interviews, examination of the software products and\\ndocuments, examination of records, or a combination of methods.\\nThe auditor then should sort the questions by the method that is\\nintended to be used to answer them, and further, by the precise\\nsource to be used. For example, questions about how CMoperates\\nmight be asked of the CMmanagerduring an interview, but someof\\nthose samequestions might be directed at the person who operates\\nthe project's computer program library. Answers to other CM\\nquestions might be found through an examination of the records of\\nthe CMprocess; still others by an examination of code and\\ndocumentation products.\\nAs muchas possible, questions should be phrased in terms of the\\nspecific project and organization being audited, and should use\\nthe namesand terms that the project uses. This tailoring will\\ntake somework on the part of the auditor, but this effort will\\nbe repaid by the fact that effective communication will be\\nestablished earlier.\\nThe parts of the tailored checklist that will be answered by an\\nexamination of records or products should be put on a form for\\nuse on-site. The form can be simple, but should allow space for\\nanswers to each question and additional comments. The form\\nshould, if possible, allow the checking of boxes or simple entry\\nof information.\\nAs the auditor proceeds with the site visit, the checklists and\\nforms can be completed with the information obtained. The\\nauditor must retain the flexibility to modify the forms or\\nquestions as information is gathered. Additional questions are\\nlikely to be suggested by answers given, and forms maynot have\\nbeen properly madein advance to record the real situation. It\\nis important to rememberthat the checklist and forms derived\\nfrom it are guides, and that the objective of the audit is to\\nunderstand and report on the actual state of affairs in the\\ndeveloping organization.\\nVII. AUDITINGIN THEABSENCEOFSTANDARDSANDPROCEDURES\\nAn auditor maybe asked to \\\"audit\\\" a project that lacks\\ndocumentedstandards and procedures, perhaps because of warning\\nsigns indicated in Chapter IV. Most often, this type of audit\\nwill be external to the project, even if the auditor is employed\\nby the developing organization, because a developer that does not\\nhave documentedstandards and procedures is unlikely to have an\\ninternal audit program.\\nAll projects generate code and documentation, but if there are no\\nwritten standards, the products will be in the style of the\\nindividual technical performers or their managers. All projects\\nhandle changes and problems, and test their software. The\\nmethods maybe somewhatad-hoc and dependent on the specific\\nindividuals involved in a specific case, but they do exist,\\ndocumentedor not. The role of the auditor is to discover and\\ndocument the \\\"standards\\\" and \\\"procedures\\\" that are actually\\nfollowed.\\nAfter the auditor has determined from interviews what \\\"standards\\\"\\nand \\\"procedures\\\" are followed, the rest of the audit can proceed\\nlike any other audit. That is, the auditor can follow the\\nprogress of control paths and determine the extent to which the\\nprocedures are followed versus the numberof exceptions that are\\nallowed. The auditor can sample the products and rate their\\nconformance to the (unwritten) standards.\\nThe auditor must gather enough information to evaluate the\\nsuitability and consistency of the unwritten standards and\\nprocedures. The auditor maybe experienced enough to do the\\nevaluation, or the auditor maywish to leave the evaluation to\\nthe managemento which he/she will report. In either case, the\\nauditor has to gather information on product quality, consistency\\nof application of the unwritten rules, the adequacy of testing\\nand reviews, and instances of confusion and/or error that may\\nhave resulted from uncertainty. This information is then used\\nfor evaluation.\\nVIII. QUALITIESOFANAUDITOR\\nThe major contribution of an internal or external auditor to\\nproject success is the collection and presentation of information\\nthat allows project managementa clear view of the product's\\nactual status and the actual compliance with standards and\\nprocedures. This requires an impartial auditor. In particular,\\nan internal auditor must rememberthat covering up problems, due\\nto feelings of empathy with the project staff or a desire to\\npresent the developer's organization in a good light, is\\ncounterproductive. Problems that are not brought to light will\\nnot be solved, and mayresult in muchlarger problems later in\\nthe life cycle.\\nA good auditor should have a basic understanding of the software\\ndevelopment life cycle and the products and processes involved in\\neach of its phases. If an auditor is expected to evaluate the\\nstandards and procedures used by the developer and to judge their\\nimpact on product quality and project schedule, then he/she needs\\nsignificant experience and background in software development and\\nsoftware management. It helps if the auditor is knowledgeable\\nabout the type of software being audited, and is aware of the\\nspecific software development procedures used in the project. It\\nis useful if the auditor is experienced or trained in auditing\\ntechniques.\\nIX. TECHNIQUESANDTOOLS\\nThe most frequently used tool for an SQAaudit is an audit\\nchecklist. The checklist must be tailored to the project to be\\naudited, as it provides a list of questions that must be answered\\nabout that particular project.\\nAutomated tools, either brought by the auditor or provided by the\\nproject, maybe used if compatible with the project's standards\\nand procedures. For example, the project mayhave a standards\\nchecker for code. The auditor can run the checker on a sample of\\nthe code, or can verify that the project runs the checker.\\nThe checklist tailoring and form-making process also maybe\\nassisted by keeping a generic checklist in a database or word\\nprocessor. The tailored information maythen be automatically\\ntransferred to a form or brought to the audit on a laptop\\ncomputer.\\nAPPENDIXA: SQAAUDITREPORT\\nThe following is the minimumcontent for an SQAaudit report.\\ni .

      "        \"abstract\": \"Internal and external food safety audits are conducted to assess the safety and quality of food including on-farm production, manufacturing practices, sanitation, and hygiene. Some auditors are direct stakeholders that are employed by food establishments to conduct internal audits, while other auditors may represent the interests of a second party purchaser or a third-party auditing agency. Some buyers conduct their own audits or additional testing, while some buyers trust the results of third-party audits or inspections.

Some buyers conduct their own 49 audits or additional testing, while some buyers trust the results of third-party audits or 50 inspections.  Third-party auditors, however, use various food safety audit standards 51 and most do not have a vested interest in the products being sold. Audits are conducted 52 under a proprietary standard, while food safety inspections are generally conducted 53 within a legal framework. There have been many foodborne illness outbreaks linked to 54 food processors that have passed third-party audits and inspections, raising questions 55 about the utility of both. Supporters argue third-party audits are a way to ensure food 56 safety in an era of dwindling economic resources. Critics contend that while external 57 audits and inspections can be a valuable tool to help ensure safe food, such activities 58 represent only a snapshot in time. This paper identifies limitations of food safety 59 inspections and audits and provides recommendations for strengthening the system, 60 based on developing a strong food safety culture, including risk-based verification 61 steps, throughout the food safety system. 62  63 1.0 Introduction 64  65 Billions of meals are prepared safely each day throughout the world. The commercial 66 food system relies on audits and inspections to assess the practices and processes used 67 to by food producers at each step in the production chain. Yet when outbreaks of 68 foodborne illness happen, the results can be emotionally, physically and financially 69 devastating to the victims and the businesses involved. Many outbreaks involve firms 70 that have had their food production systems verified and received acceptable ratings 71 from food safety auditors or government inspectors. 72  73 Food safety audits and inspections are one activity used to verify that a food producer 74 or individual is following specific guidelines, requirements or rules. Audits involve a 75 \\u201csystematic and independent examination to determine whether quality/safety 76 activities and related results comply with planned arrangements and whether these 77 arrangements are implemented effectively and are suitable to achieve objectives\\u201d 78 (ANZFA, 2001; ANZFA was later morphed into Food Standards Australia New 79 Zealand). Planned arrangements, as defined by the Australia New Zealand Food 80 Authority are commonly referred to as standards within the food industry. The 81 difference between inspections and audits is that an inspection evaluates \\u201cconformity 82 by measuring, observing, testing or gauging the relevant characteristics\\u201d(ANZFA, 83 2001). Audits are one tool to help ensure adherence to recognized regulations and good 84 manufacturing practices. 85   86 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3  An audit of food safety practices, facilities, documentation and written procedures is 87 used to gather information regarding food production and processing practices being 88 followed by a particular producer, identifying areas for improvement and areas that are 89 deficient (ANZFA, 2001). Audit reports, in theory, serve as the \\u201ceyes and ears\\u201d for an 90 organization buying food from a supplier (Weise, 2010). There are several types of 91 audits, and a variety of audit organizations, each with their own unique or common 92 food safety guidelines.  93  94 Self-audits are internal audits performed by a food establishment itself.  These 95 businesses usually have a quality assurance team that leads the internal audits. These 96 internal audits may have good potential for reducing risk if the methods followed are 97 those outlined in widely accepted codes and risk assessment guidance documents. The 98 effectiveness of internal audits is also assessed during third-party audits. Second-party 99 audits are audits that a downstream company, or buyer, performs on their supplier. 100 Third-party audits are performed by an outside firm that usually focuses entirely on 101 verification or standard implementation to ensure that a buyer\\u2019s rules are being 102 followed (Costa, 2010). Third-party audits examine compliance with laws and codes of 103 practice as well as provide \\u201cinsight into management controls and supervision\\u201d (Costa, 104 2010).  105  106 2.0 The role of audits in food safety 107  108 Third-party audits are one part of a multi-factorial approach to food safety. The 109 popularity of third-party audits has increased corresponding to a shift in food safety 110 governance away from government regulation and inspection towards the 111 development of private food safety standards (Busch, 2011).   112  113 Standard setting organizations (e.g. International Organization for Standardization 114 (ISO) and the British Retail Consortium [BRC]) include industry consortia, private 115 voluntary associations and buyers.  There are many different food safety standards 116 available to food producers and manufacturers even within a single industry segment. 117 While the various standards are voluntary, demand by buyers essentially makes 118 certification or verification under these standards de facto mandatory for food 119 companies that want to continue to sell their product to major retailers (Busch, 2011). 120 This has created a system for enforcing food safety standards without significantly 121 increasing burden on taxpayers.  122  123 In addition, if a company such as Walmart wanted specific standards for a product, 124 even if it exceeded U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards, the company 125 would demand that from the auditor -- and get it (Prevor, 2009). 126  127 While inspectors play an active role in overseeing compliance, the burden for food 128 safety lies primarily with food producers (GAO, 2008). Inspection efforts, even if 129 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4  doubled, would not be enough to make sure every food item is safe. Third party audits 130 provide the data upon which certification and buying decisions are made, and are now 131 a popular choice for retailers who use them to push the responsibility (and costs) for 132 food safety and quality back on to the supplier (Steir, 2009). Audits are an attempt to 133 move beyond inspections that are point-in-time observations of activities and practices.  134 Audits focus on the procedures in place to achieve food safety outcomes and look for 135 evidence that they are being followed and are appropriate and capable of reducing risk.  136 There is also increasing focus on assessment of food safety culture and management 137 commitment to food safety.  138  139 Third-party audits also benefit individual companies and supply chains. It has been 140 argued that the best use of third-party audits is to focus on strengthening self-audit 141 methods and operational controls to achieve safer food (Costa, 2010).For some, it is a 142 genuine desire to improve food safety, quality and sanitation or a way to 143 solve/troubleshoot existing problems (Steir, 2009).  For others it is a potential marketing 144 advantage or a customer requirement. The effectiveness of these audits may link to the 145 motivation behind the audit.  It has been determined that creating a food safety culture 146 is imperative to an effective food safety risk management system (Powell et al., 2011; 147 Yiannas, 2008).  Companies with a strong food safety culture may be more likely to 148 obtain a third party audit because they want to improve operations, not just because of 149 customer demand.  Companies with a strong food safety culture are also likely to use 150 audit results as guidance and opportunity to improve their practices.  Audits -- first- 151 second- or third-party -- are another tool for companies to enhance safe food 152 production. 153  154 What is not clear is the role of third party audits in reducing the risk of contaminated 155 food reaching the marketplace and the ability of auditors to identify problems or high-156 risk operations.  The utility of third party audits has been examined in other industries 157 as well. A 10-year study on workplace safety on U.S. railroads found that high audit 158 scores partially correlated with improved legislative compliance but did not necessarily 159 correspond to improved safety performance (Peterson, 2001). This indicated there were 160 problems somewhere in the system and that the audit process was not necessarily valid 161 for that industry. 162  163 3.0 Limitations of audits 164  165 Audit systems, in their current form, have limitations in improving food safety.  There 166 are no current empirical evaluations that look at the correlation between audit scores 167 and foodborne illness outbreaks but there is a long and storied history of food safety 168 failures involving third-party audits. 169  170 Third-party audits are analogous in many ways to regulatory municipal inspections of 171 foodservice operations: the effectiveness of both audits and inspections is driven largely 172 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 5  by observational judgment and consistency of the inspector or auditor. Foodservice 173 inspection is a cornerstone of local public health, yet inspection scores can be poor 174 predictors of foodborne illness. Jones and colleagues (2004) examined over 160,000 175 inspections in Tennessee over seven years and found no difference between scores of 176 foodservices associated with outbreaks and those that were not. Similar results were 177 previously found in Miami-Dade county (Cruz et al., 2001). In Massachusetts, 178 researchers found that jurisdictions had different inspection criteria, and even within a 179 given jurisdiction, a risk to one inspector may not be a risk to another (DeNucci 2007). 180  181 Many foodborne illness outbreaks have been linked to farms, processors and retailers 182 that went through some form of audit certification. The January 2009 outbreak of 183 Salmonella Typhimurium linked to the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) has been 184 frequently cited as an example of a failure in the third party auditing system (Busch, 185 2011; Steir, 2009; Moss and Martin, 2009).  In  January, 2009 PCA recalled over 3,900 186 peanut butter and other peanut-containing products from more than 350 companies 187 (FDA, 2009b), 691 people were sickened and nine died across 46 U.S. states and in 188 Canada (CDC, 2009a). 189  190 Moss and Martin (2009) reported in the New York Times that an auditor with AIB was 191 responsible for evaluating the safety of products produced by PCA. The peanut 192 company knew in advance when the auditors were arriving. \\u201cThe overall food safety 193 level of this facility was considered to be: SUPERIOR,\\u201d the auditor concluded in his 194 March 27, 2008, report for AIB. A copy of the audit was obtained by the Times. AIB was 195 not alone in missing the trouble at the PCA plant in Blakely, Georgia. State inspectors 196 also found only minor problems.  This outbreak and others highlight some of the 197 limitations of both third party audits and government inspections which are included in 198 Table I below. 199  200 Table I \\u2013 Limitations of Third Party Audits 201 Audit Limitations Summary Example A snapshot in time Audits and inspections remain point-in-time assessments that represent a small fraction of food production time and volume. If conducted properly and the results acted upon, audits can reveal strengths and weaknesses in a food safety program, but cannot guarantee future performance. Further, auditors can only examine what a company provides, although skilled auditors know what to ask for and may be able to identify clues to systemic problems.   PCA outbreak, a federal team of investigators later uncovered a number of alarming signs at the peanut plant including testing records from the company itself that showed Salmonella in its products as far back as June 2007 (Martin, 2009) MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 6  Reliance on an effective standard The audit is only as effective as the standard against which the practices are being measured. Standards must be evidence-based, designed to address the commodity/product specific risks and practices and responsive to changing industry practices and new science as it becomes available. Cantaloupe outbreak, July 2011. Previous research had focused on Salmonella and current industry standards may not be robust enough to address risk from Listeria.   Effective audit tool The audit tool (or audit checklist) must be valid. There is no scientific basis for certification/validation in audits (Mahshie, 2009). There is high variability in the quality and reliability of audits and many different types of audit tools that vary in length, complexity, and style. A firm may pass some audits but still have a food safety risk factor Salmonella in eggs, Iowa, 2010, lead to 2,000 illnesses and the recall of 500 million eggs. DeCoster received a superior rating from AIB International, despite audit reports that are typically 10-20 pages and consider over 300 elements (AIB International, 2007). Auditor competence Audits require more than just a checklist, they require paying attention and thinking. The individual ability of an auditor has a significant impact on the outcome of the audit, most third-party audits look for objective evidence to assess compliance, but effective auditors must be able to assess risk, particularly in unique situations and synthesize the information provided to determine effectiveness of the food safety management system In the aftermath of the PCA outbreak, the competency of both the auditor and the auditing firm were criticized. The auditor of the PCA facility was an experienced auditor but was an expert in fresh produce and was not aware that peanuts were susceptible to Salmonella (Moss and Martin, 2009) Audit scope The audit scope must be broad enough to cover all operations, locations and products. When a company is presented with different price quotes they often choose the cheapest one, which is more likely the one with less audit time (Pronk, 2011). This reduces cost for the firm requesting the audit, and reduces the ability of the auditor to see all parts of a complex operation as well as the possibility of the auditor finding instances of non-compliance. On June 28, 2007, Veggie Booty snack food was linked to an outbreak of Salmonella. The plant that made Veggie Booty had received a rating of \\u201cexcellent\\u201d from AIB International, raising questions about the efficacy of auditors and audits, which, in this case and others, did not extend to ingredient suppliers (Moss & Martin, 2009).  Conflict of Interest Almost all food producers/retailers require their suppliers to pay for their own audits. A company receiving a poor audit may be unwilling to hire that auditor again. Even with safeguards in place, auditing bodies still must rely on the honesty of their auditors to declare potential conflicts Follow-up Auditors have no legal authority and cannot demand records, embargo products or close an operation (Costa, 2011). Neither the auditor nor the audited company is required to report non-compliances, even automatic failures, to regulatory agencies. If the buyer does not review the audit report closely, which is often the case (Prevor, 2011a), they may never know that their supplier had a serious non-conformance.  202 In response to some of the criticisms around third party audits and standards and the 203 growing number of private standards with no real oversight over their development, 204 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 7  the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) was launched in May, 2000. GFSI is a non-profit 205 foundation managed by the consumer goods forum (GFSI, 2012). GFSI is a 206 benchmarking system where \\u201call recognized schemes have a common foundation of 207 requirements which should provide consistent results, in regard to the common 208 requirements applied during the audit, but the benchmarked schemes cannot be 209 considered as equal\\u201d (GFSI, 2012). One objective of the initiative is to reduce costs 210 within the system by reducing the number of different audits a firm requires for their 211 different customers. The success of the GFSI approach has not been evaluated to date. 212  213  214 4.0 Improving audits and inspections 215  216 Food safety auditors and inspectors are an integral part of the food safety system, and 217 their use will expand in the future, for both domestic and imported foodstuffs. 218 Supporters of third-party audits argue this type of audit augments the efforts of food 219 regulatory agencies, such as FDA, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and 220 others.  221  222 Auditing can be helpful, in theory. Audit reports, are only useful if the purchaser or  223 food producer them reviews the results, understands the risks addressed by the 224 standards and makes risk-reduction decisions based on the results. From past examples, 225 there appears to be a disconnect between what auditors provide (a snapshot) and what 226 buyers believe they are doing (a full verification of product and process).  227  228 Third-party auditing can also assist regulatory agencies by providing the extra 229 assessment and data a regulatory agency might not be able to collect as often as 230 required \\u2013 but only if the data is shared with regulatory agencies. Audits and 231 inspections can assist in the development of a food safety culture by dictating criteria 232 for the sale of goods (Acheson, 2010). The training component for employees is another 233 use of audits in the daily implementation of food safety practices (AIB International, 234 2007). Third-party audits also provide \\u201cthousands of checks and balances to the food 235 supply system with no direct cost to taxpayers\\u201d (AIB International, 2007). However, 236 theory and practice can differ. 237  238 Critics see many problems with the general way third-party audits are currently 239 conducted and have described them as the equivalent of \\u201cmail-order diplomas\\u201d (Moss 240 & Martin, 2009).  As far as being the \\u201ceyes and ears\\u201d for a company buying from the 241 audited supplier, many problems are apparently missed during visits (Weise, 2010). 242 Heavy reliance on prescriptive checklists may increase auditor consistency, allow for 243 cost savings on training but also reduces their ability to assess risk. This ultimately 244 results in a pool of auditors that are poorly qualified to assess the risks associated 245 within individual operations. It is imperative for the food industry to aggressively take 246 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 8  corrective actions and make third-party audits and inspections more meaningful, more 247 accurate, and to fully enhance the safety of consumers. 248  249 Good auditors look beyond what is on their checklist and can synthesize the various 250 pieces of information they get to put together a clear picture of whether the operation is 251 doing what they say they are doing.  Certification bodies must also embrace a food 252 safety culture, ensuring their auditors have the appropriate training, oversight, 253 knowledge and support. 254  255 In an effort to improve the third party audit system, FDA is working to establish 256 accreditation programs under a new food safety law, to insure the quality of audits 257 (Karst, 2011). FDA is also trying to make audit results accessible so they can analyze the 258 results for effectiveness and reliability (Karst, 2011). FDA released guidance for industry 259 in 2009 regarding voluntary third-party certification programs for foods and feeds 260 (FDA, 2009a). In this document, it is clearly stated that industry has the primary 261 responsibility to ensure that food products are safe and meet FDA requirements. The 262 document outlines recommendations for third-party certification programs such as 263 qualifications and training for auditors including coursework and field training. These 264 recommendations, though helpful, are not \\u201clegally established responsibilities\\u201d and the 265 extensive use of the word \\u201cshould\\u201d in the document infers a recommendation rather 266 than a requirement (FDA, 2009a). 267  268 Third-party audits are only one performance indicator and need to be supplemented 269 with microbial testing, second-party audits of suppliers and the in-house capacity to 270 meaningfully assess the results of audits and inspections. Any and all raw product 271 suppliers should be included in the audit scope. More effective audit systems 272 incorporate unannounced visits along with supplemental information into their 273 framework and require extensive documentation of internal audits, regulatory 274 compliance, laboratory results and raw product certifications. 275  276 Preventive measures such as instilling and enhancing a food safety culture, where there 277 are shared values throughout the organization that support risk-reduction, may 278 improve the safety of the food supply by supplying daily reminders, incentives and 279 food safety priorities in the absence of inspectors or auditors. Improving and 280 encouraging communication with front-line employees \\u2013 any food producer is only as 281 good as its worst front-line staff \\u2013 can help mitigate high-risk situations such as at PCA, 282 where employees said the facility was \\u201ca dump,\\u201d but did not report their concerns to 283 officials before people became ill and died (Sharp, 2009). Audits, regulatory inspections 284 and testing are an important part of the food safety system, but alone and individually 285 they are not enough.  286  287 Education and training are the focus of many food handling behavior interventions. 288 However, research suggests that the impacts of food handler training programs are 289 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 9  often inconsistent, and program evaluation is rarely conducted (Almanza & Nesmith, 290 2004; Egan et al., 2007; Frash et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 2008). Measuring knowledge 291 change is a poor indicator of changes in practices.  Yiannas (2008) points out the 292 limitations of focusing entirely on training as food safety culture indicators and 293 suggests training is just one factor of a good organization. Conscientious proprietors 294 provide training and proper tools, remove barriers, and proceed with a focus on 295 positive food safety behavior. The lack of food safety expertise within an organization 296 to effectively evaluate and interpret audit or inspection results may compound 297 problems. Standards applied by auditing firms and regulatory inspections often include 298 training as a component, but outbreak history suggests that little evaluation of 299 effectiveness is explored. 300  301 Researchers have suggested that the only reliable measure of effectiveness of food 302 safety culture-supporting intervention material is through the observation of food 303 preparation practices (Redmond and Griffith, 2003; Anderson et al., 2004; Redmond et 304 al., 2004; Chapman et al., 2010).   305  306 In 2010, beef processor JBS started a trial using video cameras as part of their third-307 party monitoring and auditing efforts (Crews, 2011). Strategically placed cameras 308 recorded footage that could then be observed by auditors around-the-clock and random 309 audits could then be conducted remotely. Not only does this allow for immediate 310 feedback, it has also proven an effective training tool for employees, as they can observe 311 and learn from watching themselves at work (Crews, 2011). Improvement at the pilot 312 plant was seen in days instead of months and compliance rates consistently exceeded 313 99%. Errors can be addressed almost immediately before problems develop (Crews, 314 2011).   315  316 Assessing food-handling practices of staff through internal observations, externally-led 317 evaluations, and audit and inspection results can provide indicators of a food safety 318 culture. Results of these evaluations can be used to modify interventions and further 319 improve the organization\\u2019s culture of food safety (Mitchell et al, 2007). 320  321 Since most commercial food establishments are audited or inspected, it remains likely 322 that any food establishment that becomes associated with a foodborne illness outbreak 323 will have had some type of audit in the past.  Audits still do not guarantee safe food 324 and have inherent limitations based upon stakeholder involvement, auditor 325 competence, audit scope, and audit system.  326  327 In August 2008, Listeria monocytogenes-contaminated deli meats produced by Maple Leaf 328 Foods, Inc. of Canada caused 57 illnesses and 22 deaths (Weatherill, 2009). A panel of 329 international food safety experts convened by Maple Leaf Foods, Inc. to investigate the 330 source of the deli meat contamination determined that the most probable contamination 331 source was mechanical meat slicers that, despite cleaning according to the 332 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 10  manufacturer\\u2019s instructions, had meat residue trapped deep inside the slicing 333 mechanisms (Weatherill, 2009). An independent investigative review commissioned by 334 the Canadian federal government concluded that the focus on food safety was 335 insufficient among senior management at both the company and the various 336 government organizations involved before and during the outbreak; that insufficient 337 planning had been undertaken to be prepared for a potential outbreak; and that those 338 involved lacked a sense of urgency at the outset of the outbreak (Mason, 2009).  339  340 The specific plant linked to the outbreak received satisfactory marks from federal 341 inspectors for complying with federal regulatory requirements. They appeared to be 342 doing everything right. Employees consistently addressed instances of non-compliance 343 when they were identified. The plant\\u2019s management maintained all required records, 344 ensured that staff training took place, and ensured the established quality assurance 345 program was followed. At all plants, the company conducted environmental testing 346 that went beyond regulatory requirements (Weatherill, 2009).  Prior to the outbreak, 347 Maple Leaf Foods, Inc. conducted more than 3,000 environmental tests annually at the 348 implicated plant and tested products monthly (McCain, 2009). Although no product 349 tests revealed the presence of Listeria spp., a number of environmental samples detected 350 the bacteria in the months before the public was alerted in August to possible 351 contamination (CFIA, 2009; McCain, 2009). However, the company failed to recognize 352 and identify the underlying cause of a sporadic yet persistent pattern of environmental 353 test results that were positive for Listeria spp. and was not obliged to report these results. 354  355 The use of audits to help create, improve, and maintain a genuine food safety culture 356 holds the most promise in preventing foodborne illness and safeguarding public health. 357 A common thread in all of the outbreaks described above is a clear lack of food safety 358 culture among the implicated companies. In the E. coli outbreak in South Wales, a 359 public inquiry into the outbreak by Professor Hugh Pennington (2009) found that, in 360 addition to allowing cross contamination through the operation\\u2019s single vacuum 361 packaging machine, butcher William Tudor encouraged ill employees to continue 362 working in establishments and preparing meat for sale. Upon review of statements 363 made by employees and environmental health officers to the police, of video and 364 photographic evidence, and of management documentation, Professor Chris Griffith 365 (2010), head of the food research and consultancy unit at the University of Wales 366 Institute, Cardiff, told the inquiry the culture at the premises was one of little regard for 367 the importance of food safety but where making and saving money was the priority. 368 Health code violations at the abattoir were longstanding, repetitive and widely known 369 among environmental health officers responsible for inspecting the operation. Although 370 foodborne illness may not always be completely preventable, that the risk of a business 371 causing foodborne illness is, to a large extent, a consequence of its own activities. Audit 372 and inspection information must be leveraged into corrective actions to mitigate risk.   373  374 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 11  Food safety culture, not only within the company but also within a supply chain should 375 also be emphasized.  In both the Odwalla and PCA outbreaks, second-party audits were 376 able to identify problems the third party auditors did not.  Open communication 377 between suppliers and buyers including expectations and risk management practices is 378 essential.  Systems where retailers work with their suppliers to help them achieve 379 objectives have had somewhat better buy-in from suppliers and may achieve better 380 results because they reinforce that culture. (Rains, 2009; Steir, 2009).  381  382 Third-party auditing is a business, where an organization or business pays another firm 383 to verify whether a supplier is following agreed-upon standards.  While third-party 384 auditors are not in the same position as regulatory inspectors with respect to policing an 385 industry \\u2013 they can provide information upon which buyers can make decisions. Based 386 on historic examples, audit results have not been well understood by requiring buyers 387 (Griffith, 2010; Schmit, 2009). It is incumbent on auditing firms and food businesses 388 commissioning audits to understand the strengths and limitations of any evaluation 389 process. Companies who blame the auditor or inspector for outbreaks of foodborne 390 illness should also blame themselves. 391  392 References 393 Acheson, D. (2010.)

Some buyers conduct their own 49 audits or additional testing, while some buyers trust the results of third-party audits or 50 inspections.  Third-party auditors, however, use various food safety audit standards 51 and most do not have a vested interest in the products being sold. Audits are conducted 52 under a proprietary standard, while food safety inspections are generally conducted 53 within a legal framework. There have been many foodborne illness outbreaks linked to 54 food processors that have passed third-party audits and inspections, raising questions 55 about the utility of both. Supporters argue third-party audits are a way to ensure food 56 safety in an era of dwindling economic resources. Critics contend that while external 57 audits and inspections can be a valuable tool to help ensure safe food, such activities 58 represent only a snapshot in time. This paper identifies limitations of food safety 59 inspections and audits and provides recommendations for strengthening the system, 60 based on developing a strong food safety culture, including risk-based verification 61 steps, throughout the food safety system. 62  63 1.0 Introduction 64  65 Billions of meals are prepared safely each day throughout the world. Much of that food 66 is deemed safe by some form of verification of practices, known commonly in the 67 commercial food system as external audits or inspection. Yet when outbreaks of 68 foodborne illness happen, the results can be emotionally, physically and financially 69 devastating to the victims and the businesses involved. Many outbreaks involve firms 70 that have had their food production systems verified and received acceptable ratings 71 from food safety auditors or government inspectors. 72  73 Food safety audits and inspections are one activity used to verify that a food producer 74 or individual is following specific guidelines, requirements or rules. Audits involve a 75 \\u201csystematic and independent examination to determine whether quality/safety 76 activities and related results comply with planned arrangements and whether these 77 arrangements are implemented effectively and are suitable to achieve objectives\\u201d 78 (ANZFA, 2001; ANZFA was later morphed into Food Standards Australia New 79 Zealand). Planned arrangements, as defined by the Australia New Zealand Food 80 Authority are commonly referred to as standards within the food industry. The 81 difference between inspections and audits is that an inspection evaluates \\u201cconformity 82 by measuring, observing, testing or gauging the relevant characteristics\\u201d(ANZFA, 83 2001). Audits may be supplemented with microbiological and quality assurance 84 product testing and process inspections by regulatory agencies or industry to help 85 ensure adherence to recognized regulations and good manufacturing practices.  86 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3  Reactive investigations based on direct consumer complaints or concerns raised 87 through social media may provide additional information. 88   89 An audit of food safety practices, facilities, documentation and written procedures is 90 used to gather information regarding food production and processing practices being 91 followed by a particular producer, identifying areas for improvement and areas that are 92 deficient (ANZFA, 2001). Audit reports, in theory, serve as the \\u201ceyes and ears\\u201d for an 93 organization buying food from a supplier (Weise, 2010). There are several types of 94 audits, and a variety of audit organizations, each with their own unique or common 95 food safety guidelines.  96  97 Self-audits are internal audits performed by a food establishment itself.  These 98 businesses usually have a quality assurance team that leads the internal audits. These 99 internal audits may have good potential for reducing risk if the methods followed are 100 those outlined in widely accepted codes and risk assessment guidance documents. 101 Second-party audits are audits that a downstream company, or buyer, performs on their 102 supplier. Third-party audits are performed by an outside firm that usually focuses 103 entirely on verification or standard implementation to ensure that a buyer\\u2019s rules are 104 being followed (Costa, 2010). Third-party audits examine compliance with laws and 105 codes of practice as well as provide \\u201cinsight into management controls and 106 supervision\\u201d (Costa, 2010).  107  108 2.0 The role of audits in food safety 109  110 Third-party audits are one part of a multi-factorial approach to food safety. The 111 popularity of third-party audits has increased corresponding to a shift in food safety 112 governance away from government regulation and inspection towards the 113 development of private food safety standards (Busch, 2011).  Standard setting 114 organizations (e.g. International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the British 115 Retail Consortium (BRC)) include industry consortia, private voluntary associations 116 and buyers.  There are many different food safety standards available to food producers 117 and manufacturers even within a single industry segment. While the various standards 118 are voluntary, demand by buyers essentially makes certification or verification under 119 these standards de facto mandatory for food companies that want to continue to sell 120 their product to major retailers (Busch, 2011). This has created a system for enforcing 121 food safety standards with little burden on taxpayers.  122  123 Costa (2010) argues that third-party audits should focus on strengthening self-audit 124 methods and operational controls to achieve safer food and maximize benefits. The U.S. 125 Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted in a 2008 report that, while inspectors 126 or auditors play an active role in overseeing compliance, the burden for food safety lies 127 primarily with food producers (GAO, 2008). For example, Prevor (2011b) argues that if 128 a company such as Walmart wanted specific standards for a product, even if it exceeded 129 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards, the company would demand that 130 from the auditor -- and get it. Doering (2010) has also said responsibility for verification 131 primarily lies with industry, given that inspection efforts, even if doubled, would not be 132 enough to make sure every food item is safe. Third-party audits provide the data upon 133 which certification and buying decisions are made, and are now a popular choice for 134 retailers who use them to push the responsibility (and costs) for food safety and quality 135 back on to the supplier (Steir, 2009).  136  137 Third-party audits are relied upon within a single company or supply chain for a 138 number of reasons. For some, it is a genuine desire to improve food safety, quality and 139 sanitation or a way to solve/troubleshoot existing problems (Steir, 2009).  For others it is 140 a potential marketing advantage or a customer requirement.   The effectiveness of these 141 audits may link to the motivation behind the audit.  It has been determined that 142 creating a food safety culture is imperative to an effective food safety risk management 143 system (Powell et al., 2011; Yiannas, 2008).  Companies with a strong food safety culture  144 may be more likely to obtain a third party audit because they want to improve 145 operations, not just because of customer demand.  Companies with a strong food safety 146 culture are also likely to use audit results as guidance and opportunity to improve their 147 practices.  Audits -- first- second- or third-party -- are another tool for companies to 148 enhance safe food production. 149  150 What is not clear is the role of third party audits in reducing the risk of contaminated 151 food reaching the marketplace and the ability of auditors to identify problems or high 152 risk operations.  The utility of third party audits has been examined in other industries 153 as well. A 10-year study on workplace safety on U.S. railroads found that high audit 154 scores partially correlated with improved legislative compliance but did not necessarily 155 correspond to improved safety performance (Peterson, 2001). This indicated there were 156 problems somewhere in the system and that the audit process was not necessarily valid 157 for that industry. 158  159 3.0 Limitations of audits 160  161 Audit systems, in their current form, have limitations in improving food safety.  There 162 are no current empirical evaluations that look at the correlation between audit scores 163 and foodborne illness outbreaks but there is a long and storied history of food safety 164 failures involving third-party audits and inspections. 165  166 Third-party audits are analogous in many ways to regulatory municipal inspections of 167 foodservice operations: the effectiveness of both audits and inspections is driven largely 168 by observational judgment and consistency of the inspector or auditor. Foodservice 169 inspection is a cornerstone of local public health, yet inspection scores can be poor 170 predictors of foodborne illness. Jones and colleagues (2004) examined over 160,000 171 inspections in Tennessee over 7 years and found no difference between scores of 172 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 5  foodservices associated with outbreaks and those that were not. Similar results were 173 previously found in Miami-Dade county (Cruz et al., 2001). In Massachusetts, 174 researchers found that jurisdictions had different inspection criteria, and even within a 175 given jurisdiction, a risk to one inspector may not be a risk to another (DeNucci 2007). 176  177 Many foodborne illness outbreaks have been linked to farms, processors and retailers 178 that went through some form of audit certification. The January 2009 outbreak of 179 Salmonella Typhimurium linked to the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) has been 180 frequently cited as an example of a failure in the third party auditing system (Busch, 181 2011; Steir, 2009; Moss and Martin, 2009).  In  January, 2009 PCA recalled over 3,900 182 peanut butter and other peanut-containing products from more than 350 companies 183 (FDA, 2009b), 691 people were sickened and nine died across 46 U.S. states and in 184 Canada (CDC, 2009a). 185  186 Moss and Martin (2009) reported in the New York Times that an auditor with AIB was 187 responsible for evaluating the safety of products produced by PCA. The peanut 188 company knew in advance when the auditors were arriving. \\u201cThe overall food safety 189 level of this facility was considered to be: SUPERIOR,\\u201d the auditor concluded in his 190 March 27, 2008, report for AIB. A copy of the audit was obtained by the Times. AIB was 191 not alone in missing the trouble at the PCA plant in Blakely, Georgia. State inspectors 192 also found only minor problems.  This outbreak and others highlight some of the 193 limitations of both third party audits and government inspections which are included in 194 Table I below. 195  196  197 The Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) is a non-profit foundation managed by the 198 consumer goods forum (GFSI, 2012) and was launched in May 2000 as a response to the 199 growing number of private standards. GFSI is a benchmarking system where \\u201call 200 recognized schemes have a common foundation of requirements which should provide 201 consistent results, in regard to the common requirements applied during the audit, but 202 the benchmarked schemes cannot be considered as equal\\u201d (GFSI, 2012). One objective of 203 the initiative is to reduce costs within the system by reducing the number of different 204 audits a firm requires for their different customers. The success of the GFSI approach 205 has not been evaluated to date. 206  207 Some auditing companies and standards owners are trying to prevent situations where 208 a company may have a food safety problem but still obtain a passing grade, through the 209 application of mandatory or automatic failures (Steir, 2009). The use of auto-failures in 210 an audit is becoming more common.   High-risk activities are identified, such as the 211 quality of water used for washing fresh produce, and if the producer is not compliant 212 with those items, they fail the audit regardless of the final score. Many standards also 213 allow the auditor to suggest an auto-failure if they identify and document any situation 214 they deem to be an immediate food safety risk (CanadaGAP, 2012). 215 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 6   216 Audit vs Inspections 217 Government inspectors have also failed to prevent foodborne illness outbreaks. Five-218 year-old Mason Jones was one of 157 people \\u2013 primarily children \\u2013 who became ill in an 219 outbreak in South Wales caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7 in September 2005. The 220 outbreak was traced to the consumption of cooked meats provided to schools by John 221 Tudor & Son, a catering butcher business. A packaging machine at the business, used 222 for both raw and cooked meats, was identified as the probable source of contamination 223 \\u2013 where E. coli O157:H7 was most likely transferred from raw meat to cooked meat and 224 was then distributed to four authorities in South Wales for their school meal programs. 225 Ultimately, 31 people were admitted to hospital and, tragically, Mason Jones died. 226  227 Following the Wales outbreak, a number of mistakes and shortcomings by 228 environmental health officers were identified \\u2013 which in no way lessened the primary 229 responsibility on the supplier of contaminated food --  including the failure of one 230 officer to verify claims that all food handlers had food hygiene certificates and the 231 failure by another to insist that steps be taken to prevent cross contamination between 232 raw and cooked meats during vacuum packaging (Pennington, 2009). Brian Curtis, a 233 retired senior U.K. Food Standards Agency official, told the inquiry that the Hazard 234 Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan reportedly used by John Tudor & Son, 235 and reviewed by Mr. Curtis at the time of the inquiry, would not ensure the production 236 of safe food. Mr. Curtis faulted environmental health officers for failing to identify the 237 deficiencies and weaknesses in the HACCP plan, and for failing to identify and address 238 the poor hygiene and unsafe food handling practices at the facility. In addition, utilizing 239 announced, as opposed to unannounced, inspections allowed the butcher to falsify 240 backlogged cleaning records before such records were due to be viewed by 241 environmental health officers (Pennington, 2009). 242  243  244 In Sept. 2006, 199 people were sickened and at least three died from consumption of 245 bagged spinach contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 and produced by Earthbound Farms 246 of California. Samples of river water, wild pig feces, and cattle feces from a nearby 247 grass-fed cattle operation tested positive for the outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 248 (California Food Emergency Response Team, 2007).  Following the outbreak it was 249 revealed that the suspect facilities had received a third-party audit of their good 250 agricultural practices (GAPs) from auditor Primus Labs that did not raise concerns for 251 the buyer, Dole Foods, to alter any purchasing decisions. This was the 29th documented 252 outbreak of foodborne illness involving leafy greens in the U.S. Despite decades of 253 letters and pleading by regulators to the industry to improve microbiological safety 254 standards, there was no verification that farmers and others in the farm-to-fork food 255 safety system were seriously incorporating and acting on risk reduction messages, 256 especially in production fields rather than just processing facilities (Powell et al., 2009). 257  258 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 7   259 4.0 Improving audits and inspections 260  261 Food safety auditors and inspectors are an integral part of the food safety system, and 262 their use will expand in the future, for both domestic and imported foodstuffs. 263 Supporters of third-party audits argue this type of audit augments the efforts of food 264 regulatory agencies, such as FDA, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and 265 others.  266  267 Auditing can be helpful, in theory. Audit reports, are only useful if the purchaser who 268 requires them reviews the results, understands the risks addressed by the standards 269 and makes risk-reduction decisions based on the results. From past examples, there 270 appears to be a disconnect between what auditors provide (a snapshot) and what 271 buyers believe they are doing (a full verification of product and process).  272  273 Third-party auditing can also assist regulatory agencies by providing the extra 274 assessment and data a regulatory agency might not be able to collect as often as 275 required \\u2013 but only if the data is shared with regulatory agencies. Audits and 276 inspections can assist in the development of a food safety culture by dictating criteria 277 for the sale of goods (Acheson, 2010). The training component for employees is another 278 use of audits in the daily implementation of food safety practices (AIB International, 279 2007). Third-party audits also provide \\u201cthousands of checks and balances to the food 280 supply system with no direct cost to taxpayers\\u201d (AIB International, 2007). However, 281 theory and practice can differ. 282  283 Critics see many problems with the general way third-party audits are currently 284 conducted and have described them as the equivalent of \\u201cmail-order diplomas\\u201d (Moss 285 & Martin, 2009).  As far as being the \\u201ceyes and ears\\u201d for a company buying from the 286 audited supplier, many problems are apparently missed during visits (Weise, 2010).  287 It is imperative for the food industry to aggressively take corrective actions and make 288 third-party audits and inspections more meaningful, more accurate, and to fully 289 enhance the safety of consumers. 290  291 In an effort to improve the third party audit system, FDA is working to establish 292 accreditation programs under a new food safety law, to insure the quality of audits 293 (Karst, 2011). FDA is also trying to make audit results accessible so they can analyze the 294 results for effectiveness and reliability (Karst, 2011). FDA released guidance for industry 295 in 2009 regarding voluntary third-party certification programs for foods and feeds 296 (FDA, 2009a). In this document, it is clearly stated that industry has the primary 297 responsibility to ensure that food products are safe and meet FDA requirements. The 298 document outlines recommendations for third-party certification programs such as 299 qualifications and training for auditors including coursework and field training. These 300 recommendations, though helpful, are not \\u201clegally established responsibilities\\u201d and the 301 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 8  extensive use of the word \\u201cshould\\u201d in the document infers a recommendation rather 302 than a requirement (FDA, 2009a). 303  304 Third-party audits are only one performance indicator and need to be supplemented 305 with microbial testing, second-party audits of suppliers and the in-house capacity to 306 meaningfully assess the results of audits and inspections. Any and all raw product 307 suppliers should be included in the audit scope. More effective audit systems 308 incorporate unannounced visits along with supplemental information into their 309 framework and require extensive documentation of internal audits, regulatory 310 compliance, laboratory results and raw product certifications. 311  312 Preventive measures such as instilling and enhancing a food safety culture, where there 313 are shared values throughout the organization that support risk-reduction, may 314 improve the safety of the food supply by supplying daily reminders, incentives and 315 food safety priorities in the absence of inspectors or auditors. Improving and 316 encouraging communication with front-line employees \\u2013 any food producer is only as 317 good as its worst front-line staff \\u2013 can help mitigate high-risk situations such as at PCA, 318 where employees said the facility was \\u201ca dump,\\u201d but did not report their concerns to 319 officials before people became ill and died (Sharp, 2009). Audits, regulatory inspections 320 and testing are an important part of the food safety system, but alone and individually 321 they are not enough.  322  323 Education and training are the focus of many food handling behavior interventions. 324 However, research suggests that the impacts of food handler training programs are 325 often inconsistent, and program evaluation is rarely conducted (Almanza & Nesmith, 326 2004; Egan et al., 2007; Frash et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 2008). Measuring knowledge 327 change is a poor indicator of changes in practices.  Yiannas (2008) points out the 328 limitations of focusing entirely on training as food safety culture indicators and 329 suggests training is just one factor of a good organization. Conscientious proprietors 330 provide training and proper tools, remove barriers, and proceed with a focus on 331 positive food safety behavior. The lack of food safety expertise within an organization 332 to effectively evaluate and interpret audit or inspection results may compound 333 problems. Standards applied by auditing firms and regulatory inspections often include 334 training as a component, but outbreak history suggests that little evaluation of 335 effectiveness is explored. 336  337 Researchers have suggested that the only reliable measure of effectiveness of food 338 safety culture-supporting intervention material is through the observation of food 339 preparation practices (Redmond and Griffith, 2003; Anderson et al., 2004; Redmond et 340 al., 2004; Chapman et al., 2010).   341  342 In 2010, beef processor JBS started a trial using video cameras as part of their third-343 party monitoring and auditing efforts (Crews, 2011). Strategically placed cameras 344 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 9  recorded footage that could then be observed by auditors around-the-clock and random 345 audits could then be conducted remotely. Not only does this allow for immediate 346 feedback, it has also proven an effective training tool for employees, as they can observe 347 and learn from watching themselves at work (Crews, 2011). Improvement at the pilot 348 plant was seen in days instead of months and compliance rates consistently exceeded 349 99%. Errors can be addressed almost immediately before problems develop (Crews, 350 2011).   351  352 Assessing food-handling practices of staff through internal observations, externally-led 353 evaluations, and audit and inspection results can provide indicators of a food safety 354 culture. Results of these evaluations can be used to modify interventions and further 355 improve the organization\\u2019s culture of food safety (Mitchell et al, 2007). 356  357 Since most commercial food establishments are audited or inspected, it remains likely 358 that any food establishment that becomes associated with a foodborne illness outbreak 359 will have had some type of audit in the past.  Audits provide only a snap-shot of 360 information and have inherent limitations based upon stakeholder involvement, 361 auditor competence, audit scope, and audit system.  362  363 In August 2008, Listeria monocytogenes-contaminated deli meats produced by Maple Leaf 364 Foods, Inc. of Canada caused 57 illnesses and 22 deaths (Weatherill, 2009). A panel of 365 international food safety experts convened by Maple Leaf Foods, Inc. to investigate the 366 source of the deli meat contamination determined that the most probable contamination 367 source was mechanical meat slicers that, despite cleaning according to the 368 manufacturer\\u2019s instructions, had meat residue trapped deep inside the slicing 369 mechanisms (Weatherill, 2009). An independent investigative review commissioned by 370 the Canadian federal government concluded that the focus on food safety was 371 insufficient among senior management at both the company and the various 372 government organizations involved before and during the outbreak; that insufficient 373 planning had been undertaken to be prepared for a potential outbreak; and that those 374 involved lacked a sense of urgency at the outset of the outbreak (Mason, 2009).  375  376 The specific plant linked to the outbreak received satisfactory marks from federal 377 inspectors for complying with federal regulatory requirements. They appeared to be 378 doing everything right. Employees consistently addressed instances of non-compliance 379 when they were identified. The plant\\u2019s management maintained all required records, 380 ensured that staff training took place, and ensured the established quality assurance 381 program was followed. At all plants, the company conducted environmental testing 382 that went beyond regulatory requirements (Weatherill, 2009).  Prior to the outbreak, 383 Maple Leaf Foods, Inc. conducted more than 3,000 environmental tests annually at the 384 implicated plant and tested products monthly (McCain, 2009). Although no product 385 tests revealed the presence of Listeria spp., a number of environmental samples detected 386 the bacteria in the months before the public was alerted in August to possible 387 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 10  contamination (CFIA, 2009; McCain, 2009). However, the company failed to recognize 388 and identify the underlying cause of a sporadic yet persistent pattern of environmental 389 test results that were positive for Listeria spp. and was not obliged to report these results. 390  391 Audit and inspection information must be leveraged into corrective actions in order to 392 mitigate risk.  However, the use of audits to help create, improve, and maintain a 393 genuine food safety culture holds the most promise in preventing foodborne illness and 394 safeguarding public health. 395  396 A common thread in all of the outbreaks described above is a clear lack of food safety 397 culture among the implicated companies. In the E. coli outbreak in South Wales, a 398 public inquiry into the outbreak by Professor Hugh Pennington (2009) found that, in 399 addition to allowing cross contamination through the operation\\u2019s single vacuum 400 packaging machine, butcher William Tudor encouraged ill employees to continue 401 working in establishments and preparing meat for sale. Upon review of statements 402 made by employees and environmental health officers to the police, of video and 403 photographic evidence, and of management documentation, Professor Chris Griffith 404 (2010), head of the food research and consultancy unit at the University of Wales 405 Institute, Cardiff, told the inquiry the culture at the premises was one of little regard for 406 the importance of food safety but where making and saving money was the priority. 407 Health code violations at the abattoir were longstanding, repetitive and widely known 408 among environmental health officers responsible for inspecting the operation Although 409 foodborne illness may not always be completely preventable, Griffith (2010) concluded 410 that the risk of a business causing foodborne illness is, to a large extent, a consequence 411 of its own activities. 412  413 Food safety culture, not only within the company but also within a supply chain should 414 also be emphasized.  In both the Odwalla and PCA outbreaks, second-party audits were 415 able to identify problems the third party auditors did not.  Open communication 416 between suppliers and buyers including expectations and risk management practices is 417 essential.  Systems where retailers work with their suppliers to help them achieve 418 objectives have had somewhat better buy-in from suppliers and may achieve better 419 results because they reinforce that culture. (Rains, 2009; Steir, 2009).  420  421 Third-party auditing is a business, where an organization or business pays another firm 422 to verify whether a supplier is following agreed-upon standards.  While third-party 423 auditors are not in the same position as regulatory inspectors with respect to policing an 424 industry \\u2013 they can provide information upon which buyers can make decisions. Based 425 on historic examples, audit results have not been well understood by requiring buyers 426 (Griffith, 2010; Schmit, 2009). It is incumbent on auditing firms and food businesses 427 commissioning audits to understand the strengths and limitations of any evaluation 428 process. Companies who blame the auditor or inspector for outbreaks of foodborne 429 illness should also blame themselves. 430 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 11   431 References 432 Acheson, D.

If conducted properly and the results acted upon, audits can reveal strengths and weaknesses in a food safety program, but cannot guarantee future performance. Further, auditors can only examine what a company provides, although skilled auditors know what to ask for and may be able to identify clues to systemic problems.   PCA outbreak, a federal team of investigators later uncovered a number of alarming signs at the peanut plant including testing records from the company itself that showed Salmonella in its products as far back as June 2007 (Martin, 2009) MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTReliance on an effective standard The audit is only as effective as the standard against which the practices are being measured. Standards must be evidence-based, designed to address the commodity/product specific risks and practices and responsive to changing industry practices and new science as it becomes available. Cantaloupe outbreak, July 2011. Previous research had focused on Salmonella and current industry standards may not be robust enough to address risk from Listeria.   Effective audit tool The audit tool (or audit checklist) must be valid. There is no scientific basis for certification/validation in audits (Mahshie, 2009). There is high variability in the quality and reliability of audits and many different types of audit tools that vary in length, complexity, and style. A firm may pass some audits but still have a food safety risk factor Salmonella in eggs, Iowa, 2010, lead to 2,000 illnesses and the recall of 500 million eggs. DeCoster received a superior rating from AIB International, despite audit reports that are typically 10-20 pages and consider over 300 elements (AIB International, 2007). Auditor competence Audits require more than just a checklist, they require paying attention and thinking. The individual ability of an auditor has a significant impact on the outcome of the audit, most third-party audits look for objective evidence to assess compliance, but effective auditors must be able to assess risk, particularly in unique situations and synthesize the information provided to determine effectiveness of the food safety management system In the aftermath of the PCA outbreak, the competency of both the auditor and the auditing firm were criticized. The auditor of the PCA facility was an experienced auditor but was an expert in fresh produce and was not aware that peanuts were susceptible to Salmonella (Moss and Martin, 2009) Audit scope The audit scope must be broad enough to cover all operations, locations and products. When a company is presented with different price quotes they often choose the cheapest one, which is more likely the one with less audit time (Pronk, 2011). This reduces cost for the firm requesting the audit, and reduces the ability of the auditor to see all parts of a complex operation as well as the possibility of the auditor finding instances of non-compliance. On June 28, 2007, Veggie Booty snack food was linked to an outbreak of Salmonella. The plant that made Veggie Booty had received a rating of \\u201cexcellent\\u201d from AIB International, raising questions about the efficacy of auditors and audits, which, in this case and others, did not extend to ingredient suppliers (Moss & Martin, 2009).  Conflict of Interest Almost all food producers/retailers require their suppliers to pay for their own audits. A company receiving a poor audit may be unwilling to hire that auditor again. Even with safeguards in place, auditing bodies still must rely on the honesty of their auditors to declare potential conflicts Follow-up Auditors have no legal authority and cannot demand records, embargo products or close an operation (Costa, 2011). Neither the auditor nor the audited company is required to report non-compliances, even automatic failures, to regulatory agencies. If the buyer does not review the audit report closely, which is often the case (Prevor, 2011a), they may never know that their supplier had a serious non-conformance.  \",\n",

Food safety technology can \\nincrease a company\\u2019s capacity to prevent a foodborne contamination. A food \\nsafety audit\\u2014a quality control tool in which an auditor observes whether a \\nplant\\u2019s processing practices and technologies are compatible with good food \\nsafety practices\\u2014can indicate how effectively food safety technology is \\nbeing used. Fast food restaurants, grocery stores, and other major customers \\nof meat and poultry processing plants conduct their own audits or hire audi-\\ntors to assess the soundness of a plant\\u2019s processing operation. Meat and \\npoultry plants also can audit themselves as a way to help maintain process \\ncontrol and as a marketing tool. In this report, we document the extent of \\nfood safety audits in U.S. meat and poultry processing plants and examine \\nthe association between the use of audits and plant size, firm structure, and \\nfood safety technology use. \\nWhat Were the Study Findings?\\n\\u2022\\tIn the poultry slaughter, cattle slaughter, and ready-to-eat products (e.g., \\nluncheon meats) industries, at least 90 percent of output is from audited \\nplants. \\n\\u2022\\tIn the hog slaughter, ground beef, and not-ready-to-eat products (e.g., \\nmeat cuts) industries, at least 70 percent of output is from audited plants. \\n\\u2022\\tMore than one-half of all plants were audited in the poultry slaughter \\nindustry. About one out of three cattle slaughter and hog slaughter plants \\nwere audited.\\n\\u2022\\tPlants with customer-hired or plant-hired auditors use significantly higher \\nlevels of food safety technology than plants without auditors. The most \\nnotable differences between plants using auditors and those not using \\nauditors were in the use of testing and equipment technologies, and the \\nsmallest differences were observed in sanitation practices. These results \\nhold within plant size categories.\\n\\u2022\\tThe use of double audits may indicate firms with the strongest incentives \\nto maintain food safety. Double-audit plants\\u2014those using both plant-hired \\nand customer-hired auditors\\u2014use greater food safety technology than \\nplants using only one audit type (either plant-hired or customer-hired). \\nThese results hold after controlling for plant size. \\n\\u2022\\tLarger plants and plants owned by multiplant firms are associated with a \\nsignificantly higher level of food safety technology use across all indus-\\ntries that were examined. \\nHow Was the Study Conducted?\\nFood safety technology use in six categories of meat and poultry plants\\u2014\\ncattle, hog, and poultry slaughter; ready-to-eat (e.g., luncheon meats); \\nnot-ready-to-eat (e.g., meat cuts); and ground beef\\u2014is examined using a \\ntechnology index developed by Ollinger, Moore, and Chandran (2004) and v \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nusing Tukey-Kramer comparison tests and other statistical tools. Six technol-\\nogies were examined: hide removal (dehiding), sanitation, operations, equip-\\nment, testing, and an overall measure. The data on the use of food safety \\ntechnologies are nationally representative and include information on 600 \\nslaughter plants and 700 processing-only meat and poultry plants collected \\nby RTI International for USDA\\u2019s Food Safety Inspection Service in 2004 and \\n2005. They are the most recent data available. 1 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nIntroduction\\nFood safety audits provide information about the efficacy of a plant\\u2019s food \\nsafety process control system at some point in time and are becoming \\nincreasingly important to the meat and poultry industry.1 Fast food restau-\\nrants, grocery stores, and other major customers of meat and poultry plants \\nuse audits to assess the soundness of a plant\\u2019s processing operation and often \\nrequire audits as conditions for granting a plant their business. Meat and \\npoultry plants use audits as a way to help maintain process control and also \\nas a marketing tool that could be useful for winning more business (Richard, \\n2003). By 2005, the use of auditors had become widespread. Some recent \\nfood safety incidents, however, have called into the question the usefulness \\nof audits. Moss and Martin (2009) and Harris (2010) reported that several \\nrecently audited plants had recalled millions of dollars worth of peanut, meat, \\negg, and other products.\\nThe 1993 outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in hamburgers served at Jack-in-\\nthe-Box restaurants led to a loss in net income for the restaurant company of \\naround $160 million over the 18 months following the outbreak (Roberts et \\nal., 1997). In response, Jack-in-the-Box imposed strict food safety standards \\non its suppliers and became a leader in the provision of food safety (Golan \\net al., 2004). Other restaurant chains, grocery stores, food manufacturers, \\nand other buyers also recognized the threat that an adverse food safety event \\ncould pose to their business. Thus, they developed their own food safety \\nprocess control programs and hired food safety auditors to evaluate their \\neffectiveness.\\nAudits may complement food safety technology. While the amount of invest-\\nment in food safety technology indicates a company\\u2019s commitment to food \\nsafety and also its capacity to prevent foodborne contamination, food safety \\naudits can indicate how effectively food safety technology is being used.\\nTo date, there has been little research on the use of audits and their relation-\\nship with food safety technology in meat and poultry plants. Although the \\nuse of auditors does not necessarily cause plants to use more food safety \\ntechnology or vice versa, an association may exist between the use of audi-\\ntors and food safety technology, particularly if plants using auditors are the \\ntypes of plants that make more extensive use of food safety investments or \\nif the forces encouraging the use of food safety auditors encourage the use \\nof food safety technologies. Our purpose in this paper is to (1) examine the \\nextent of food safety audit use, (2) see whether the use of audits varies with \\nplant size and across industries, and (3) evaluate whether the use of audits, \\nplant size, and firm type are associated with food safety technology use. \\nOur analysis relies on data from a 2004-05 national survey of meat and \\npoultry plants by RTI International for USDA\\u2019s Food Safety Inspection \\nService (FSIS) on the use of food safety technologies. Altogether, nearly 400 \\nmeat slaughter, more than 200 poultry slaughter, and almost 700 processing-\\nonly plants responded to a survey that was sent to a nationally representa-\\ntive sample of plants. The survey covered an extensive array of food safety \\ntechnologies. Some of these are more labor-intensive food safety tasks, such \\nas sanitation practices, and others are fixed assets, such as steam vacuum \\n1The terminology surrounding food \\nsafety audits can be confusing. In the \\ncertification literature, a first-party \\naudit is an audit performed within \\nthe meat or poultry plant by the plant \\nitself; a second-party audit is an audit \\nconducted by or on behalf of a purchas-\\ning organization, such as a grocery \\nstore chain or another meat or poultry \\nplant; a third-party audit is undertaken \\nby an independent certification body \\nthat certifies a process and has no ties \\nto either the customer or the supplier. In \\nthe trade literature, a third-party auditor \\nis often referred to as an auditor who \\nis not an employee of the plant or cus-\\ntomer. To avoid confusion, we do not \\nuse the first-, second-, and third-party \\naudit terminology.2\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nunits. The survey also gathered information on plant characteristics, such as \\nproduct inputs and outputs, plant size, and firm type. \\nWe measure plant food safety technology using an index that is constructed \\nfrom the food safety technology questions included in the RTI International \\nsurvey. There is one comprehensive measure of all technologies and separate \\nindexes for five technology types\\u2014hide removal (dehiding), sanitation, oper-\\nating practices such as disposal of scrap products (operations), equipment, \\nand testing. By using five specialized technology indexes that separate labor-\\nintensive food safety activities, such as sanitation, from capital-intensive food \\nsafety measures, such as equipment, we can better understand how types of \\ntechnologies vary with plant characteristics. Indexes were based on a more \\ncomprehensive assortment of food safety technologies than was available for \\nOllinger, Moore, and Chandran (2004). \\nWe next discuss food safety audits and then provide an economic framework \\nof how incentives provided by the private market (e.g., major customers) \\nencourage food safety. After that, we discuss the survey methodology, \\ndescribe the data in more detail, and present results of food safety expendi-\\ntures and technological choices in the context of our model.3 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nTypes of Audits and Reasons for Using Them\\nAudits of manufacturing plants are a systematic documentation of the \\nextent to which a plant meets specific standards established by the plant or a \\ncustomer. There are many types of audits, but most fall into these categories: \\nfood safety and good manufacturing practices (GMPs), hazard analysis and \\ncritical control points (HACCP) verification (including benchmarking and \\nconfirming a program), animal welfare, good laboratory practices (GLPs), \\nand quality systems. Auditors may also evaluate document management \\nsystems, pest control practices, water and hygiene controls, corrective and \\npreventive procedures, purchasing and vendor practices, system calibrations, \\nallergen controls, shipping and receiving procedures, education and training \\nsystems, and sanitation practices (Stier, 2009).\\nAudits indicate whether a plant is performing specified functions on a partic-\\nular day. There is no guarantee that the plant will be performing the same \\nway on other days, so it is important that audits be scheduled on a frequent \\nbut random basis. If the auditor comes at a predictable time, there is an incen-\\ntive for plant management to prepare for an audit.\\nAudits cover a prescribed set of activities or processes. Plants receive a \\nfavorable rating if they meet those standards. A favorable rating does not \\nmean that a plant produces safe food. A plant could be producing contami-\\nnated products, yet it could receive a good rating from its auditor. For \\nexample, if the auditor was only obligated to evaluate employee sanitation \\nand the auditor determined that employees properly washed their hands, then \\nthe plant would earn a good rating even if the plant was producing contami-\\nnated products. Cases like this have occurred. Michael Moss and Andrew \\nMartin (2009) indicated that Peanut Corporation of America produced \\nSalmonella-contaminated peanuts for many months even though the plant \\nreceived superior auditing scores from AIB International, an auditing \\ncompany. Lena Sun (2010) reported that Wright County Farms received a \\nsuperior rating from AIB shortly before its eggs sickened more than 1,800 \\npeople. Since the AIB auditors of these establishments did no product testing, \\nthe auditors could not evaluate product food safety, and, since the establish-\\nments satisfactorily performed activities needed to pass their audits, they \\nreceived superior grades.\\nAudit standards vary. Robert Brackett, former senior vice president of the \\nGrocery Manufacturers Association, asserted that some inspections can be \\nrigorous, particularly if they use internationally recognized private bench-\\nmarks (Sun, 2010). However, those audits are expensive and therefore not \\ncommonly done in the majority of U.S. meat and poultry plants.\\nThe effectiveness in improving food safety after an audit depends on \\nthe seriousness with which a plant takes the auditor\\u2019s recommendations. \\nPlant managers likely will implement an auditor\\u2019s recommendations if not \\nfollowing the recommendations poses a risk to their business, such as losing \\na potential contract. However, if a customer does not evaluate audit outcomes \\ncarefully and does not require a plant to make changes, then recommenda-\\ntions may or may not be followed. The Peanut Corporation of America \\napparently did not implement several important recommendations made by 4\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nauditors because the peanut processing plant\\u2019s customers failed to follow up \\non those recommendations by their own auditors (Moss and Martin, 2009).\\nAuditor Services and the Incentives To Use Them\\nLarge fast food restaurants, grocery store chains, and other large customers \\nof meat and poultry plants have recognized that they face considerable \\nmarket risks if they serve contaminated meat and poultry products. These \\nthreats have led some large customers to demand strong food safety measures \\nfrom their meat and poultry suppliers. A meat or poultry plant, on the other \\nhand, wants to reduce its costs as much as possible, so it has an incentive \\nto conduct only the minimum level of sanitation and process control. Since \\nthese two interests are at odds, the plant and its large customer may enter \\ninto a long-term contract in which the plant agrees to perform specified food \\nsafety tasks in exchange for an exclusive production agreement or a price \\npremium for its products. (Ollinger and Mueller, 2003; Golan et al., 2004). \\nA long-term contract does not completely resolve the conflict because the \\nactivities of plants are not observed by their customers. Customers cannot \\ndistinguish between contaminated meat and poultry and wholesome meat \\nor poultry when there is no outward sign of contamination such as an \\u201coff\\u201d \\nsmell or discoloration. As a result, major customers must either risk receiving \\ncontaminated meat or evaluate the food safety performance of their suppliers. \\nIf they choose to evaluate food safety performance, large customers can use \\ntheir own inhouse experts or hire meat and poultry food safety auditors. The \\nfrequency of the evaluations depends on the interests of the large customer.\\nAuditor services may be used in other situations as well. For example, a plant \\nmanager may use an auditor to assess the food safety integrity of the plant\\u2019s \\noperations. Below, we discuss four types of auditing arrangements.\\nTypes of Audits and Their Incentives\\nThere are four types of auditing arrangements that a plant may have:2\\n1. First, a plant may be subject to no audits. These plants likely serve \\ncustomers who do not demand audits and have managers who see \\nno need for audits. A manager may not use auditor services because \\naudits are costly and (1) a plant may be small enough that the manager \\ncan closely monitor operations or (2) the plant may never have had an \\nadverse food safety event and the manager may see no need to change, or \\n(3) the manager may not view food safety as a top priority. \\n2. The second auditing arrangement is when plants are subject to audits by \\ncustomers. These customers want to be sure that the meat or poultry they \\nbuy is safe and that their meat or poultry suppliers are meeting the food \\nsafety standards that they agreed to as part of a purchase contract. In this \\ncase, the auditor acts as an agent of the meat or poultry customer. Since \\nthe customer hires and pays the auditor, the incentives between the meat \\nor poultry customer and auditor are aligned and the auditor has a strong \\nincentive to report any deviations by a plant that are below the standards \\nof the customer.\\n2One might consider a different type \\nof audit in which auditors hired by \\na plant evaluate the performance of \\ncleaning crews hired as contractors by \\nthat plant. Presumably, respondents \\nto the survey would indicate whether \\nthe auditor was hired by the customer \\nor the plant and report accordingly. It \\nshould also be noted that USDA-FSIS \\nand USDA\\u2019s Agricultural Marketing \\nService (AMS) periodically conduct \\naudits as part of their regulatory \\nauthority. Since these are not initiated \\nby the private sector, they are neither \\nreported nor discussed here.5 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\n3. A third type of audit relationship is when a large meat or poultry \\ncustomer wants an audit but leaves it up to the plant to select the auditor. \\nHere plant management is an agent of the customer and the auditor is an \\nagent of the plant management. This type of relationship is complicated \\nbecause plant management hires the auditor. The plant could hire an \\nexperienced auditor that gives a fair assessment or it could hire a low-\\nskilled or less experienced auditor who is less able to identify deviations \\nfrom expected performance and is more likely to give a good report. \\nRegardless of which type of auditor is hired, an auditor should report \\nall observed deviations from generally accepted food safety practices. \\nHowever, this could create a conflict for the auditor because a negative \\nreport would look bad for the plant that hired the auditor and could cause \\nthe plant to deny the auditor any future business. Thus, the decision for \\nthe auditor is to weigh any benefits that may be achieved from giving \\na report that is more favorable to the plant against the costs of losing a \\ngood reputation for auditing services.\\n4. A fourth type of auditing arrangement is when plants hire their own audi-\\ntors. The plant could use the audit results to verify the effectiveness of \\ncomponents of its manufacturing process or its entire processing system. \\nIn this case, a plant would ask an auditor to review all or some of its food \\nsafety activities and could adjust all, some, or none of the processes that \\nan auditor cites as being deficient. Thus, a plant could have an audit and \\nthe audit could indicate that food safety activities that the auditor exam-\\nined met specified standards. Yet, a plant could have poor food safety \\nperformance because activities not evaluated by the auditor caused a \\nsystem failure.\\nPlant managers have the option to comply with audit findings and do so only \\nif it is profitable. Given similar findings, managers would be more likely to \\ncomply with audits as the costs of compliance drop, the value of the custom-\\ner\\u2019s purchase order rises, and the threat of a detectable food safety failure \\nrises.3 For example, a plant would likely comply with the auditor\\u2019s findings if \\nthe customer has a large order and the cost of complying with the audit report \\nis low. It would also likely comply if an audit reveals a serious food safety \\nbreach that could undermine the viability of a plant\\u2019s business. However, \\nif a customer has a small order and the costs of complying with the audit \\nare high, then a plant manager might not strictly comply with the auditor\\u2019s \\nfindings. \\nAudit Compliance and Audit Certification\\nCustomers and plants recognize the incentives existing in auditor-client rela-\\ntionships. Yet, no government or third party guarantees that a plant adhered \\nto the recommendations put forward by the auditor. Rather, it is up to the \\nbuyer to verify that auditor recommendations were followed. For buyers \\npurchasing large quantities of few inputs from a limited number of plants, \\nusing auditor services and verifying their effectiveness may be relatively low \\ncost. But, some buyers may purchase thousands of inputs or buy a few inputs \\nfrom a large number of plants, making it very costly to verify that auditor \\nrecommendations were followed.\\nThere is also no government or third-party agent that attests to the quality \\nof the auditor. Thus, certifications have become a particularly important \\n3Compliance costs are afffected by the \\nstrictness with which a customer may \\nhold plants to the audit findings. If \\nplants must strictly adhere to findings, \\nthen costs rise. If plants do not have to \\nstrictly meet audit requirements, then \\ncosts drop.6\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\ndevice for attesting to auditor skill. But, there are many certifications avail-\\nable, and their quality may depend on the quality and reputation of the certi-\\nfiers (Sun, 2010). Certifiers that are well-recognized professionals in their \\nfield or organizations, such as the Professional Animal Auditor Certification \\nOrganization, Inc., may offer greater assurance of auditor quality than less \\nwell-known certifiers. \\nLarge auditing firms and those with years of experience also can provide \\nsome reassurance about auditor quality because their reputations can be \\nevaluated. According to Kyle Yudis, an executive with Silliker, Inc., a large \\ninternational audit company, there are only about six large, international food \\nauditing companies and hundreds of small food auditing companies (Yudis, \\n2010). The larger companies may serve a range of customer needs, while \\nthe smaller companies tend to specialize in just one industry or one type of \\naudit.4 The larger auditing companies may employ their own auditors or use \\ncontractors.\\nNumber of Audits and the Incentives for Food Safety\\nIt may be difficult to distinguish the food safety performance of plants \\naudited by customer-hired auditors from the performance of plants audited \\nby plant-hired auditors. Both have a single-type of audit arrangement, and, \\nunder these single-audit arrangements, there is one party to the exchange \\nthat may not put a strong emphasis on food safety. Plants subject to audits \\nby customer-hired auditors but not by their own plant-hired auditor have \\ncustomers who place some value on food safety. If the plant chooses not \\nto have its own auditors, that suggests it sees no need for additional audit \\nrecommendations and verifications. Plants using only a plant-hired auditor \\nappear to be concerned about food safety or they wouldn\\u2019t have hired audi-\\ntors. But their customers do not demand these audits and, thus, would not \\nlikely encourage a plant to select a high-quality auditor and follow all audit \\nrecommendations.\\nDouble-audit plants (customer- and plant-hired auditors) likely have the \\nstrongest incentives to maintain food safety. These plants could have \\nparticularly cautious managers who hire auditors to inspect their operations \\nin order to ensure that their plants comply with their customers\\u2019 standards. \\nOr, double-audit plants could have buyers who require them to be audited \\nby particular auditors. Managers of double-audit plants may hire auditors \\nto evaluate aspects of their operations not adequately addressed by their \\ncustomers\\u2019 audits. Or, an audit may be used to determine whether a plant\\u2019s \\nprocedures meet acceptable standards. Regardless of the explanation, it \\nappears that double-audit plants may place a stronger emphasis on food \\nsafety than single-audit plants because both parties (customer and plant) \\ninvest in auditor services.\\n4According to Stier (2009), there are \\nmany types of food safety audits. These \\naudits may cover all or only part of a \\nplant\\u2019s entire food safety quality con-\\ntrol system. Some common food safety \\naudits are: Food Safety and Good \\nManagement Practices (GMPs) for \\nFood Processing Facilities; Food Safety \\nand GMPs for Distribution Centers; \\nHACCP Verification Audit (benchmark-\\ning and confirming a program); Animal \\nWelfare Audit; Good Laboratory Prac-\\ntices Audit; Quality Systems Audit; and \\nSafe Quality Food (SQF) Audit. All of \\nthese programs as well as auditors have \\nto have special types of certifications, \\ndepending on the type of food audited \\nand the type of audit performed.7 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nEconomic Framework\\nPlants pay for auditor services, perform cleaning and sanitation tasks, monitor \\nplant operations, conduct product testing, and make capital investments in \\nfood safety equipment in order to enhance food safety. These investments have \\ncost the meat and poultry industry millions of dollars (Ollinger, Moore, and \\nChandran, 2004). Yet, there is no evidence that consumers are willing to pay \\na higher price for food safety (i.e., for guarantees that meat or poultry has less \\nrisk of harmful pathogens). Li and Hooker (2009) found that firms have rarely \\nadvertised that a product was free of pathogens and that there was no signifi-\\ncant difference in price for firms that did advertise. Below, we examine why it \\nmay still be profitable for firms to invest in food safety. \\nWhy Plants Make Food Safety Investments and  \\nUse Auditor Services\\nThere are several factors motivating food safety investment. First, fear of \\nlost profitability and revenues due to product recalls may encourage firms to \\nuse food safety technologies. Thomsen and McKenzie (2001) found that that \\nfirms that recalled contaminated meat or poultry products suffered a decline \\nin long-run profitability. Piggott and Marsh (2004) and Marsh, Schroeder, \\nand Mintert (2004) determined that adverse food safety events led to tempo-\\nrary declines in meat and poultry consumption. Thomsen, Shiptsova, and \\nHamm (2006) established that sales of branded frankfurter products declined \\nmore than 20 percent after a product recall. Finally, McKenzie and Thomsen \\n(2001) found that recalls for E. coli O157:H7 resulted in a decline in prices \\nfor boneless beef. \\nPlants may also invest in food safety technology and audit services to support \\nan important brand. Shapiro (1983) showed that plants selling branded \\nproducts must support their brands with investments because their products \\nare readily identified by consumers and they want to convey an image of \\nhigh quality. Food safety investment is necessary to avoid brand destruction \\nthrough a product recall. Sara Lee, for example, suffered a large recall of \\nbranded hot dogs and was able to regain profitability in its branded hot dog \\nbusiness only after more than $70 million of investment in food safety and \\nmarketing (Auerswald, 1999).\\nPlants selling generic products, in contrast to those selling branded products, \\nsell products to buyers that resell or reprocess that product with identical \\nproducts from other suppliers, such that the producer of any single product \\ncannot be identified. Thus, the plant producing generic products may invest \\nless in food safety technology than plants selling branded products. All plants \\nmust invest in food safety technology up to a point that will enable them to \\nmeet USDA/FSIS or State regulatory standards.5 \\nOther factors encouraging food safety technology use by meat and poultry \\nslaughter and processing plants are purchase specifications and the fear \\nof lost business from fast food restaurants and other large customers. \\nCompliance with purchase specifications often requires the use of an array \\nof food safety technologies (Golan et al., 2004). Meat and poultry plants \\nwith contracts with large customers are always under a threat of a contract \\n5All meat or poultry plants must be \\ninspected by either the Federal or \\nState Government. Under the Code \\nof Federal Regulations (9 CFR Parts \\n321, 332, and 381 [Docket No. FSIS-\\n2008-0039] RIN 0583-AD37), select \\nState-inspected establishments have \\nthe option to ship meat and poultry \\nproducts, bearing an official USDA \\nmark of inspection, across State lines if \\nthey comply with all Federal standards \\nunder the Federal Meat Inspection \\nAct (FMIA) and the Poultry Products \\nInspection Act (PPIA). These establish-\\nments will receive inspection services \\nfrom State inspection personnel that \\nhave been trained in FMIA and PPIA \\nrequirements. State-inspected plants \\nnot among this select group of plants \\nare permitted to ship only within their \\nStates. All State inspection agencies \\nmust meet the same safety standards as \\nthese of federally inspected plants.8\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\ncancellation if a serious product recall occurs. Hudson Meat left the ground-\\nmeat business after Burger King, a major customer, cancelled its contract \\nfollowing a major recall of Hudson products (Winter, 2002). Likewise, \\nTopps Meat and Westland-Hallmark Meat companies also exited the beef \\nindustry after their products were subjected to recalls. \\nPlant Size and Firm Type, Food Safety Investment, and \\nthe Use of Auditors\\nThe threat of business losses due to product recalls, the need to support \\nbranded products, and compliance with customer specifications encourage \\nplants to make food safety investments and use auditor services. However, \\nplants must still reach maximum profitability. Thus, they minimize their \\ncosts under the constraints of making the food safety investments and using \\nthe auditor services that their markets demand.\\nFood Safety Technology and Auditor Use and Plant Size\\nCost minimizing behavior, different types of plant production technolo-\\ngies, and the food safety investments that plants must make to meet market \\ndemands suggests that plant-level food safety technology use may vary \\nacross plants. One determining factor in food safety technology use is the \\ncompatibility of a plant with different food safety technologies. Large plants \\nusing high-speed production lines must use high-speed food safety tech-\\nniques to ensure that production lines operate continuously and produce meat \\nand poultry that is free of harmful pathogens. Small cattle slaughter plants \\nthat butcher only a few animals per day may obtain the same level of food \\nsafety by closely monitoring operations and thoroughly cleaning plant facili-\\nties. Thus, small and large plants likely make different types and amounts of \\nfood safety investments.\\nTechnological compatibility is important, but there are other reasons why \\nlarger plants may have a greater incentive to make food safety investments \\nand use auditor services than smaller plants. First, large plants may have \\nmuch greater cash flow and access to credit than small plants, and this greater \\naccess may enable them to purchase equipment more easily. Second, large \\nplants have much more to lose in the event of a serious food safety failure. \\nFor example, assume that a plant can be sold for the value of its fixed invest-\\nments, contracts, and goodwill and 50 percent of the value of firm is due \\nto fixed investment and 50 percent is due to contracts and goodwill. Now \\nsuppose that there are two plants\\u2014one valued at $1 million and one valued \\nat $1 billion\\u2014and that each loses its reputation for food safety. If the loss of \\na reputation for food safety causes all goodwill to vanish, then the smaller \\nplant loses $500,000 and the larger plant loses $500 million. Thus, a large \\nplant would be willing to invest more in food safety technology and auditor \\nservices than would a smaller plant. \\nThird, large plants may also have lower costs of using auditor services and \\nsome food safety technologies. Auditor services and carcass pasteurizing \\nand other modern food safety equipment are expensive fixed costs, but large \\nplants can spread theses fixed costs over more units of output than a small \\nplant can, resulting in a lower cost per pound of output. For example, assume \\na large cattle slaughter plant processes 1 million pounds of meat per day 9 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nwhile a small plant processes 1 million pounds in a year, and that each plant \\nchooses to pasteurize cattle carcasses with a steam pasteurizer costing $1 \\nmillion in capital expenditures. If each plant must pay for equipment within \\n1 year, then the cost per pound for the large plant is less than one-half cent \\nper pound while that for the small plant is about $1 per pound.6 In addition, \\nspecialization of labor may enable large plants to gain more expertise about \\nfood safety technologies. This expertise may make them more prone to use \\nfood safety technologies than would a smaller plant.\\nGreater use of some food safety technologies and auditor services at large \\nplants than at small plants does not mean that output from large plants there-\\nfore is safer. Small plants have an incentive to provide robust food safety if \\nthe markets they serve require it. Some small plants serve niche markets that \\nlink plants with products. By contrast, large plants with no pressure from \\ncustomers and selling generic products on the spot market may feel little \\nneed to invest in food safety because their products may not be easily identi-\\nfied, especially once they have been reprocessed or labeled further down the \\nsupply chain.\\nSmall plants realize their own advantages in maintaining food safety. Most \\nimportantly, they have more operational flexibility than do large plants. If a \\nsmall plant has food safety problems, managers can slow production lines \\nand address those problems with little lost production time. Moreover, sanita-\\ntion and operations\\u2014two fundamental food safety technologies that all plants \\nmust maintain\\u2014tend to be scale-neutral (i.e., a plant with twice as much \\noutput as another plant may have to devote twice as much effort to sanitation \\nand operations). Thus, smaller plants emphasizing sanitation in all their oper-\\nations and maintaining constant vigilance over food safety process control \\nmay reach the same level of food safety as a large plant using complex food \\nsafety equipment. \\nA small plant may have less need for an auditor. Small plants are often \\nmanaged directly by owners, who have a strong incentive to maintain food \\nsafety in order to avoid a loss of business as well as a blow to their personal \\nreputations. Moreover, these plants have less complex operations, making \\nthem easier to monitor. \\nSingle- and Multi-Plant Firms and Food Safety Investment\\nFirms that own more than one plant (multiplant firms) may be more likely to \\nhave audits and make food safety investments than single-plant firms. First, \\nthe expected losses at a multiplant firm may be higher than at a single-plant \\nfirm. Suppose, similar to a previous hypothetical example, 50 percent of the \\nvalue of firm is due to fixed investment and 50 percent is due to contracts \\nand goodwill. Now suppose that there are three plants producing the same \\nproduct and each plant is valued at $100 million and that one firm owns two \\nplants and the other firm owns one plant. If both firms lose their reputations \\nfor food safety, then the single-plant firm loses $50 million and the two-plant \\nfirm loses $100 million. Thus, multiplant firms would be willing to invest \\nmore in auditor services and food safety technology than single-plant firms.\\nFirms that own more than one plant may have lower costs of implementing \\nfood safety technologies. Firms experience a learning curve when adopting \\n6 This is a simple hypothetical example, \\nnot intended to be factually correct. Ac-\\ntual costs to these two types of plants \\nwould be very different than those ex-\\npressed here. However, the example is \\nvalid since there still would be a large \\ndifference in costs.10\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nmore advanced technology, enabling multiplant firms to install and imple-\\nment new technologies in other plants at a lower cost after they have already \\nused it in one plant. This may be why Dunne (1994) found that multiplant \\nfirms were more likely to invest in manufacturing technologies than single-\\nplant firms. \\nSummary\\nDue to their size, large plants find it necessary to invest more in high-speed \\nfood safety technologies to provide the food safety they need to meet their \\ncustomers\\u2019 demands. They also may suffer a greater financial loss than \\nsmall plants if they have a food safety failure, have lower per-unit cost of \\nfood safety fixed-cost investments, and may have lower financing costs. \\nThus, it is no surprise that Dunne (1994) found that larger plants were more \\nlikely to adopt new manufacturing technologies and Ollinger, Moore, and \\nChandran (2004) and Muth (2002) found that large meat and poultry plants \\nmake greater use of food safety technology than small plants do. For similar \\nreasons, firms that own more than one plant may make greater use of food \\nsafety technology and auditor services than single-plant firms.\\nOur discussion of audit arrangements and food safety performance suggests \\nthat single-audit plants (customer- or plant-hired auditors) may emphasize food \\nsafety less than double-audit type plants (customer- and plant-hired auditors). \\nSimilarly, a single-audit plant may emphasize food safety more than a no-audit \\nplant of a similar size. Economic theory suggests that if a plant values food \\nsafety higher, then it will invest more in food safety, suggesting an association \\nbetween auditor use and food safety technology use.7 Thus, we expect food \\nsafety technology levels to be higher for double-audit plants than for single-\\naudit plants and for audit plants than for no-audit plants.\\n7Ollinger and Moore (2009) showed \\nthat food safety technology negatively \\naffects Salmonella levels in meat and \\npoultry products, suggesting that \\nprocessors who place a higher value on \\nfood safety invest more in food safety \\ntechnology.11 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nSurvey Techniques and the Data\\nPlant data on self-reported food safety technologies and practices were \\nobtained from a national survey of Federal and State-inspected meat \\nslaughter, poultry slaughter, and processing-only plants. The survey was \\nsponsored by FSIS and conducted by RTI International in 2004 for meat and \\npoultry slaughter plants and in 2005 for processing-only plants. The analysis \\ndescribed in this report focuses on federally inspected plants.8\\nA detailed description of the multimodal survey approach used for adminis-\\ntering the surveys is given in Cates et al. (2005, 2006). The survey instrument \\nand study design were approved under the U.S. Office of Management and \\nBudget\\u2019s information collection clearance process. A brief overview of the \\nsampling methods, questionnaire development, survey administration, and \\nanalysis procedures is given in appendix A. \\nThe analyses compare large and small plants. We defined large plants as \\nthose plants falling in the top quintile of volume of production (80-99 percen-\\ntile) and the small plants as those falling in the bottom quintile (0-19 percen-\\ntile). The distributions of plants by quintile and total numbers of plants for \\neach of the six analysis categories are provided in table 1. \\nVariable Measurement\\nThere are four types of variables used in the analysis: an indicator for each of \\nthe four types of audits, whether the plant was owned by a single- or multi-\\nplant firm, plant size, and food safety technology. Our measures of plant \\naudit type were taken directly from the survey and include one no-audit, \\ntwo single-audit, and one double-audit types. Single-audit plants have either \\naudits sponsored by customers or audits sponsored by the plant or the parent \\n(owner) of the plant. Double-audit plants have audits by both customers and \\nthe plant.\\n8Virtually all State-inspected plants are \\nin the very small size category, with \\nnine or fewer employees.\\nTable 1   \\nPlants in each size quintile by type\\nSize percentiles (ranked by pounds of output) Total \\nnumber  Plant type 0\\u201319 20\\u201339 40\\u201359 60\\u201379 80\\u201399\\n------------------------Number of plants------------------------\\nSlaughter1\\n Cattle slaughter 52 53 53 53 53 264\\n Hog slaughter 51 52 51 52 51 257\\n Poultry slaughter 40 41 41 41 41 204\\nProcessing only \\n RTE products 32 33 32 33 32 162\\n NRTE products 42 42 44 42 41 211\\n Ground beef 15 16 17 13 18 79\\n1Slaughter industries includes plants that only slaughter animals (i.e., slaughter-only plants) and \\nplants that both slaughter animals and process raw meat.\\nRTE=Ready To Eat.\\nNRTE=Not Ready To Eat.\\nSource: USDA, Economic Research Service and RTI calculations.12\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nThe measure of whether the plant was owned by a single- or multiplant \\nfirm was taken from a survey question asking whether a plant has a parent \\ncompany that owns other plants. Plant size is based on pounds of produc-\\ntion per year and was calculated by summing responses to the volume ques-\\ntions in the surveys.9 There were 74 meat slaughter and 16 poultry slaughter \\nplants that did not give production volumes. For these plants, we calculated \\nestimated values based on 2004 slaughter volumes obtained from FSIS\\u2019s \\nAnimal Disposition Reporting System. Since output is reported in animals \\nslaughtered in this dataset, we converted animals slaughtered to their weight \\nequivalent. We did this by multiplying the number of animals slaughtered \\ntimes the average dressed weight of that animal. Output volumes for poultry \\nspecies were defined as the number of birds slaughtered times the average \\nlive weight times the average dressing percentage. Average dressed (carcass) \\nweights, live weights, and dressing percentages for meat species in 2004 \\nwere obtained from USDA/ERS Red Meat Yearbook; average live weights \\nfor poultry species in 2004 were obtained from USDA/National Agricultural \\nStatistical Service Poultry Yearbook; and, average dressing percentages for \\npoultry were obtained from USDA/Agricultural Marketing Service Market \\nNews for the week ending November 1, 2008. Dressing percentages for 2008 \\nwere used because estimates were not available for 2004.10 Note that for \\ntwo meat slaughter plants, slaughter volumes for 2004 were not available, so \\nwe used their 2003 volumes. Furthermore, for five poultry slaughter plants, \\nslaughter volumes for 2004 were not available, so we used 2003 volumes \\n(four plants) or 2002 volumes (one plant).\\nConstruction of a Food Safety Technology Index\\nWe constructed a food safety technology index based on a methodology \\ndiscussed in an earlier ERS report (Ollinger, Moore, and Chandran, 2004). \\nThis technology index is grounded on the idea that food safety process \\ncontrol is a system in which plants marshal several different types of equip-\\nment and practices to maintain process control\\u2014 produce meat or poultry \\nthat is free of harmful contaminants.\\nIt is more precise to compare similar technologies and production practices \\nacross plants (e.g., equipment of one plant to equipment of another) rather \\nthan an overall system of food safety that includes a mixture of technolo-\\ngies and practices. Thus, we created five food safety technology indexes that \\ncorrespond with questions in the survey. These five technologies are:\\n\\u2022\\tDehiding/slaughter (cattle and hog slaughter only)\\u2014method of removing \\nthe hide from (dehiding) carcasses, sanitizing practices and frequencies \\nin the slaughter areas, and whether a plant requires its animal suppliers to \\nmeet pathogen-control standards.\\n\\u2022\\tSanitation\\u2014sanitizing practices and frequencies in the further processing \\nareas and removal of biomatter.11\\n\\u2022\\tOperations\\u2014use of written policies and procedures for recalls, tracking \\nproducts backward and forward, whether a plant requires its meat \\nsuppliers to meet pathogen-control standards, employee food safety \\ntraining, use of dedicated manager and staff for food safety activities, etc.\\n9For meat slaughter, the volume ques-\\ntions were 1.5 and 2.12. For poultry \\nslaughter, the volume questions were \\n1.5 and 2.11; see: http://www.fsis.usda.\\ngov/PDF/SRM_Survey_Slaughter_&_\\nProcessing_Plants.pdf/. For processing-\\nonly plants, the volume questions were \\n1.12 through 1.15; see: http://www.fsis.\\nusda.gov/PDF/SRM_Survey_Meat_&_\\nPoultry_Processing_Only_Plants.pdf /.\\n10The meat species and carcass weight \\nare: steers\\u2013806 pounds, heifers\\u2013740 \\npounds, cows\\u2013614 pounds, bulls\\u2013893 \\npounds, veal calves\\u2013201 pounds, bar-\\nrows and gilts\\u2013196 pounds, sows\\u2013313 \\npounds, boars\\u2013220 pounds, sheep\\u201366 \\npounds, lambs\\u201369 pounds, goats\\u201325 \\npounds, and other meat species\\u2013684 \\npounds (assumed bison).

It \\nincludes cutting, deboning, trimming, \\ngrinding, cooking, and other process-\\ning areas.

For \\nexample, plants with more intensive cleaning or that use a specific piece of \\nfood safety equipment should have higher scores than plants with less inten-\\nsive cleaning or without the same piece of equipment. Second, comparisons \\nshould be made for technology types (see earlier discussion). Third, since \\nfood safety quality control requires a systematic approach, a variety of tech-\\nnology components within each technology type should be considered. For \\nexample, steam vacuum units, carcass pasteurizers, and various sanitizing \\nsprays are important technologies, included in the overall and equipment \\nindexes, and considered by meat experts as components of an effective \\nprocess control system.\\nConstruction of the index followed several general procedures that are \\ndescribed in appendix B and lead to an index that ranges from 0 to 1. That \\ndiscussion can be summarized as follows. If plants do not use a type of food \\nsafety equipment or procedure, they were assigned 0 points for that tech-\\nnology, and, if the procedure or equipment is used, then they were assigned \\n1 point. If plants used an intermediate level of a procedure or task, then point \\nvalues falling between 0 and 1 were assigned. For example, if the options \\nfor cleaning were once per week, once per day, once per shift, or once per \\nhour and the plant chose once per shift, then it would be assigned a number \\nbetween 0 and 1e. After assigning values, all assigned values were added \\ntogether and the resulting sum was divided by the total number of questions \\nused to create that particular index (e.g., sanitation). Appendix table B1 gives \\nthe survey questions supporting each technology index for each technology \\ntype for the cattle, hog, and poultry slaughter and processing industries and \\nall processing-only plants. 14\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nData Discussion \\nTables 2, 3, and 4 present pounds of output by plant size and type of industry \\nand type of outside auditor.12 Table 2 shows that the largest plants are very \\nmuch larger than the smallest plants when measured in terms of pounds of \\noutput. Cattle and hog slaughter plants in the top quintile produced more \\nthan 10,000 times more pounds of output than competitors in the bottom \\nquintile. Plants in the top quintile in other industries were between 100 and \\n1,000 times larger in terms of pounds of output than their competitors in the \\nbottom quintile. Notice also that slaughter plants in the top quintile were \\n15-45 times larger in terms of output than the largest processing-only plants, \\nbut cattle and hog plants in bottom quintiles were about the same size as the \\nprocessing-only plants. Finally, poultry plants in all quintiles are larger than \\ntheir counterparts in other industries.\\nTables 3 and 4 show auditing practices by quintile. More than 80 percent \\nof plants in the top quintile of each industry were subject to audits of any \\ntype, while from 55 to 90 percent of plants in the bottom quintile of each \\nindustry had no audits. The majority of plants in the top quintile of all but the \\nnot-ready-to-eat (NRTE) industry were double-audit plants (i.e., used both \\ncustomer-hired and plant-hired auditors). Most plants in the bottom quintile \\nof each industry had no audits, and a majority of plants in the bottom three \\nquintiles in all industries except poultry slaughter were no-audit plants.\\nAppendix table B1 shows that cattle and hog slaughter plants in the top quin-\\ntiles were mainly single-species plants (i.e., either cattle-only or hog-only); \\n12Appendix tables B2-B4 show the \\nnumber of animals slaughtered by in-\\ndustry and plant size and output shares \\nby industry and size.\\nTable 2   \\nSlaughter and processing industries: Output per plant per industry quintile1\\nPlant size quintile (ranked by pounds of output)\\nPlant type 0\\u201319 20\\u201339 40\\u201359 60\\u201379 80\\u201399\\n----------------------------Mean pounds per plant----------------------------\\nSlaughter1\\n Cattle slaughter 28, 042 157,808 508,319 3,328,599 317,592,240\\n Hog slaughter 23,999 137,691 445,834  2,717, 570 293,875,382\\n Poultry slaughter 4,405,970 66,701,669 151,698,487 228,093,237 450,675,247\\nProcessing only \\n RTE products 13,125 132,273 651,563  7,966,818 22,262,813\\n NRTE products 22,024 126,310 550,114  3,680,952 13,292,927\\n Ground beef 30,667 196,875 752,059  5,038,462 11,358,056\\nNotes: Mean pounds for slaughter were calculated by multiplying number of head slaughtered by average carcass \\nweight pounds (lbs) per head as reported in USDA\\u2019s Red Meat Yearbook and Poultry Yearbook for 2004.

In contrast, \\nthree-fourths of the output of plants in the bottom quintile consisted of raw \\nground meat and processed products. Plants in the top and bottom quintiles \\nof the other industries had similar output mixes. Poultry plants in all quin-\\ntiles produced mainly raw, not ground products; half the output of plants of \\nall quintiles in the ready-to-eat (RTE) industry was fully cooked, not shelf \\nstable products; plants of all quintiles in the NRTE industry produced a mix \\nof output; plants of all quintiles in the ground beef industry produced mainly \\nraw ground meat.\\nResults \\nWe examine differences in statistical means of the technology index across \\nfive size categories of plants, two firm types (whether the plant is a part of \\na single-plant or multiplant firm), four audit types, and five plant sizes and \\ntwo audit types. We do pair-wise means tests for comparisons of two groups \\n(e.g., single-plant versus multiplant firms). However, a different statistical \\ntest is required when there are more than two groups (e.g., comparisons of \\ntechnology use across the five groups (quintiles) in table 5). It can be shown \\nthat a positive (significant) outcome is more likely if there are more compari-\\nsons. A Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test is used in this study to \\nadjust for the tendency to have false positives in series of pair-wise statistical \\ntests. This multiple comparison test requires a stronger level of evidence for \\nan individual comparison to be deemed \\u201csignificant\\u201d than would a series of \\npair-wise means tests. Although there are other multiple comparison tests, \\nthe Tukey-Kramer method is most appropriate for our case because the data \\nare unbalanced (SAS manual, p. 2,514, 2009).13 \\nFood Safety Technology Indexes and Plant Characteristics\\nPlant size \\nTable 5 shows that the food safety technology indexes increase with size \\nand that there are sharp differences between plants in the top and bottom \\npercentiles in the cattle and hog slaughter industries. In both industries, the \\ntechnology index values were about one-third larger for plants in the top \\nquintile relative to those in the bottom quintile. Based on the Tukey multiple \\ncomparison test, the index values for plants in the top cattle slaughter quintile \\nwere significantly larger than the index values for plants in the other four \\nquintiles for all but the sanitation index (p<0.01). For sanitation, the index \\nvalue for plants in the top quintile was significantly larger (p<0.05) compared \\nto only plants in the bottom two quintiles.

We also \\nfind (1) that double-audit plants (at least one auditor hired by customer and \\none hired by plant) had higher index values than both no- and single-audit \\nplants for all technologies except sanitation and operations, (2) single-audit \\nplants (at least one auditor hired by either customer or plant) generally had \\nhigher index values than no-audit plants for all technologies except sanita-\\ntion and operations, and (3) large plants and plants owned by multiplant firms \\nhave higher food safety technology indexes than their small and single-plant \\ncompetitors.\\nThis work both updates and extends earlier work by Ollinger, Moore, and \\nChandran (2004) by showing that plant size is correlated with a food safety \\ntechnology index at a different point in time (2004 versus 2001) and by \\nshowing that the technology indexes are correlated with food safety audits. \\nIt is interesting to observe that the sanitation index is higher only for audited \\nversus unaudited plants in the cattle and hog slaughter industries and not \\nother industries. We attribute this outcome to FSIS\\u2019s regulatory focus. FSIS \\nstresses cleaning and sanitation, but mandates very little fixed investment \\nand testing. This regulatory focus on sanitation may reduce the marginal \\nimprovements achievable through even more sanitation but may not affect \\nthe gains from other food safety technologies and practices. Thus, managers \\nmay be making discretionary food safety investments in non-sanitation tech-\\nnologies\\u2014operations, equipment, testing, and dehiding\\u2014since those technol-\\nogies (1) may provide greater marginal improvement in food safety process \\ncontrol and (2) may offer a wider range of practices and technologies that can \\nbe used.\\nIt is very important to remember that, since univariate methods were used \\nin the analysis, we did not control for other factors affecting the use of food \\nsafety technologies. Thus, the results provide some, but not complete confi-\\ndence of an association between a technology index and a group of plants \\nclassified by their size, firm type, and audit arrangements.15\\n15 Survey responses were self-reported \\nby the plant, which increases the likeli-\\nhood of receiving biased information, \\nparticularly since the survey was con-\\nducted for FSIS, a regulatory agency. \\nHowever, we believe most of the data \\nare accurate because (a) the question-\\nnaire stated that the responses would be \\nkept confidential, (b) the questionnaire \\nsaid that only aggregated information \\nwould be provided to FSIS, and (c) \\nmost of the questions dealt with the use \\nof technologies and not more sensitive \\ninformation. It was not within the scope \\nof the study to verify the responses \\nthrough onsite visits or other methods.27 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nReferences\\nAuerswald, Beth A. 1999. \\u201cRestocking the Shelves: Recovering from a \\nRecall,\\u201d Food Quality.

The sampling frame was a Food Safety and Inspection \\nService, USDA,  database of Federal and State-inspected plants that \\ncontains plant-level information on production volume, annual revenue, \\nnumber of employees, inspection activities, and contact information from \\nvarious USDA sources. All commercial plants that currently slaughter meat \\nspecies (cattle, swine, lamb, goat, and other meat species) or poultry species \\n(chicken, turkey, and other poultry species) were included in the sampling \\nframe for the slaughter surveys. All commercial plants that do not slaughter \\nbut conduct further processing of meat and poultry were included in the \\nsampling frame for the processing-only survey. Custom-exempt plants were \\nexcluded.16 The sample was stratified by inspection status (Federal versus \\nState) and hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) size (very \\nsmall, small, and large) as follows:\\n\\u2022\\tlarge plants have 500 or more employees, \\n\\u2022\\tsmall plants have 10 or more employees but fewer than 500, and \\n\\u2022\\tvery small plants have fewer than 10 employees or less than $2.5 million \\nin annual sales.\\nThe sample design specified a sample size that was expected to yield preci-\\nsion of +/\\u20135 percent or better for estimates of all proportions. For federally \\ninspected plants, a systematic sample of very small plants and a census of \\nsmall and large plants were included.17\\nQuestionnaire Development. The questionnaire was designed to collect \\ninformation on the use and frequency of sanitation practices, use of specific \\nfood safety technologies and practices, use and types of microbiological \\ntesting, food safety training procedures, response to the bovine spongiform \\nencephalopathy (BSE) interim final rules by beef packing plants, and plant \\ncharacteristics (e.g., age, size, and number of shifts). Plants were asked to \\nprovide information on their activities during the past year. The slaughter \\nsurveys were administered in 2004, and the processing-only survey was \\nadministered in 2005. Before administering the survey, the questionnaires \\nwere reviewed by trade associations and pretested with a small number of \\nplants.\\nSurvey Administration. A variety of procedures aimed at maximizing the \\nsurvey response rate were used, including many of the procedures recom-\\nmended by Dillman (2000). Before the start of data collection, several \\nindustry trade organizations sent an e-mail message to their membership or \\nposted information in their newsletter and on their website that described the \\nsurvey and encouraged their participation. Sampled plants were contacted \\nby telephone to identify the plant manager and then mailed a letter on \\nFSIS letterhead that described the upcoming survey. Plant managers were \\ncontacted by telephone to screen for eligibility and to identify the target \\nrespondent for the survey (if not the plant manager). The self-administered \\nquestionnaire was delivered via Federal Express followed by a thank you/\\nreminder postcard. Respondents completed the mail questionnaire and \\nsent it back to RTI for keying. Those who did not respond were reminded \\n16Custom-exempt plants can only \\nslaughter and process livestock for the \\nexclusive use of the owner.\\n17Systematic sampling ensures that the \\nselected sample represents the popula-\\ntion by forcing the sample to include \\nplants with varying characteristics, \\nsuch as geographic location and type of \\nspecies.31 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nthrough a series of telephone calls, and the questionnaire was remailed to \\nnonrespondents. \\nThe numbers of respondents and response rates for each of the surveys are \\nprovided in appendix table A1.\\nFrom each of the survey datasets, we created analysis datasets to focus on \\ncategories of interest as follows:\\n\\u2022\\tFor cattle slaughter plants, the original dataset included 384 federally \\ninspected plants that slaughtered hooved animals. Plants that slaughtered \\nonly veal calves (4 plants), only cows and bulls (12 plants), or only other \\nmeat species were excluded, resulting in a final dataset of 264 plants that \\nslaughtered steers and heifers. Plants that also slaughtered hogs in addition \\nto steers and heifers were retained in the dataset.\\n\\u2022\\tFor hog slaughter plants, the original dataset included 384 federally \\ninspected plants that slaughtered hooved animals.

First, we grouped similar tech-\\nnologies and practices into one of the five types of food safety practices and \\ntechnologies described above. Second, we valued all questions equally with a \\nmaximum value of 1 and a minimum value of 0. Third, we assigned the most \\nintensive operation within each question a value of 1 and the least intensive \\na value of 0. For example, equipment usage questions and similar questions \\nhad just two possible responses: 1 or 0. Many sanitation and plant operations \\nquestions, however, had multiple choices. For these questions, we assigned \\na 1 to operations that generate the most food safety, a 0 to operations gener-\\nating the least food safety, and an intermediate value between 0 and 1 for \\noperations providing intermediate food safety performance. Intermediate \\nvalues could have been chosen on a linear, logarithmic, or some other mono-\\ntonic scale. We assumed a linear relationship. Thus, if five response choices \\nwere provided, then values would be in fourths (0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and \\n1.0) and, if four response choices were given, then values would be thirds \\n(0.0, 0.33, 0.67, 1.0).\\nFinally, we created a technology index for each technology category by \\nsumming the values of the responses for each of the questions within that \\ncategory\\u2014plant equipment, testing procedures, plant operations, sanitation, \\nand dehiding\\u2014and dividing by the number of questions, yielding an index \\nvalue between 0 and 1. For the overall technology category, we divided the \\ntotal of all technology questions by the total number of food safety tech-\\nnology questions. Examples of the index are given in Ollinger, Moore, and \\nChandran (2004)\\nAlthough we tried to create as precise an index as possible, it is important to \\nrecognize that the index is not exact. First, we chose a linear scale to weigh \\nintermediate survey questions. Second, all pathogen-control activities within \\na category were assumed to be of equal importance. For example, sanitizing \\nknives is of equal importance to washing hands and each of those is equal \\nto the use of a steam vacuum unit. But, it may be that sanitizing knives is \\nmore important than washing hands and the steam vacuum units, in which \\ncase knife sanitation should have a heavier weight. Third, the five tech-\\nnology categories may not be of equal importance. For example, it may be \\nthat sanitation and cleaning is more important than equipment. To partially \\naccommodate this concern, we emphasize the categorical (e.g., index of 34\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\npathogen-control equipment) rather than the overall pathogen-control plant \\nrating in our discussion. \\nFourth, several procedures employed in order to make a survey response \\nusable may have influenced the final index values:\\n\\u2022\\tA value of 0 for binary responses and the midpoint value for frequency \\nresponses (responses with more than a 0/1 choice, such as a scale) were \\nassigned if the question had a missing response that was not attributed to \\na skipped question.

Published by Innovare Academic Sciences Pvt Ltd. This is an open-access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) \\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.22159/ijap.2019v11i1.29709 \\n \\nINTRODUCTION \\nAudits are conducted to ascertain the validity and reliability of the \\ninformation; also to provide an assessment of the internal control of a \\nsystem. It provides management with information on the efficiency with \\nwhich the company controls the quality of its processes and products [1]. \\nThe audit in simple terms could be defined as the inspection of a \\nprocess or a system to ensure that it meets the requirements of its \\nintended use [2]. International organization for standardization \\n(ISO) defines the audits as \\\"Systematic, independent and \\ndocumented process for obtaining audit evidence and evaluating \\nthem objectively to determine the degree to which the verification \\ncriteria are met\\\" [3]. \\nInstead of considering the audit as an intrusive and potentially \\nthreatening review, pharmacies should consider the audit as a \\nquality control mechanism. The results of the audit and the resulting \\ncorrective actions ensure all the involved parties that a program \\nworks in accordance with established rules of practice [4]. \\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, audits are virtual means for \\nassessing compliance with the established objectives defined in the \\nquality system and thus paving the way for the continuous \\nimprovement program by providing feedback to management [2]. A \\ncompany that produces drugs today must be able to demonstrate \\nthat it does so with absolute reliability, in optimal conditions and \\nwith extreme uniformity that allows accurate reproduction [1]. \\nIn food and drug administration (FDA) and ISO environments, \\nauditing of both compliance and performance is essential. \\nPharmaceutical audit experience includes the drafting and revision \\nof validation policies, guidelines and standard operating procedures \\n(SOP) from project qualification to performance evaluation phases \\n[1]. If implemented correctly; it can be one of the most effective \\nmeans of improvement [5]. \\nDefinition of internal audit \\nThe chartered institute of management accountants, UK (CIMA) \\ndefines Internal Audit as:  \\n\\u2018An independent appraisal activity established within an \\norganization as a service to it. It is a control which functions by \\nexamining and evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of other \\ncontrols; a management tool which analyses the effectiveness of all \\nparts of an organization\\u2019s operations and management.\\u2019 \\nThe institute of internal auditors (IIA) also defines Internal Audit on \\nsimilar lines as:  \\n\\u2018Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and \\nconsulting activity designed to add value and improve an \\norganization\\u2019s operations. It helps an organization accomplish its \\nobjectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate \\nand improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and \\ngovernance processes.\\u2019 \\nThese definitions state two clear functions of the Internal Audit \\nactivity namely;  \\n\\uf0d8 Internal control: A process which is performed by the \\nemployees of the company as well as the information technology \\nsystems that are used to assist the company in achieving its \\nobjectives.  \\n\\uf0d8 Management tool: These monitors and evaluates the \\neffectiveness of operational processes and risk management of a \\ncompany [6]. \\nGoals of an audit  \\nThe simple goal of this complex process is to evaluate existing \\nactivities and documentation and determine if they meet the \\nestablished standards. An audit will evaluate the strengths and \\nweaknesses of quality control and quality assurance processes, the \\nresults of which will help us to improve processes and build a better \\nsystem for the benefit of the company. Every product manufactured \\nby a pharmaceutical company has characteristics that must be \\nquantified or qualified by laboratory tests. Quality control and \\nquality assurance are the necessary processes that play the role of \\ncontrol and balance system in pharmaceutical industry. \\nWith proper preparation and planning, the audit itself must easily \\nachieve the intended purpose. Effective auditing and proper \\ncompliance with standards will help build brand reputation and \\navoid the negative effects of non-compliance, such as fines, bad \\npublic relations and court proceedings [7]. \\nObjectives \\nAudit objectives may include:  \\n\\uf0a7 Evaluating conformity of requirements to ISO 9001 \\n\\uf0a7 Evaluating conformity of documentation to ISO 9001 \\nInternational Journal of Applied Pharmaceutics \\nISSN- 0975-7058                               Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019 \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n15 \\n\\uf0a7 Judging conformity of implementation to documentation \\n\\uf0a7 Determining effectiveness in meeting requirements and objectives \\n\\uf0a7 Meeting any contractual or regulatory requirements for auditing \\n\\uf0a7 Providing an opportunity to improve the quality management \\nsystem \\n\\uf0a7 Permitting registration and inclusion in a list of registered \\ncompanies \\n\\uf0a7 Qualifying potential suppliers [3] \\nAudits and regulatory standards \\nThe ISO, a global leader in the development of international \\nstandards, is instrumental in boosting interest in quality audits \\namong manufacturers and other types of businesses when it \\npublished the ISO 9000 standards in 1987. Today, popular standards \\nsuch as ISO 9001: 2000, ISO 14001:2004, and ISO 13485 all require \\ninternal audits of the quality system (or the environmental \\nmanagement system in the case of ISO 14001: 2004). Under these \\nstandards, audit serves as a mechanism for evaluating and \\nimproving quality. The same principle is reflected in a number of \\nregulations enforced by the Food and Drug Administration. Under \\nthe Quality System Regulation (21 Code of federal regulations [CFR] \\nPart 820), medical device manufacturers are required to conduct \\naudits to ensure that the quality system is compliant (Sec. \\n820.22). The current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) \\nregulations for pharmaceuticals (21 CFR Parts 210-211) and for \\nblood and blood components (21 CFR Part 606) include general \\nrequirements for regular evaluation of quality standards. Guidance \\nfor the pharmaceutical industry and blood establishments also \\nemphasize the importance of audits. For example, the \\u201cGuidance for \\nIndustry Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP \\nRegulations\\u201d recommends internal audits and supplier audits. The \\n\\u201cGuidelines for Quality Assurance in Blood Establishments\\u201d call for a \\ncomprehensive audit of the quality assurance program [5]. \\nBenefits of auditing \\nWhilst there is usually low influence on regulatory inspections, \\naudits should be seen as a management tool to assess the company\\u2019s \\nin-house quality management system. Internal, as well as external \\nauditing, can help to achieve this goal. The major benefits of an \\neffective audit system can be summarized as follows:  \\n\\u2022 Managing a quality management system \\n\\u2022 Detecting in advance weak points, through identification of \\nunsatisfactory trends or situations \\n\\u2022 Preventing quality failures, on the basis of quality data reviewing \\n\\u2022 Informing Senior Management about the quality level of facilities \\nand/or operations \\n\\u2022 Standardizing audits will optimize the output, the quality level of \\naudits will increase (and therefore the quality of products and \\nservices) which will finally lead to a continuous improvement loop. \\n\\u2022 The auditee will understand that audits are not created to \\ncontrol and criticize his work, but will improve the company's \\nperformance. This will lead to a higher acceptance of the audits. He \\nwill see audits as a chance to educate and improve his knowledge in \\nterms of quality related aspects. \\n\\u2022 Combining audits of quality, safety, and environmental matters \\nwill reduce the number of audits significantly which will give a \\ngreater acceptance to the auditee and will save his time. \\n\\u2022 Additional benefits can be achieved by pooling audits, for \\nexample, Shared Third Party Audits. \\n\\u2022 By establishing a high-quality audit system throughout the \\nindustry, the level of compliance will increase. Mutual confidence \\nbuilding and an improved relationship between the partners will be \\nthe result of these efforts [9]. \\nTypes of audits \\n1. Internal Audits \\nThe quality audit system mainly classified in three different \\ncategories:  \\n2. External Audits \\n3. Regulatory Audits \\nQuality audits are performed to verify the effectiveness of a quality \\nmanagement system. [5] \\nThis type of audit is also known as First-Party Audit or self-audit. \\nThose auditing and those being audited all belong to the same \\norganization. [1] Internal audit is a professional activity that consists \\nof advising organizations on how to achieve their goals in a better \\nway. The internal audit involves the use of a systematic methodology \\nto analyze business processes or organizational problems and \\nrecommend solutions. The main objectives of internal audits can be \\nsummarized as follows:  \\nInternal audit \\n1. To assist the internal control system. \\n2. Review of organizational policies and their operations. \\n3. Verify the accuracy and authenticity of errors and frauds. \\n4. Detection and prevention of errors and faults. \\n5. Safeguarding the assets \\n6. Applicability of accounting policies. \\n7. Helps in smooth functioning of the internal check system. \\nIn a pharmaceutical facility for internal auditing, one requires to \\ncheck mainly two things namely, \\n\\uf0fc Activities carried out by different departments and \\n\\uf0fc Documents maintained by these departments. \\nFor this purpose, a department-wise questionnaire and document \\nlist is required to be prepared in detail. [8] \\nThis type of audit is also known as Second-Party Audit. It refers to a \\ncustomer conducting an audit on a supplier or contractor. [1] \\nAlthough there are no strict legal requirements for this control. It is \\nalways advisable to evaluate the competence of the contractors in \\nwhich we produce our products or carry out the analysis of our \\nproducts or any other activity according to GMP. Performing these \\naudits also offers important commercial advantages:  \\nExternal audits \\n\\u2022 Develop knowledge and confidence in the partnership agreement \\n\\u2022 Ensures that requirements are understood and met \\n\\u2022 Allow the reduction of some activities (e. g. in-house quality \\ncontrol (QC) testing of starting materials) \\n\\u2022 reduce the risk of failure (and, by implication, its costs) \\nMany pharmaceutical industry suppliers are ISO 9001 or ISO 9002-\\ncertified and are regularly audited by their certification body. \\nPharmaceutical contract manufacturing or packaging companies will \\nneed to be licensed and will be subject to regulatory audits. [8] \\nThis type of audit is also known as Third-Party Audit. Neither \\ncustomer nor supplier conducts this type of audit. A regulatory \\nagency or independent body conducts a third party audit for \\ncompliance or certification or registration purposes. [1] \\nInternational regulatory bodies such as. Medicines and healthcare \\nproducts regulatory agency (MHRA), UK, United States food and \\ndrug administration (USFDA), Therapeutic goods administration \\n(TGA), Australia, Medicines control council (MCC), South Africa, etc. \\nare responsible for carrying out these checks. There is a team to \\nRegulatory audits \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n16 \\nperform the audit; it must be composed of audit inspectors and a \\nmultidisciplinary company team.  \\nThe company must have representatives from each of the following \\ndepartments: production, quality control, warehouse, maintenance, \\nadministration/personnel and marketing/sales. These audits can be \\nperformed without warning (MHRA currently performs around ten \\npercent of its inspections in the UK in this way) as manufacturers \\nare required to always comply with GMPs. Regulatory bodies in \\nother countries where products are sold can also audit companies \\n(e. g. FDA audits European manufacturers). \\nAll regulatory inspectors are extensively trained, competent and \\nprofessional. All MHRA inspectors are professionally qualified and \\nhave a minimum of five years of appropriate experience in a \\nproduction operation; they will be in the registers of persons eligible \\nto act as qualified persons and lead auditors. \\nFailure to approve a regulatory audit may result in restrictions (or \\nrevocation) of production or import/export license. (The FDA has \\nrecently imposed \\\"punitive consensus decrees\\\" on financial \\ncompanies that did not respond adequately to the audit results and \\ncomply with the GMPs). Therefore, it is essential that companies \\nhave defined processes for managing audits and staff should be \\nadequately trained for being audited. Internal audits can provide \\nvaluable opportunities for practice [8]. \\nPrinciples of auditing \\nThe audit is characterized by dependence on a number of principles. \\nThese principles should help to establish audit as an effective and \\nreliable tool to support management policies and controls, by \\nproviding information on what an organization can act to improve \\nits performance. Adherence to these principles is a prerequisite in \\norder to provide relevant and sufficient audit conclusions and allow \\nauditors to work independently from each other, to reach similar \\nconclusions in similar circumstances. \\na) Integrity: the basis of professionalism \\nThe auditors and the person who administers an audit program \\nmust:  \\n-Carry out their work with honesty, diligence, and responsibility;  \\n-Observe and comply with applicable legal requirements;  \\n-Demonstrate their competence while carrying out their work;  \\n-Be sensitive to any influence that can be exercised on the judgment \\nwhile conducting an audit. \\nb) Fair presentation: the obligation to report truthfully and \\naccurately \\nThe audit findings, audit conclusions and audit reports should \\ntruthfully and accurately reflect the activities of the audit. Significant \\nobstacles encountered during the audit and unresolved diverging \\nopinions between the audit team and the auditee should be \\nreported. The communication should be truthful, accurate, objective, \\ntimely, clear and complete. \\nc) Due professional care: the application of diligence and \\njudgment in auditing \\nAuditors should pay due attention to the importance of the task they \\nperform and the trust placed in them by the audit client and other \\ninterested parties. An important factor in the execution of work with \\ndue professional attention is having the ability to express reasoned \\njudgments in all audit situations. \\nd) Confidentiality: security of information \\nAuditors should exercise discretion in the use and protection of \\ninformation acquired in the course of exercising their duties. Audit \\ninformation should not be used inappropriately for personal gain by \\nthe auditor or the audit client, or in a manner detrimental to the \\nlegitimate interests of the auditee. This concept includes the correct \\nmanagement of sensitive or confidential information. \\ne) Independence: the basis for the impartiality of the audit and \\nthe objectivity of the audit conclusions \\nThe auditors should be independent of the activity audited wherever \\npossible, and in all cases, they should act in a manner that is free \\nfrom prejudice and conflicts of interest. For internal audits, auditors \\nmust be independent of the operational managers of the function \\nbeing audited. Auditors must maintain objectivity throughout the \\nreview process to ensure that audit findings and conclusions are \\nbased only on audit evidence. \\nFor small organizations, internal auditors may not be totally \\nindependent of the activity being audited, but all efforts must be \\nmade to eliminate bias and encourage objectivity. \\nf) Evidence-based approach: the rational method for \\nachieving reliable and reproducible audit conclusions in a \\nsystematic audit process \\nAudit evidence must be verifiable. In general, it will be based on \\nsamples of available information, since an audit is conducted in a \\nlimited period of time and with limited resources. An appropriate \\nuse of sampling should be applied, as it is closely related to the \\nconfidence that can be included in the audit conclusions [10]. \\nThe auditor within the audit system  \\nAn auditor is defined by ISO 19011 as a person with the competence \\nto perform an audit. To perform an audit, the auditor must be \\nauthorized for that particular audit. \\nAuditor's responsibility \\nThe auditor has the following responsibilities:  \\n\\uf0a7 Assist in the selection of the team and inform the team \\n\\uf0a7 Responsibility to plan and manage all phases of the audit \\n\\uf0a7 Represent the audit team with the auditee \\n\\uf0a7 Control conflicts and manage difficult situations \\n\\uf0a7 Direct and control all meetings with the team and the auditee \\n\\uf0a7 Make decisions about audit issues and the quality system \\n\\uf0a7 Report the results of the audit without delay \\n\\uf0a7 Report the main obstacles encountered \\n\\uf0a7 Report critical non-conformances immediately \\n\\uf0a7 Possesses effective communication skills \\nManaging an audit program \\nAn audit program may include one or more audits, depending on the \\nsize, nature, and complexity of the organization to be audited. These \\naudits may have a variety of objectives and may also include joint \\n(multiple auditing organizations) or combined (Quality management \\nand Environmental management systems) audits. Management of an \\naudit program includes all the activities necessary for planning and \\norganizing the types and number of audits, and for providing \\nresources for conducting them effectively and efficiently within the \\nspecified time frames [fig. 1]. \\nThe organization\\u2019s top management should grant the authority for \\nmanaging the audit program. Those assigned the responsibility for \\nmanaging the audit program should:  \\n1. Plan, establish, implement, monitor, review and improve the \\naudit program \\n2. Identify the necessary resources and ensure they are provided. \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n17 \\n \\nFig. 1: Managing an audit program\\u2013process flow [3] \\n \\n \\nFig. 2: Various steps of audit activities [3] \\n \\nThe planning and conducting of audit activities involve the following \\nprocess flow or life cycle: as is depicted in Fig. 2. [3]. \\nAudit activities \\nInformation gathering \\nWhat is information? \\nInformation is simply the facts or knowledge provided or learned. It \\ncan be tacit, in people's heads, or explicit, in documents-electronic or \\nhard copy [11]. \\nDuring the audit, information relevant to the objectives, scope and \\ncriteria, including information on interfaces between functions, \\nactivities and processes, should be collected by appropriate \\nsampling and should be verified. Only verifiable information can be \\naudit evidence which must be recorded [3]. \\nAudit evidence is any information used by the auditor to determine \\nif the audited information is in accordance with the established \\ncriteria and to arrive at the conclusions on which the audit opinion is \\nbased. Internal Audit Evidence includes any data, information, \\nprocess flows, vouchers, bills, memos, contracts or transactions.  \\nThe internal audit evidence collected would be dependent on the \\nfollowing:  \\n\\uf0d8 Audit procedures to use-specific procedures should be spelled \\nout for instruction during the audit. \\n\\uf0d8 Sample size-how many items should be tested for each audit \\nprocedure.  \\n\\uf0d8 Items to select-determine which items in the population should \\nbe selected.  \\n\\uf0d8 Timing-timing can vary from the beginning of the accounting \\nperiod to the closure of it [6]. \\nMethods of gathering audit information \\nThere are six basic methods of gathering information during an \\naudit. Depending on the type of information that needs to be \\nobtained, the Internal Auditor will need to determine which method, \\nor combination of methods, should be used. \\nInterviews \\nInterviewing is a powerful data collection technique, which works \\nwell on its own and is often used to support other techniques, such \\nas observation. The interviewee\\u2019s insights can guide the Internal \\nAuditor\\u2019s decisions about what to observe. The most important thing \\nto remember when interviewing is to always talk to the right person, \\nas it can save a lot of time and confusion.  \\nCommunication is a key element to the success of any audit. The more \\neffectively the Internal Auditor interviews personnel, the more useful \\ninformation will be gathered. Questions may be asked several times in \\ndifferent ways or to different people depending on their level of \\nresponsibility (Operator, Supervisor, etc.) in order to get a complete \\nanswer. \\nInspections \\nWhen inspecting something, it is good practice to start with general \\nobservations and then proceeding to the more specific elements. First, \\nthe Internal Auditor will have a good overall look around the facility and \\nthen examine specific items more closely, noting anything that does not \\nseem quite right. It is important to ask questions throughout the \\ninspection. If a problem is found, the Internal Auditor must investigate \\n(dig deeper) to explore the extent of the finding.  \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n18 \\nReviewing documents \\nWhen reviewing company records, the Internal Auditor can use a \\nnumber of techniques. Random sampling is one of them. It gives a \\ngeneral idea of the quality of record keeping and exposes the \\npotential problem areas. However, one sample taken in one given \\nperiod of time is usually not enough to form accurate conclusions. \\nAnother important aspect of record keeping is clarity. Documents \\nshould be clear regardless of who reads them. Details vary but, in \\ngeneral, every document should carry a title, an owner and a \\nrevision status. If any of this information is missing, the Internal \\nAuditor should ask why. The revisions noted should be checked \\nagainst the master record. Changes must be authorized, signed and \\ndated by an authorized person. \\nObservations \\nThe simplest way to check how a process works is to observe it in \\naction. Observing a routine activity for a couple of hours can give the \\nInternal Auditor the opportunity to see how something is done \\nunder normal circumstances. He or she should ask questions about \\nwhat they see, making sure at all times not to interfere with the \\nprocesses they are observing, as that may cause the personnel not to \\ncarry out their tasks as they usually do. \\nVertical tracking  \\nThis method is also referred to as \\u201cvertical auditing\\u201d and consists of \\nfollowing a specific development from the beginning until the end, \\nsimultaneously checking all the records that are produced in the \\nprocess. Applying the vertical tracking technique can lead the \\nInternal Auditor to areas that were not initially part of the scope, but \\nit does facilitate a bigger picture view, as this allows the Internal \\nAuditor to see how the various parts of a given program work \\ntogether. \\nExercises \\nThe aim of an exercise is to test something that is usually done at the \\nfacility as part of the routine. However, the Internal Auditor gets to \\npick the time and the circumstances for the test. The subject of \\ntesting can be the personnel, the program, or the equipment. An \\nInternal Auditor should not run an exercise without the knowledge \\nand cooperation of the auditee. Doing so is likely to have negative \\nconsequences as unannounced actions may breach certain facility-\\nspecific rules or regulations which the Internal Auditor is unaware of.  \\nTaking notes \\nA good Internal Auditor must have his or her own efficient way of \\ntaking notes. This is an extremely important part of the job that \\ncannot be neglected. Notes must get reviewed and refined along the \\nway. In situations where taking notes is inconvenient, a mental note-\\ntaking technique should be used. Notes are used to organize \\nthoughts and observations which will, in turn, help the Internal \\nAuditor reach accurate conclusions throughout the audit. Notes need \\nto be reviewed and completed at the end of each audit day [12]. \\n \\n \\nFig. 3: Process for collecting information to reach audit conclusions [3] \\n \\nAdministration \\nThe internal audit team must have the confidence and trust of the \\nkey stakeholders it works with and be seen as a credible source of \\nassurance and advice. This confidence should not be assumed and \\ncan only be established and maintained by having an effective \\nworking relationship, by delivering high-quality and timely advice \\nand internal audit reports that are seen to be contributing directly to \\nassisting the organisation to meet its responsibilities. The key \\nstakeholders of internal audit are:  \\n\\u2022Chief Executive \\n\\u2022Board of Directors \\n\\u2022Audit Committee \\n\\u2022Senior management \\n\\u2022External auditor \\n\\u2022Other reviewers \\nThe importance of these individual relationships is analysed below. \\na) Chief executive \\nWhile internal audit reports functionally to the Audit Committee, it \\nis important that the Head of Internal Audit has direct access, as and \\nwhen required, to the Chief Executive. \\nOrganisations today, recognize the advantages in making the Head of \\nInternal Audit directly accountable to the Chief Executive. This not \\nonly sends a clear signal about the importance of the internal audit \\nfunction, it also facilitates regular contact between the Chief \\nExecutive and internal audit. This contact should be used as an \\nopportunity to gain insights into new and emerging risks and issues \\nfacing the organisation and to discuss the role the Chief Executive \\nexpects internal audit to fulfill in the company. \\nb) Board of directors \\nThe Head of Internal Audit may formally report to the Board of \\nDirectors on the effectiveness of the internal audit function in order \\nto exchange views and ideas. As the Audit Committee is usually a \\nsub-committee of the Board, this responsibility is often delegated to \\nthe Audit Committee. As a minimum, it is important that the Head of \\nInternal Audit has direct access to the Chair of the Board and the \\nChief Executive, as and when required. \\nc) Audit committee \\nAudit Committees play an integral role in the governance framework \\nof organizations. It assists Chief Executives and Boards to \\nunderstand whether key controls are appropriate and operating \\neffectively. In this respect, the relationship between internal audit \\nand the Audit Committee is crucial and has a number of dimensions \\nwhich are mentioned below:  \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n19 \\na) Advise the Chief Executive about the internal audit plans of the \\norganisation;  \\nb) Direct or coordinate work programs relating to internal and \\nexternal audits;  \\nc) Review the content of internal [and external] audits to identify \\nsignificant matters of concern, and to advise the Chief Executive on \\ngood practice or opportunities for improvement;  \\nd) Review the adequacy of responses to reports of internal and \\nexternal audits;  \\ne) Endorse the internal audit charter and be responsible for either \\nreviewing and approving internal audit plans or recommending \\ntheir approval by the Chief Executive/Board of Directors;  \\nf) Act as the internal audit function\\u2019s primary client and form a \\nsound professional relationship with the internal audit team as a \\nwhole and each of its members;  \\ng) Utilize internal audit reports and its general interaction with the \\nInternal Audit team, to assess the effectiveness of controls and the \\nperformance of the organisation and \\nh) Utilize the internal audit function to undertake secretariat \\ncompliance \\nGiven this relationship, it is important that both formal and informal \\nlines of communication be maintained between internal audit and \\nthe Audit Committee and with individual committee members, \\nparticularly the Chair. Audit Committee members should be in a \\nposition to be able to openly discuss matters of interest with the \\nHead of Internal Audit. It is also good practice for the Audit \\nCommittee to meet privately with the Head of Internal Audit from \\ntime to time to ask questions and to seek feedback from internal \\naudit without management being present. This practice also \\nsupports the independent role of internal audit. \\nd) Senior management \\nTo effectively fulfill its responsibilities, it is important that internal \\naudit has a professional and constructive relationship with senior \\nmanagement of the organization. Internal auditors should interact on a \\nregular basis with members of the senior management team, and \\nthrough the delivery of practical, business-focused and useful reports \\nand advice, build a relationship that is based on cooperation, \\ncollaboration and mutual respect. Meetings with organization \\nmanagers should be used as an opportunity to be briefed on key \\nbusiness developments and associated risks facing the organization. \\nThese meetings should also be used to obtain informal feedback about \\nthe performance of internal audit and to assist in identifying ways that \\ninternal audit can best assist organization management. Thus, the \\ninternal audit team would encourage managers to seek their advice \\nand assistance on either an informal or formal basis as the need arises. \\ne) External auditors \\nExternal auditors too must help in developing internal audit strategy \\nand internal audit work plan. Both audit teams need to address the \\nkey financial and business systems underpinning the company's \\nfinancial statements and to avoid duplication of compliance and \\nassurance. To avoid such duplication, the external auditor must \\nevaluate the work of the internal audit function to determine its \\nadequacy for external audit purposes. The Internal audit function \\ncan be made responsible for liaising with external auditor on behalf \\nof the organization. Such a role can be a useful way for an internal \\naudit team to be aware of planned and actual external audit \\ncoverage. Thus, a constructive relationship between both sets of \\nauditors assists in the conduct of external audits. Such a role can \\nonly be fulfilled when there is healthy communication between \\ninternal and external audit teams which can be achieved by setting \\nup formally establish meetings between internal and external audit \\nto allow for a routine exchange of information. \\nf) Other reviewers \\nInternal audit is one of a number of internal and external review and \\nassurance activities that exist as part of an organization\\u2019s \\ngovernance arrangements. The company shall benefit when all these \\nactivities, such as those performed by the Ombudsman and \\nregulators, operate in a coordinated and complementary manner to \\nthe greatest extent possible. This requires regular formal and \\ninformal contact between review bodies to minimize duplication \\nand overlap. Some organisations see a benefit in protocols being \\nformalised for such activities: providing, for example, for the regular \\nexchange of views and information and for the reporting of the \\nresults of work undertaken in a coordinated manner. Protocols can \\nbe particularly important in situations where internal audit needs to \\nwork closely with other entities as a result of inter-agency or other \\nagreements. [6] \\nAudit planning procedures  \\nIn order to conduct an audit effectively and efficiently, the work \\nneeds to be planned and controlled. The form and nature of the \\nplanning required for an audit will be affected by the size and \\ncomplexity of the enterprise, the commercial environment in which \\nit operates, the methods of processing transactions and the \\nreporting requirements to which it is subjected.  \\nAudit planning is the formulation of the general strategy for audit \\nwhich sets the direction for the audit, describes the expected scope \\nand conduct of the audit and provides guidance for the development \\nof the audit program.  \\nAdequate planning of an audit work aims at  \\na. Establishing the intended means of achieving the objectives of \\nthe audit  \\nb. Assisting in the direction and control of the work  \\nc. Helping to ensure that attention is devoted to critical aspects of \\nthe audit work  \\nd. Ensuring that the work is completed expeditiously  \\ne. Facilitating review of the audit work  \\nf. Helping to assign the proper tasks to members of the audit team \\nand coordinates outside experts. \\nThe audit plan  \\nThe auditor should develop an audit plan for the audit in order to reduce \\naudit risk to an acceptably low level. The audit plan is more detailed than \\nthe overall audit strategy and includes the nature, timing, and extent of \\naudit procedures to be performed by engagement team members in \\norder to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to reduce audit risk \\nto an acceptably low level. Documentation of the audit plan also serves \\nas a record of the proper planning and performance of the audit \\nprocedures that can be reviewed and approved prior to the performance \\nof further audit procedures. [13] \\nPlanning objectives \\n\\\"The objective of the auditor is to plan the audit so that it will be \\nperformed in an effective manner.\\\" Audits are potentially complex, \\nrisky and expensive processes. Although firms have internal \\nmanuals and standardized procedures, it is vital that engagements \\nare planned to ensure that the auditor:  \\n\\u2022 Devotes appropriate attention to important areas of the audit;  \\n\\u2022 Identifies and resolves potential problems on a timely basis;  \\n\\u2022 Organizes and manages the audit so that it is performed in an \\neffective and efficient manner;  \\n\\u2022 Selects team members with appropriate capabilities and \\ncompetencies;  \\n\\u2022 Directs and supervises the team and reviews their work; and \\n\\u2022 Effectively coordinates the work of others, such as experts and \\ninternal audit. \\nThe purpose of all this is to ensure that the risk of performing a poor \\nquality audit (and ultimately giving an inappropriate audit opinion) \\nis reduced to an acceptable level [14]. \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n20 \\nThe steps in planning an audit include (Planning Procedures\\n1. \\n): \\nBasic discussions with the client \\n2. \\nabout the nature of the \\nengagement are performed first, and the auditor meets the key \\nemployees or new employees of a continuing client. The overall \\naudit strategy or the timing of the audit may also be discussed. \\nReview of audit documentation \\n3. \\nfrom previous audits \\nperformed by the accounting firm or a predecessor auditor (if the \\nlatter makes these audit documentation available) will assist in \\ndeveloping an outline of the audit program. \\nAsk about recent developments \\n4. \\nin the company such as \\nmergers and new product lines which will cause the audit to differ \\nfrom earlier years. \\nInterim financial statements are analyzed to identify accounts \\nand transactions that differ from expectations (based on factors such \\nas budgets or prior periods). The performance of such analytical \\nprocedures is mandatory \\n5. \\nin the planning of an audit to identify \\naccounts that may be misstated and that deserve special emphasis in \\nthe audit program. \\nNon-audit personnel \\n6. \\nof the accounting firm who have provided \\nservices (such as tax preparation) to the client should be identified \\nand consulted to learn more about the client. \\nStaffing \\n7. \\nfor the audit should be determined and a meeting held \\nto discuss the engagement. \\nTiming \\n8. \\nof the various audit procedures should be determined \\nOutside assistance needs should be determined, including the \\nuse of a specialist \\n9. \\nas required and the determination of the extent of \\ninvolvement of the internal auditors of the client. \\nPronouncements \\n10. \\non accounting principles and audit guides \\nshould be read or reviewed to assist in the development of complete \\naudit programs fitting the unique needs of the industry. \\nScheduling with the client \\nThe internal audit work plan would generally include:  \\nis needed to coordinate \\nactivities.[15] \\n1. Audit title \\n2. Functional and Operational Area to be covered \\n3. Director and manager responsible \\n4. Type and scope of internal audit \\n5. The benefit expected by the audit procedure \\n6. Resources allocation for the purpose of the audit \\n7. Proposed duration and timelines for completion [6] \\nAuditing procedure \\nThere are total 10 steps of the audit process:  \\n1. Notification: Audit process begins with notification. The \\nnotification process alerts the party to be audited of the date and \\ntime of the process. The notification also will list the documents that \\nthe order wishes to review in order to understand the organization \\nof the company. \\n2. Planning: Planning is the steps the auditor takes, before the audit, \\nto identify key areas of risk and areas of concern. \\n3. Opening meeting: Meeting between the auditing staff and senior \\nmanagement of the auditing target as well as administrative staff. \\nThe auditors will describe the process they will undertake. \\nManagement will describe areas of concern to them and the \\nschedule of the employees that must be consulted.  \\n4. Fieldwork: Fieldwork begins after the results of the meeting are \\nused to adjust the final audit plans. Employees are notified of the \\naudit, schedules are drawn up regarding the activities of the audit \\nstaff, and an initial investigation begun after learning of business \\nprocedures, interviewing key staff, testing current business \\npractices by sampling, reviewing the law and testing internal rules \\nand practices for reasonableness. \\n5. Communication: The audit team should consistently be in \\ncontact with the corporate auditor to clarify processes, gain access \\nto documents and clarify procedures. \\n6. Draft audit: At the completion of the audit, the next step, the draft \\naudit, is prepared. The draft audit detail what was done and what \\nwas found, a distribution list of parties to receive preliminary \\nresults, and a list of concerns. \\n7. Management response: The draft is given to management to \\nreview, edit and suggest changes, probe areas of concern and correct \\nerrors. Upon making final corrections, the report is given to \\nmanagement for the seventh step, the management response. \\nManagement is requested to answer the report by stating whether \\nthey agree with the problems cited, the plan to correct noted problem \\nand the expected date by which all issues will have been addressed. \\n8. Final meeting: The final meeting is designed to close loose ends, \\ndiscuss the management response and address the scope of the \\naudit. \\n9. Report distribution: The ninth step is the report distribution, \\nwhere the final audit report is sent to appropriate officials inside \\nand outside the audit area.  \\n10. Feedback: The last step is the audit feedback whereby the \\naudited company implements the recommended changes and the \\nauditor's review and test the quality, adherence and effects of the \\nadopted changes. This continues until all issues are adopted and the \\nnext audit cycle begins. [1] \\nAs the audit proceeds, there might arise some situations where the \\nfacts indicate there is a failure, either partially or wholly, of the \\nquality management system, such a situation is \\ncalled \\nRecording nonconformities or deficiencies \\nnonconformity\\u201d. \\n\\uf0a7 a condition adverse to Quality \\nWhat is nonconformity? \\n\\uf0a7 The non-fulfillment of a requirement \\n1. The procedure or defined process does not conform to the \\nregulatory requirements \\nThere may be nonconformity for one of three reasons \\n2. The procedure or process has not been put into practice in the \\ndescribed way \\n3. The practice, what is actually done, is not effective (planned \\nresults not achieved). \\nThe statement of nonconformity needs to be in a format \\nunderstandable both to people in the audit and to those who were \\nnot. People who were not present at the audit will be assigned to \\ntake the necessary corrective action most often. This need alone \\ndefines some rules for the recording of nonconformities:  \\n1. Exact observation of the facts. Only the facts are needed, and \\nthe reporting of them needs to be exact. \\n2. Where was it found? The statement needs to identify exactly \\nwhere it was found; otherwise, it may not be found again. \\n3. What was found? It needs to be clear so that people understand \\nwhat aspect of the system is nonconforming. \\n4. Why is it nonconformity? The statement needs to make it clear \\nwhat specified requirement has not been met. \\n5. What is the objective evidence of the nonconformity? What \\naudit evidence do we have\\u2013records, documents, statements or \\nobservations for our nonconformity findings? \\n6. Who was involved? The statement often has no need to involve \\nspecific people, but where the objective evidence was based on a \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n21 \\nstatement, and then the statement and the originator (s) need to be \\nclear. Job titles rather than names should be used. \\n7. Use local terminology. Industry has its own names for certain \\nactivities, documents, etc. These unique terms should be used for clarity. \\n8. Make it retrievable. Someone has to go back after the audit and \\nput it right, possibly after a considerable period of time. \\n9. Make it helpful. To be helpful, nonconformity statements \\nshould be complete, correct, concise and clear. Suggestions, \\nparticularly on external audits, are not recommended, nor are they \\nthe auditor\\u2019s duty [3]. \\nClassification of deficiencies \\nThe number of nonconformities that can arise during an audit can be \\nnumerous. Following types of defects are identified during an \\ninternal audit and these are helpful in regulatory compliance:  \\nCritical defect \\nCritical defects have a high probability of resulting in a product \\nrecall or in an adverse physiological response by the consumer. \\nCritical deficiencies found in internal audits that usually produce \\nsignificant effects on the strength, identity, safety, and purity of the \\nproduct that will be considered during regulatory compliance. \\nThe possible source of a critical defect \\n\\u2022 Cross-contamination of materials of the product \\n\\u2022 Incorrect labeling \\n\\u2022 Active ingredients outside of specifications \\n\\u2022 Product manufactured according to obsolete or unapproved \\nprocedures \\n\\u2022 Open sterile products located in a non-aseptic area \\n\\u2022 Untrained operators working in the sterile filling area \\n\\u2022 Contaminated purified water or water for injection system \\nMajor defect \\nMajor defects found during the internal audit can reduce the \\nusability or stability of a product, but without causing harm to the \\nconsumer. \\nThe possible source of a major defect \\n\\u2022 Major equipment not calibrated or out of calibration \\n\\u2022 Inadequate segregation of quarantine components \\n\\u2022 Inadequate evaluation of production process outside of action \\nlevels \\n\\u2022 Process deviations not properly documented or investigated \\n\\u2022 Operator not trained in or familiar with the standard operating \\nprocedures \\n\\u2022 Preventive maintenance on a critical water system not conducted \\naccording to schedule \\n\\u2022 Lack of standard operating procedures for cleaning equipment. \\n\\u2022 Audits of a contract manufacturer not conducted \\nMinor defect \\nMinor defects have a low probability of affecting the quality or \\nusability of the product which can help in regulatory compliance. \\nPossible source of the minor defect \\n\\u2022 Failure to complete all batch record entries \\n\\u2022 Warehouse not cleaned according to schedule \\n\\u2022 Cracks in wall surfaces \\n\\u2022 Failures to correct documentation errors properly \\n\\u2022 Operator uniform not properly worn \\n\\u2022 Standard operating procedure review is overdue \\n\\u2022 Adhesive tape used on manufacturing equipment \\n\\u2022 Laboratory buffer solutions are obsolete [16] \\nCONCLUSION \\nA quality systems approach calls for audits to be conducted at \\nplanned intervals to evaluate effective implementation and \\nmaintenance of the quality system and to determine if processes and \\nproducts meet established parameters and specifications. An audit \\nperformed by a well-trained and thoroughly prepared auditor can be \\nhighly beneficial by identifying areas for genuine improvement. An \\naudit should not to be seen as interrogation with the auditee as \\npermanent loser, it is a comparison of what is laid down to what is in \\nplace. Auditing is no goal in itself. Auditing in the pharmaceutical \\nsector serves two different categories: regulatory compliance and \\nbusiness needs. When employees and managers begin to see audits \\nas opportunities to improve, they begin to see auditors not as police \\nofficers but as productive members of the organization. \\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \\nNil \\nAUTHORS CONTRIBUTIONS \\nAll the authors have contributed equally \\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS \\nNone \\nREFERENCES \\n1.

Problem Statement\\nThe last three years have been problematic for Argentine agribusinesses given that\\nthe economical crisis of December 2002 has strongly affected them; however, it\\nforced farmers and processors to look for new alternatives. Instead of domestic\\nmarket, export appears as an advantageous opportunity because of disparity in the\\ndollar / peso rate, among others. On the other hand, to be competitive at the\\n                                                                \\ni  Correspondence to: Tel: + 54-11-4524-0957\\n                Email: calidad@mail.agro.uba.arI. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\ninternational level requires building competitive advantages linking quality and\\norigin and/or food safety and quality assurance management as key drivers of\\nagribusiness.\\nIn the food chain, the development of food safety is mandatory while quality\\nassurance is voluntary. It is not the same to implement food safety such as: GMP ,\\nSSOP , HACCP  and/or others, that assures the consumption of food is safe, than to\\nimplement quality assurance such as: ISO  9000 Standards, total quality\\nmanagement or continues improvement, which are quality assurance systems\\nsatisfying customers\\u2019 implicit and explicit expectations . By all means, to the food\\nindustry, food safety is a pathway to quality management, and both are essential\\ntechnological innovations for competitiveness.\\nIn the domestic market, the perception of the needs of food safety and quality\\nassurance -as strategy of competitiveness by the Small and Medium Sized Food\\nIndustry- is recent. This requirement has been promoted by the globalization\\nprocess, new markets penetration, exports increasing, consumers\\u2019 satisfaction, and\\nby world-wide dissemination, as competitive advantages and, in some cases, as\\npara-technical barriers.\\nThe current situation in Argentina related to food safety shows that just 35 beef\\nslaughterhouses, 12 poultry, eggs and hunting products industries, and 300 fishing\\n-factory vessels, have been GMP and HACCP audited and approved by the\\nArgentine National Inspection Services, the European Union, and the United\\nStates. Those statistics point out an increase since more than three years ago\\nHACCP approvals in the Argentine food industry were not more than 20. The\\nscenario of quality assurance is less optimistic because only 15% of the 450 ISO\\ncertified industries belong to a food industry sector.\\nThat proves in despite of sharing the same institutional and organizational frame,\\nnew technological designs emerge from that uncertain economic scenario, allowing a\\nrealistic study of the effectiveness and efficiency of Argentine agribusinesses and its\\nnew and potential alternatives.\\nAt the time of deciding any new technological system, the restrictions and obstacles\\nare common to most medium and small sized food industries around the world,\\nincluding human, economical and technological resources deficiency:\\n\\uffff  \\\"\\u2026inadequate basic hygiene,\\n\\uffff  inadequate infrastructure and facilities\\n\\uffff  financial limits,\\n\\uffff  lack of knowledge of the business\\n\\uffff  lack of skill and information,I.

The cases\\nunder study are introducing technological designs as food safety and quality\\nassurance systems\\u2013with third party or self certification- generating new business\\nunderneath of both a chaotic domestic market and a competitive international one.\\nThe three experiences selected for this comparative analysis are confronting the\\naforementioned obstacles at different organizational levels and in different\\ntechnological models. They are developing:\\n\\uffff  GMP and HACCP in the lamb slaughterhouse,\\n\\uffff  Green Beef Quality Protocol \\u2013 Good Cattle Practices and Traceability-, in the\\nCattle Farms, Quality Management -ISO 9001/2000 Standard- in Private\\nPort (Grain & Cereal Reception \\u2013Quality Homogenization \\u2013 Identity\\nPreservation - Ship Load) Service.\\nThe common purpose of those agribusinesses' leaders is to develop strategic and\\ncompetitive advantages based on food safety and quality assurance. The\\nmanagement recognized the need of leading a cultural change inside the\\norganization \\u2013in the human resources area- and found out that the technological\\napproach, as a common goal, would drive it. They chose those new designs as a\\npathway to accomplish the workforce commitment with a precise objective.\\n2. Objective\\nThe main objective of the paper is to make a comparative analysis of three cases\\nunder study. Agribusinesses developing new technological models are focused on the\\nevaluation of food safety and quality assurance systems related to strategic and\\ncompetitive advantages. The result of that analysis allows also evaluating impacts\\non the food chain under the light of the agribusinesses\\u2019 new vision and values.\\nExternal limitations and internal restraints are expected as a result of the complex\\neconomical scenario and precarious strategic alliances under which those\\nagribusinesses are inserted.\\n3. Procedures\\n                                                                \\n1 Motarjemi, Y and K\\u00e4ferstein, F.

Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nThe procedure is based on the description of three cases in order to evaluate: a)\\ndifferent levels and stages of food safety and quality assurance approaches as key\\ndrivers to strategic and competitive advantages and b) management and human\\nresources\\u2019 new perspective and cultural change and how it introduces change in\\nfarm and industry.\\n\\uffff  The first case of study is the lamb agribusiness in Patagonia. A group of\\nsheep farmers of Southern Patagonia constituted Estancias de Patagonia \\u2013\\ntrademark, a new type of company producing, processing and exporting\\ncarcasses and cuts to Europe.  The farmers also self-constituted the\\nshareholders of Patagonia Sur slaughterhouse, which is processing sheep\\nfrom Patagonia. They settled a strategic alliance with the provincial\\ngovernment \\u2013owner of the slaughterhouse and the plant manager \\u2013\\nresponsible for the concession. This slaughterhouse is implementing GMP\\nand HACCP in order to meet the terms of the European Union requirements\\nto keep the current market and to increase the exports volume of Estancias\\nde Patagonia\\u2019s farmers.\\n\\uffff  The second case is on beef agribusiness, located in the \\u201cpampas,\\u201d an\\nimportant cattle area in Buenos Aires hinterland called \\u201cCuenca del Salado\\u201d.\\nThis case is about creating network of certified cattle suppliers-- a consortium\\nof origin and quality assurance--that meets organic and natural meat\\nattributes. The group of farmers is developing good cattle practices (GCP),\\nincluding features such as: genetic, animal reproduction, natural grass feed,\\nhandling, and animal health and welfare, all under the Product and Process\\u2019s\\nQuality Protocol. They also are developing traceability starting with\\nindividual identification and a database network. The system might need a\\nthird party certification.\\n\\uffff  The last case is grain and cereal stocking and ship loading, private port\\nservice at Terminal Quequen, located in Buenos Aires Province. The process\\nof the service includes reception, storage, and quality homogenization,\\nidentity preservation (IP) and ship load. Historically, it was a government-\\nrun organization and after privatization, it became a private company. The\\ninvolved actors are shareholders owning the plant and a manager with\\nprivate sector management\\u2019s skill, managing the plant. Because of the\\nincomes and the complex interaction between workers with different\\nbackground, the manager\\u2019s decision is to implement the strategic plan and\\nISO 9001/2000 with the main purpose of transforming the \\u201chuman resources\\u201d\\nin \\u201csocial Capital\\u201d like competitive assets, by means of ISO\\u2019s certification.\\n3.1. Food Safety - Self-control ProgramI. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\n\\u201cEstancias de Patagonia SA\\\" is a group of farmers from Santa Cruz, Patagonia\\u00b4s\\ntrademark, and through a strategic alliance they become the shareholders of the\\nSlaughterhouse \\u201cPatagonia Sur\\u201d where their sheep and lambs are processed.\\nProvincial Government owns the plant, and it had been given in concession to a\\ncontractor who also is the manager. The farmers-government-manager partnership\\nis important in the light of decision making. Meaning that all the partners decided\\nto implement GMP and HACCP in the slaughterhouse to meet the European Union\\nrequirements in order to keep the current market and increase the volume of its\\nexports to the European Union, the United States and Japan.\\nThe partners bet on food safety system with the main purpose of adding value to\\ntheir products, as first step, and planning ISO 9001(vs 2000) certification, as a next\\nstep. Although aware that they are a sort of collective strategy (farmers, industry\\nmanagement and government) with a win-win relationship and common interest,\\nnot all of them have deeply understood the main purpose. Thus, they decided\\nstarting with a technological model that would provoke the cultural crash and the\\nensuing change.\\nThe Design and Implementation of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point\\nSystem (HACCP) Proposal is a part of previous project called \\u201cLamb from\\nPatagonia, Santa Cruz, Denomination of Origin.\\u201d It was financially supported by\\nthe Provincial Government and technically assisted by the university in 2000/2001.\\nThe university with the co-ordination of the National Inspection Service\\n(government financing University assistance) assists this new proposal, based on\\nHACCP Design 2002. The contractor financially supports all the investment and\\nexpenditures related to implementation of the self-control program.\\n\\u201cPatagonia Sur\\u201d annual outcome is around 150,000 sheep and lambs. However, the\\nfactory slaughters hares from May to August, the most profitable activity, lamb\\nprocessing, starts in December and ends by April. The plant has almost 200\\nemployees, 40 of which are permanent and the rest are temporary. This is a key\\nissue since HACCP needs trained personnel and on account of workers\\u2019 transitory\\ncondition, training must be made earlier every year.\\nThe Good Manufacture Practices and Sanitation Standard Operative Procedures\\nare the food hygiene and correct manipulation prerequisites required in both\\ndomestic and international markets. Those prerequisites have been essential to\\nprocess safe food for human consumption. They also are useful tools to the design of\\nslaughterhouses and the operative processes of safe food.\\nThe HACCP System is founded on those prerequisites and consequently has become\\nworldwide food safety\\u2019s synonymous, being to both industry and governments\\nrequired standards. The HACCP provides systematic and proactive evaluation ofI. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nfood safety because it defines potential hazards: biological, chemical and physical,\\nwhich can jeopardize consumer\\u2019s health.\\nA successful HACCP Plan means a settled and proved system by SENASA, a\\nnational or international third party certification and approval by the inspection\\nservices of the United States and/or the European Union. Currently, SENASA is\\nalso requiring not only HACCP (by June of 2003), but also the ISO 9001 rule\\u2019s\\ncertification by 2005. It is offering a stable institutional framework to those who\\nhave invested in food safety and would have to invest in quality assurance.\\n3.1.1 Introducing HACCP System: Phase of Application\\nThe process of implementation began with a first inspection and evaluation audit,\\ndriven by SENASA, to define the current situation and the following methodology.\\nMany hygienic and sanitary hazards were found in the process, caused by\\ninadequate and old infrastructure dating back more than 30 years, low employees\\u2019\\ncompetence and serious cross contamination difficulties due to operative process\\nflow.\\nThe implementation selected method was the progressive one taking into account\\nslaughterhouse\\u2019s features, manager and employees\\u2019 availability, and SENASA and\\ndifferent countries\\u2019 mandatory specifications and requirements. This method has\\nallowed initiating activities simultaneously knowing HACCP plan requires many\\ninvestments that must be decided by the manager.\\nIn order to develop process performance, the process\\u2019s critical limits are listed and\\ndefined, such as: temperature, time, and pH, among others, respecting its\\nparameter range, allowing the process to be under control. Because there is no\\nmicrobiological standard reference in the world, it is required to register the meat\\npacker data at least for more of 3 years and to analyze the trend in order to define\\nthe factory standard.\\nOnce the Critical Control Points (CCP) are agreed, they must be constantly\\nmeasured through analysis and/or visual observations, which are verified  in\\nnormal conditions, assuring the process can be maintained and that it is realistic.\\nThe statistical methodology is used to verify that the process stays under control in\\nthose conditions. During the verification, it is also demonstrated whether the\\nprocess is able to reach the defined control criteria (critical limit).\\nAs a result, the manager encouraged his supervisors to search for hygiene and cross\\ncontamination due to failure of infrastructure and incorrect manipulation focusing\\non the plant flow, the operative process and the product. Major investment was\\nmade and changes introduced since this process started but there are still manyI. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\ninfrastructure repairs, hardware and software innovations, and technical changes\\npending.\\n3.1.2  Phase of Human Resources Structural Changes\\nOne of the most common causes of process failures is the lack of commitment, which\\ncan be only driven by the leader. For that reason it is necessary to focus on training\\nand dissemination as the adequate tools to provoke motivation and increase\\ncompetence as well. By all means, training was highlighted from the beginning,\\neven though it has continued through the whole process. The shareholders have\\nattended dissemination meetings because at the moment of decision making their\\nawareness of the HACCP needs is very important.\\nAs HACCP principles require, HACCP team members were decided. The tem\\nconsists of interdisciplinary experts from Buenos Aires University, Estancias de\\nPatagonia SA, manager plant, veterinary plant, a SENASA inspector (placed in the\\nindustry), and it is supported by SENASA (experts). The veterinary plant will\\nmanage the quality program, and will be responsible for keeping the HACCP\\nupdated and permanently reviewed.\\nThe team meets periodically and area supervisors are permanently called up to\\nwork on the HACCP plan with the purpose of making them aware of their essential\\nrole of managing personnel. The supervisors\\u2019 main responsibility is to make workers\\naware of manipulating high-risk food. Employees unaware of the importance of\\ncleanness, hygiene, and right manipulation cannot be blamed for jeopardizing food\\nsafety and consequently, consumers\\u2019 health. However, the person responsible for\\nleading the change is the manager who must show commitment through daily\\ndecision and behavior.\\nSo far, the motivation and awareness of all involved workers has been apparently\\npositive since the manager started making the recommended investments and\\nworking on the process hygienic basic problems. Meanwhile, the HACCP team had\\nmeetings with all technical areas in order to keep them motivated and committed.\\n3.1.3 Impact of the self- control system\\nDuring the process, the external context changed and the original requirements\\nincreased as a result of the European Union visit to Argentine meat industry.\\nFulfilling specifications requires deeper changes and more investment. In the last\\nmonths the activities were carried out according to the planned agenda; however,\\ndelays have already appeared as a result of delayed investment and workers\\nmanipulation changes.I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\n\\u201cPatagonia Sur\\u201d had all the expected obstacles related to insufficient basic hygiene,\\nlow personnel competence, financial scarcity, old infrastructure and facilities, and\\npoor communication. About the strategic alliance, the partners have been acting\\nwithout assuming their duties, which was neither helping nor supporting HACCP\\nimplementation. Still worse, the contractor did not comply with the minimal signed\\ncontract with both the government and the shareholders. The shareholders never\\nvisited the slaughterhouse until some problems showed up. At the beginning, the\\nveterinary Plant was working without empowerment and SENASA inspector was\\nneither controlling nor demanding minimal regulation requirements.\\nThose technical and financial limitations and partners\\u2019 behavior impacted in the\\nemployees\\u2019 commitment and motivation. Consequently, the HACCP success has\\nbeen jeopardized, and reviewing minimal requirements has been the main cause of\\nthe delayed agenda.\\nUnder those circumstances, there were also positive impacts. The first was to make\\nevident all the emerging problems both technologic and operative -based on\\ninfrastructure complications- making the partners aware of those limitations and\\ndriving them to make the necessary decisions on investing.\\nThe second HACCP positive impact was also to bring out the complexity of the\\nstrategic alliance. It forced the partners to review their own duty, demanding\\nshareholders, management and the local SENASA inspector to meet the terms of\\nthe original agreement. As long as those internal constraints are not faced and\\nsolved, the new model will fail, not being a genuine competitive advantage at all.\\n3.2. Green Beef Quality Protocol \\u2013 Self Certification Model\\nThe proposal \\u201cPampas del Salado\\u201d introduces a paradigmatic change aimed at the\\nconstruction of a new strategy in the business of cattle and beef in Argentina. This\\nis a unique \\u201cPilot Project\\u201d which defines a new model planned to go from calf region\\n\\u201cPampas del Salado\\u201d to the entire livestock of the \\\"Pampas Argentina.\\\" This is a\\nleading case involves more than 300 farmers from 11 municipalities, almost 200\\nthousand hectares and more than 65,000 animals, compared to the larger number of\\nArgentine livestock, nearing 50 million head.\\nThe institutional framework must protect property rights in order to allow the use\\nof the geographical area name as denomination of origin. Also, the law must provide\\na stable and secure platform in order to make the competitive advantages\\nsustainable in the long run. Organizational innovation consolidates the coordination\\nof collective action and strategic alliance based on the significant asset involved.\\nThe technological aspect is related to the three quality protocols formulated,\\nenabling different attributes of quality, origin and required traceability in order to\\nadd value to one of the most remarkable Argentine products.I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nThe main objective starts joining the collective action of cattle dealers around the\\norigin and quality protocols: green beef , grain beef  and eco-beef . This strategy\\naims at increasing negotiation ability in the cattle sector in order to influence the\\nbeef business. The idea is to collect local data creating local knowledge with global\\nimpact, and a farmers\\u2019 network managing information and knowledge through\\nCOPRODER, a regional group of municipalities, in order to become a self-certified\\nfarmers network.\\nThe network is built through registers that collect local data, such as information of\\norigin and quality of the cattle and beef. The registers convert this information in\\nvaluable knowledge to consumers in any market. That is the core of the added value\\nin information and knowledge for consumers. That is also the key to negotiation\\nstrengths in farmers\\u2019 hands.\\nAs this model is a collective strategy among farmers and processors, with the\\ncoordination and support of provincial and local governments, the first phase of the\\nproject has been financially supported by the government and assisted by experts of\\nthe Buenos Aires University during 2001 and 2002's first semester. The second\\nphase, the 2002 second semester, counted on financial support of local government\\nand the same technical assistance, although caravans purchase for individual\\nidentification was afforded by the farmers. By all means, the roles in this collective\\nstrategy have been functional and dynamic.  It also proves that, slowly but\\nprogressively, those roles are going toward the farmers since they are not only the\\nowners of the business but also the beneficiaries of the gains.\\n3.2.1. Introducing Green Beef Protocol: Phase of Application\\nAfter of almost three years of the project development, important advances have\\nbeen made. The farmers are in charge of handling the information through the\\nNetwork of local Registries. Although the Network is coordinated by Pampas del\\nSalado Regional Consortium and it is carried out through:\\n\\uffff  Collective action\\n\\uffff  Origin and traceability\\n\\uffff  The quality of cattle and beef: Good Cattle Practices\\nThat set is enclosed under the quality protocol \\u201cGreen Beef\\u201d. The university quality\\nmeat laboratory has been working on the standardization of the \\u201cgreen beef: grass\\nfeeding\\u201d protocol. The lab is carrying out the objective and measurable\\ndemonstration of both product and process\\u2019 quality and has developed a sampling\\nmethodology. Standardization is about selecting representative farms and identified\\nanimals, as well as finding out and objectively demonstrating the relationshipI. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\namong Argentine beef quality attributes with agro-environmental conditions and\\nhandling.\\nSo far, the Green Beef protocol governs 11 municipalities--COPRODER and British\\nand Continental breeds--according to quality standards and other issues regarding\\nperformance. These issues involve handling, animal health, weight and age of\\nslaughter, high standards and grades of carcasses (good cattle practices), animal\\nwelfare and others.\\nTraceability is now supported by the National Administration through regulations\\n(years 2002 and 2003) that have been passed as a consequence of European Union\\nrecommendations and that are very helpful to provide a safe environment for this\\nleading case.\\nTraceability starts with animal individual identification and gathering data such as\\nfarmers\\u2019 register number and animal date of birth. Nowadays, calves have been\\nidentified and registered, and are going to be certified taking the data out of local\\nand regional registries.\\nThe definitive Quality Protocol, \\u201cgreen beef,\\u201d has not been finished yet, due to the\\nfact that lab is still collecting and analyzing data and also because some issues are\\nstill under farmer discussion. Quality and traceability are going to be demonstrated\\nand audited using both the parameters/standards and the data objectively\\nmeasured and recorded on the field.\\nSo far, the farmers have settled individual identification, bought the caravans and\\nadjusted the quality protocol in order to certify, at least, calf origin and quality\\nattributes before selling and moving them to another farm.\\n3.2.2  Phase of Human Resources Structural Changes\\nA group of mayors from different municipalities agreed that cattle growing in\\nnatural conditions would be one of the main regional projects. Eleven mayors and\\nrural association members met in order to develop this proposal and in spite of the\\ndiscrepancy of interests. They agreed that this project was going to be the most\\nrealistic for the region.\\nThe facts show that the internal organizational aspect is difficult to accomplish and\\nis particularly difficult in this case, because of the involved actors: 300 farmers,\\nprovincial and 11 municipal governments, technicians from the university,\\nCOPRODER and the rural associations. These organizations make collective action\\nvery complex.I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nFarmers and processors were coordinated by rural associations, supported by\\nmunicipal and provincial governments, and technically assisted by professionals.\\nThey had many meetings before finding the most suitable organizations that meet a\\ncommon interest and make it possible to have collective actions. The decision\\nmaking goes bottom up -from farmers to representatives of local commissions and\\nthe regional consortium- in that order. Those meetings, conferences and workshops\\nwere the common place where all participants exchanged knowledge and expertise,\\nideas and opinions, in order to reach the fitting quality protocol and to develop an\\nappropriate traceability procedure.\\nDissemination among farmers was done in the middle of enormous difficulties such\\nas the most severe floods of the Province of Buenos Aires, the reappearance of foot\\nand mouth disease, the spectacular reduction of the real estate prices, and the\\npolitical and economic crisis of the years 2001 and 2002. That very unfavourable\\nsituation trigger farmer awareness of being the only ones responsible for adding\\nvalue to their products, building competitive advantages and improving their\\nnegotiation capability in the cattle business.\\nSo far, the group of cattle dealers are willing to appropriate the project, and they\\nare strongly convinced of their leadership in the continuity of the process. Besides,\\nfarmers are also aware that either success or failure is under their own\\nresponsibility. Now, they are in charge.\\n3.2.3. Impact of the self-certification model\\nRegarding the European Union and shortly others new countries traceability will be\\nrequired. It is a fact that the entire livestock in Argentina will be affected. The\\nnational government is strongly supporting the project, given that both the\\nAgricultural Secretariat and the National Inspection Service (SENASA) adopted\\nregulations making traceability mandatory for exports. This is a significant\\ninstitutional decision offering an adequate framework to the leading case, since new\\nand fair rules of the game will run the whole business. Furthermore, cattle dealers\\nof the Pampa del Salado are already organized and they can take advantage of this\\nto export.\\nOnce that first experience is consolidated, it is possible to move on to the next goal,\\ndeveloping the denominations-of-origin strategy in order to create competitive\\nadvantages for the entire Argentine beef business. The proposed pathway will be\\nextending from the calves of Pampa del Salado to the young bulls of the Pampa\\nArgentina.\\nTaking into account that many farmers are involved, many opposite interests\\ncoexists, and current businesses are being affected, this project is the most difficult\\nto achieve of the three projects analyzed. The change of paradigm is not onlyI. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nresponsibility of the farmers, it is the responsibility of politicians, technicians, and\\nthe rest of the actors involved of the beef chain.\\nThe collective strategy is very strong and very fragile at the same time. Reaching a\\nconsensus among farmers has been a very tough task, and it has not finished yet.\\nThis leading case is founded on institutional, organizational, and technological\\nchanges affecting the Argentine beef business, and not all of the involved actors are\\nwilling to take sides.\\nThis is also a very ambitious project that, sooner or later, will affect many\\nconsolidated interests and informal business. However, since many farmers are\\ninvolved, the opponents will be restrained to do so openly. Furthermore, this pilot\\nexperience involves almost 65,000 animals against a cattle business that involves\\nalmost 50 million head, meaning there is a long way to go.\\n3.3. Implementation Of Strategic Plan And ISO 9001 (VS 2000)\\nTerminal Quequen S.A. (TQ) is a private port located in Buenos Aires and its\\nagribusiness operations include reception, storage, quality homogenization,\\nblending and identity preservation (IP), and ship load services. Terminal Quequen\\nis implementing ISO 9001/2000 with the main purpose of transforming the \\u201chuman\\nresources\\u201d in \\u201csocial Capital\\u201d as competitive assets by means of ISO\\u2019s certification.\\nTQ was born as a private company ten years ago, after 20 years of being a\\ngovernment-run organization (National Grain Board). The private company was run\\nby a government manager until the last year when a grain business experienced\\nmanager took charge of the position. Plant value is estimated to be about $ 20\\nmillion US. Since the privatisation almost $12 million US were invested from\\ncompany profits.\\nThe company manages 160,000 tons, mainly in maize and wheat operations. The\\nloading activity is concentrated from December to March for wheat and from April\\nto May for maize and it manages almost 80 vessels of 20 thousand ton capacity each\\nand around 50 thousand trucks.\\nArgentina\\u2019s unfavourable economic situation (2001 and 2002) makes the company\\ninvest in human resources as an attractive alternative to add value and\\ncompetitiveness of very low cost rather than to investing in either technology or\\nother matters. Furthermore, since unemployment rose by 20%, and 50% of the\\nArgentine population lives in poverty; the management can not afford any\\nconfrontation with neither the labor union nor with the government.\\nInstead, the general manager chose to implement a new technological model in\\norder to make the needed paradigm change from inside. The challenge to theI. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nmanagement is to convert this \\u201cworkforce in human capital\\u201d which means\\nconverting it in dynamic and competitive assets. Additionally, this process allows\\nthorough inner research of the company technical and human resource problems.\\nThe management is very confident about the construction of competitive advantages\\nthrough the strategic plan and ISO certification. Hence, this would put the company\\nin a better position compared to their domestic and international competitors, being\\nQuality Management ISO standard a remarkable marketing tool, at least in this\\nbusiness. Certainly, the general manager\\u2019s conviction is that the company has an\\ninnovating profile since new ideas and proposals are evaluated constantly.\\n3.3.1. Introducing ISO 9001 (vs. 2000): Phase of Application\\nThe evaluation reported prescriptive recommendations evidencing the differences\\ndetected between the real operation of the organization and the demanded\\noperation in the ISO 9001 requirements. The diagnostic evaluation essentially\\naimed at evaluating the approach used in the definition of methodologies for\\ndifferent processes, remaining for a later step a stricter evaluation of the\\nimplantation degree and effectiveness.\\nThe management gets involved with the development, implementation,\\nmaintenance and continuous improvement of the Quality System. The involvement\\nis demonstrated through the following aspects: assuring that all workers of\\nTerminal Quequ\\u00e9n S.A. understand that the company\\u2019s high-priorities are there for\\nthe satisfaction of:\\n\\uffff  Client requirements,\\n\\uffff  Internal rules requirements,\\n\\uffff  Expectations of the shareholders, and\\n\\uffff  Maintenance of an appropriate worksite environment.\\nAll the processes of Terminal Quequ\\u00e9n S.A. were made to fit in the previous\\nrequests. The management issues and spreads Quality Policy like an explicit\\ncommitment to the values mentioned, and assures the objective is aligned with the\\nPolicy of effective Quality.\\nTerminal Quequ\\u00e9n S.A. defines the Client\\u2019s approach as an essential strategy for\\noperation development. This strategy is sustained and implemented through: a)\\nknowledge of the clients\\u2019 different expectations, b) the systematic translation of\\nthose expectations to requirements, considering operative availability and\\neconomical feasibility, c) the commitment to offer the service fulfilling the\\nrequirements, through parameters within the chain of clients - internal suppliers,\\nd) satisfaction evaluation of the diverse clients, and e) implementation, control and\\nimprovement of the Quality system .I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nThe Operative Procedure is like any cereal and grain stocking and loading company\\nthat operates blending different standards to increase product quality \\u2013\\nhomogenisation-. It also handles Identity Preservation (IP) with identification of the\\nraw materials and products \\u2013from the farm to the vessel-. There is an electronic\\ndata program to trace all operations from truck\\u2019s reception to vessel unloading.\\nThe Administrative Procedure has insufficient software although it has planned to\\ndevelop a program for the works ordered, for cost\\u2019s center, and for storeroom stock.\\nThere is a supplier database and critical suppliers are chosen both by quality and\\nprice criteria.\\nThe Preventive and Corrective Maintenance Procedure is being developed. In fact,\\npredictive and preventive controls are a very large issue related to people safety\\nsince the plant is fifty years old. The old silos do not have temperature and\\nhumidity controls, just the new ones do. Periodic data and statistics are being\\norganized. The company uses calibration patterns and has written a procedure of\\ncritical control equipment and instrument calibration.\\nOnce the previous phase is complete and part of the problems aforementioned\\nsolved; the pre certification and certification will be carried out. The Pre-\\ncertification audit it is recommendable, although non-mandatory.\\n3.3.2. Phase of Human Resources Structural Changes\\nThe Quality Policy assures the provision of both human and material resources for\\nthe appropriate development of the Quality System. Commitment to Quality is well-\\ndefined, also, through the effective leadership of the manager and its closest team.\\nThis leadership is based on unrestricted respect of said Quality Values - the\\nbackbone of operative management.\\nThe company has 102 employees; most of them are from the public sector. In the\\nopinion of private organizations, Argentine workers coming from the public sector\\nhave a culture for working inefficiently. This implies extensive conflict focused on\\nthe coexistence of two very different work site cultures, which makes the operation\\nheavy and slow.\\nThe modified flow chart has been a very helpful tool in reducing obstacles since it\\nhas included a definition of required position competence, personnel profiles, and\\ntraining needs; and thus, responsibilities and functions remain clearly defined.\\nBesides, it makes it possible to detect and eliminate both unnecessary and\\nbureaucratic tasks through the writing of procedures for specific jobs.I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nThe human resources structural change started with initial training focused on ISO\\nintroduction as a tool to bring all employees on line. Oriented and motivational\\nworkshops were arranged to make workers identify their process inefficiencies and\\nto look for potential solutions. As a first experience, all workers were listened to and\\nall opinions were openly discussed, counting on the fact that workers know the\\ntasks they are supposed to perform and the possible solutions to problems as well\\nas.\\nThe following step was internal auditor selection and training, and preparation for\\nthe first internal audit. Part of the management and some employees were willing\\nto be quality system internal auditors, which means self-evaluation and evaluation\\nof other processes.\\n3.3.3. Quality Assurance Impacts\\nWhile the ISO 9001 (vs. 2000) requirements have been almost accomplished, the\\nhuman resource structural change has not happened yet. Certainly, ISO 9001 is a\\nvery useful tool but it must be used progressively. In fact, it can be discouraging to\\ndiscuss employees\\u2019 overt conflicts and dissatisfaction, as management is not\\nstrongly convinced. Moreover, uncertainties and doubts are expected during the\\nimplantation process, knowing that these changes are to break old paradigms.\\nConsequently, commitment and motivation drop and go up alternatively. Things do\\nnot occur overnight and this does not mean either failure or success, not until the\\nprocess is done and has proved it may be maintained.\\nFrom the very beginning, a certain opposition and other obstacles were detected and\\nunfortunately this was happened among managers, those closest to the general\\nmanager.  That restriction comes from management\\u2019s peculiar idea of not sharing\\nknowledge and concealing information, as this means \\u201ckeeping power\\u201d. Still, the\\nproblem is being openly discussed, although as of yet it has not been solved.\\nLikewise, the company has done some benchmarking and research on problems,\\nbenefits, and competitive advantages. It has concluded that despite all the\\ndifficulties it has faced, the process is being improved, sorted out and systematized,\\npeople are getting organised and their profiles are known and fitted according to\\nindividual competence. A new annual training plan -training and performance\\nevaluation- as well as all tools as may be useful for the company efficiency and\\nefficacy, have been settled.\\nIn summary, all those internal movements, changes and worries are avenues\\nleading to Quality Assurance and the satisfaction of shareholders, employees,\\nmanagement and clients.I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\n4. Results & Conclusions\\nSociety at large and, above all, the agribusinesses were affected as a result of\\nArgentina\\u2019s economic and political collapse. Agribusiness executives were forced to\\nlook for new alternatives in the international market since the domestic market was\\noffering neither the possibility to increase incomes nor a certain environment. On\\nthe other hand, international competitor level showed that in order to be\\ncompetitive it was necessary to add value for the creation of competitive\\nadvantages. Technological innovation such as food safety and quality assurance\\nseemed to be the right strategy, as key drivers for competitiveness. As a result, the\\nlocal agribusiness is going through external constraints -due to institutional,\\norganizational and technological limitations- all the way to internal restrictions\\ncaused by cultural, technological and financial insufficiency.\\nBeing competitive not only entails facing the organizational and technological\\nunbalances, compared to international competitors, but also requires a safe\\ninstitutional platform. An unstable institutional scenario with unclear and\\nchanging rules of the game and informal contracts is not a healthy framework for\\nany innovative design, permanently threatening any effort and achievement.\\nOrganizations fail to provide the necessary framework for the development of new\\ndesigns, forcing transactions to operate in an informal economy .  Then, real\\ninnovation requires a transparent business culture and dependence on an\\ninstitutional and organisational frame to provide a formal structure .\\nThe leading cases described show that building competitiveness is to be\\naccomplished from the process of technological approach, taking into account that\\nFood Safety is a road to Quality Assurance and both are keys to building\\ncompetitive advantages.\\nIn the internal context, the situation is no less complex since partnerships in the\\nthree cases mean collective action based on a common vision and values. The\\ndelayed implementation of the proposals is also a consequence of internal\\norganization issues based on the required cultural change. Cultural change may\\ntake years but, despite the delays, it is expected that these leading cases will\\nsucceed in the long run.\\nLimitations and restraints are part of the analysis as they emerge from the complex\\neconomic scenario and from the precarious strategic alliances in which those\\nagribusinesses are inserted. Poor interrelationships among share holders,\\nambiguous rules of the game and low commitment have been the emerging facts of\\nthat collective action . In this context, it was pretty obvious that different levels of\\nimplementation and different impacts on human resources\\u2019 expected change were to\\nbe found.I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nParticularly, in the HACCP model, the external context changed due to the\\nenhancement of the original requirements as a result of European Union more\\ndemanding standards. The HACCP positive impact was that it brought out the\\ncomplexity and uncertainty of the collective strategy and that it made both\\nshareholders and management and SENASA\\u2019s inspector review their lack of\\nresponsibilities and low commitment.  The HACCP system also made evident all the\\nfailures -both technological and operative- in the process. Consequently, all partners\\nare now trying to work out those obstacles.\\nThe impact of the self-certification model of \\u201cPampa del Salado\\u201d confirmed and\\nmade publicly evident that there are contrasting interests at stake, above all, in the\\nmany current informal cattle and beef businesses.  As this is an ambitious project,\\nrepresenting 0.13 % of the total Argentine cattle business, the proposal of extending\\nthe calves of Pampa del Salado to the entire Argentine beef business, will take more\\ntime and more farmer involvement. However, the pilot project could help to\\nintroduce institutional, organizational, and technological changes in the Argentine\\nbeef business. The change of paradigm is not only the farmers\\u2019 and processors\\u2019 duty\\nbut also the duty of politicians, technicians, and of the other stakeholders involved.\\nInternally, the partners to this collective action will have to keep working on the\\nissues that have already come forward and focus on reinforcing their commitment.\\nIn spite of ISO 9001 implantation being almost accomplished, the human resource\\nstructural change has not yet been reached. It is expected that operative\\nmanagement opposition will dwindle as a consequence of both the natural\\nimplantation process and a strong leadership. At the same time, the rest of the\\nworkers are making the service more efficient and doing the necessary efforts to\\nachieve client satisfaction. After all of the tackled difficulties, the process is\\nbecoming more efficient and effective and the satisfaction of shareholder, employee,\\nmanagement and client expectations that is Quality Assurance -which is one of the\\ncompany\\u2019s concerns- is on its way.\\nAlthough the leading cases are undergoing institutional and organizational\\nscenarios of external instability and are internally precarious, their essential\\nstrength is having a clear goal and well defined objectives. The certainty of going\\nstep by step allows both moving forward and expectation of success, all the\\nwarnings having been given. By next June 2003, there will be new developments in\\nsome of the innovation models discussed.  The outcomes thereof will be further\\ndiscussed at that time.I.

The governance structure of food quality assurance in Turkey is explained, which includes public, semi-public and private institutes, laws and legislations, policies and research.  Lack of consumer and producer quality awareness is determined as the main problem by SWOT and Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) studies. A Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) study was conducted by interviewing local stakeholders. Turkish producers' knowledge is limited and their quality perception focuses mainly on food safety. There are barriers in exports due to quality that reduce the Turkish share in world food markets. The study concludes with several recommendations on how problems in Turkish food quality assurance schemes could be effectively overcome.JRC.DDG.J.5-Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom\",\n",

From 2005 to 2007 the JRC-IPTS carried out two projects on food quality assurance \\nschemes in the EU-251. In 2008 and 2009, the JRC-IPTS cooperated with Akdeniz University \\n(UNIAKD) to analyse food quality assurance schemes in Turkey.  \\n \\nIn the study the governance structure of food quality assurance in Turkey is explained, which \\nincludes public, semi-public and private institutes, laws and legislations, policies and \\nresearch. There are five public and one semi-public institution with relevance to food quality \\nand safety in Turkey (the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (TKB), the Turkish \\nStandards Institution (TSE), the Turkish Patent Institute (TPE), the Under-Secretary for \\nForeign Trade (DTM), the Under-Secretary of the State Planning Organisation (DPT), and the \\nTurkish Accreditation Agency (T\\u00dcRKAK)).  \\n \\nA workshop with the participation of key stakeholders was organised in order to carry out a \\nSWOT analysis of the food quality assurance in Turkey. The Logical Framework Matrix \\n(LFM) incorporated the opinions, ideas and contributions of stakeholders. Producer \\norganisations, food processing industry associations and cooperatives in the food sector were \\ninvited to the workshop in Ankara for a broad contribution. The project team moderated the \\nLFM discussion based on the preliminary LFM derived from the SWOT analysis conducted in \\nprevious workshops. Afterwards, a Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) study was conducted by \\ninterviewing local stakeholders and farmers from 12 villages who produce major commodities \\nin terms of the production volume, export value or special characteristics.  \\n \\nA lack of quality awareness of consumers and producers is determined as the main problem \\nfrom the SWOT and LFM studies. Producers' knowledge is limited and their quality \\nperception focuses mainly on food safety. Furthermore disorganised small scale producers are \\nunable to solve quality issues by themselves. Coordination and collaboration among actors in \\nthe food chain are weak in terms of developing and ensuring food quality. Incentives for food \\nquality through complementary procedures or financial support are limited. Therefore it is \\ndifficult for small producers and enterprises to improve product quality, which might result in \\nexclusion from dynamic food markets. Through the RRA studies on the participation of \\nsmall-scale producers in organic farming it was also observed that they voiced limited interest \\nin the subject. Key stakeholders are not sufficiently organised to obtain Geographical \\nIdentification (GI) certification for the important food products in their region. \\n \\nThere are barriers in exports due to insufficient quality, reducing the Turkish share in world \\nfood markets. However, the infrastructure regarding food safety issues, such as minimum \\nlegal requirements, requested by importing country authorities and/or multinational food retail \\nchains, has generally been improved in Turkey. For example, observations show that there are \\ngreat quality improvements in milk production; milk quality now exceeds the minimum Food \\nCodex requirements. The main driver for this improvement is the existence of large scale \\nnational and international dairy companies pushing forward quality standards in the market.  \\n \\n                                                 \\n1 Visit http://foodqualityschemes.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/index.html for more information.  \\n 4\\nThe conclusions of the project lead, among others, to the following recommendations. \\nConsumer and producer quality awareness must be improved to effectively overcome food \\nquality assurance scheme problems in Turkey. Therefore, cooperation between different \\ngovernment institutions, and also media, is required to inform the wider public about food \\nquality. Investment in infrastructure is required of public institutions to further develop the \\nnecessary conditions for the production of safe and quality foods. Marketing campaigns \\nabroad could promote GIs and organic agriculture in Turkey. The EU accession process is \\nsupportive of the development of food quality in Turkey and its continuation will be an \\nimportant driver in the coming years, as will be support from the EU and other international \\norganisations, e.g. the World Bank. Future research may focus on supply chain analysis and \\nobstacles to collaboration between key actors, consumer response to quality in domestic \\nmarkets, and on a model to prevent small scale producers being excluded from dynamic \\nmarkets.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAuthors: \\nAhmet Ali Ko\\u00e7, Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Administrative \\nSciences, Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey \\nSerhat Asci, Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences, \\nAkdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey \\nHami Alpas, Department of Food Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, \\nTurkey \\nFatma Handan Giray, Department of Agricultural Economics, Faculty of Agriculture, \\nSuleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey (formerly JRC-IPTS) \\nStephan Hubertus Gay, European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Institute for \\nProspective Technological Studies (IPTS), Seville, Spain \\n \\n 5\\nTable of Contents \\nExecutive Summary ................................................................................................................... 3 \\nTable of Contents ....................................................................................................................... 5 \\nList of tables ............................................................................................................................... 6 \\nList of figures ............................................................................................................................. 6 \\n1.

Introduction \\nThe Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS), one of the seven research \\ninstitutes of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC), has \\nconducted research on food quality assurance under the idea of enhancing value added to farm \\nproducts. The research was initiated in 2005 by the European Parliament and DG Agriculture \\nand Rural Development asked the JRC-IPTS to carry out a project on 'food quality assurance \\nand certification schemes managed within an integrated supply-chain in the EU-25'. The \\nresearch aimed to (i) identify the driving factors of the EU food industry development and \\ntheir impact on production and trade, and (ii) analyse the advisability of a community legal \\nframework for protection of food quality and certification schemes. The work was structured \\ninto two major steps: (a) stakeholders consultation process, which included a series of \\nworkshops in selected MS, stakeholders' hearing in May 2006 and the final stakeholders' \\nconference in February 2007 to ensure that the analysis was based not only on the best \\nexisting knowledge in the field, but also on the experience and knowledge of the different \\nstakeholders; (b) research studies on food supply chains (dynamics, quality certification, \\nreview of existing studies and methodologies, food quality assurance scheme inventory and \\nthe economic analysis of nine case studies included)2. \\n \\nFollowing the above studies, the JRC-IPTS decided to expand this research on food quality \\nissues to Candidate Countries. The JRC-IPTS has cooperated with Akdeniz University \\n(UNIAKD) to expand the project. The food quality assurance schemes project in Turkey \\nstarted in July 2008 and lasted for a period of seven months.  \\n \\nThis study initially elaborates the governance structure of food quality assurance in Turkey \\nwhich includes public, semi-public and private institutes, laws and legislations in a broad \\nbased perspective, and policies and research on food quality issues. Thereafter, a workshop \\nwas organised with the participation of key stakeholders in order to carry out a SWOT \\nanalysis of the food quality assurance in Turkey. The third activity was focused on building a \\nLogical Framework Matrix (LFM), with stakeholders from the food and feed industry and \\npublic institutions, based on information gathered from the previous three activities and \\ncontributions made by stakeholders. Following these activities, a Rapid Rural Appraisal \\n(RRA) study was conducted by interviewing local stakeholders and farmers in villages \\nlocated at 12 different locations and on nine major commodities in terms of the production \\nvolume, export value or special characteristics. This report provides final conclusions and \\nspecific recommendations.  \\n \\n                                                 \\n2 Visit http://foodqualityschemes.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/index.html for more information.  \\n 8\\n2. Review of the current setting regarding food quality in \\nTurkey \\nFood quality corresponds to food characteristics including external factors (texture, flavour, \\norigin and appearance; size, shape, colour) and internal factors (chemical, physical, microbial) \\n(Grunert, 2002). Food quality also deals with the traceability of raw materials, ingredients and \\npackaging as suppliers and consumers may be susceptible to any form of contamination, and \\nconsumers and retailers also need to trust manufacturing and processing standards. In \\naddition, food quality also deals with labelling issues to ensure the correct use of products, \\ningredients and provide the correct nutritional information.  \\n \\nAgriculture still plays an important role in Turkey\\u2019s economy, even though its share in the \\neconomy has decreased significantly during the last few decades. The agricultural sector made \\nup about 22 % of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) at the beginning of the 1980s, but that has \\ndeclined to around 10 % in recent years. The annual growth rate of the Turkish agricultural \\nsector was 3.4 % in 2009 and 0.08 % in the first half of 2010 (DPT, 2010). Agriculture is still \\nan important buffer against urban unemployment. Total unemployment account for 14 % in \\n2009 and 10.4 % in July 2010, for non-agricultural activities these figures are 17.4 % and \\n13.6 %, respectively. However, nearly 30 % of the economically active population lives in \\nrural areas (DPT, 2009), while agricultural employment accounted for 24.6 % of employment \\nin 2009 and 26.8 % in August 2010, according to the participation in the workforce (DPT, \\n2010). Agriculture, fishery and food products-beverages made up around 8.4 % of the total \\nexport value of 107.2 billion US$ in 2007 (DPT, 2008). \\n \\nThe size of the Turkish food sector is estimated to be 45 billion Euros globally. The food \\nprocessing sector represents a 20 % share in total production of the manufacturing sector and \\ncontributes approximately 5 % to the Gross National Product (Guittard, 2006). According to \\nthe Industry Census of TU\\u0130K in 2002, there are 30 649 enterprises and 247 769 employees in \\nthe food processing sector (DPT, 2007). Most of them are small to medium-size enterprises. It \\nwas also mentioned in the food industry expert committee report that around 10-12 % of the \\nfood processing enterprises are relatively modern and of a large size. Only a small proportion \\nof food processing enterprises firms meet the EU quality norms-standards (Oskam et al, \\n2004). These figures have been improved rapidly during the last few years at the request of \\nmultinational food retail chains and export markets. \\n \\nTurkey has also been a contractor in a series of international agreements related to fair trade \\nrules since 1994. Therefore, some commitments have to be undertaken such as establishing \\nspecial courts to create powerful industrial property rights throughout the country, and \\ntraining and presentation functions must be performed to raise public awareness. For instance, \\nthe 'WTO agreement' and its annex IC 'Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual \\nProperty Rights' and the customs union with the EU were constrained by liability regarding \\npatents, trademarks, industrial design and geographical indications3 (GIs). \\n \\nPolicies dealing with food safety and quality started to develop in the mid-1990s, due to the \\ncustoms union agreement with the EU in 1995, and strengthened during the 2000s because of \\nexports to developed market economies and greater concern over food safety and quality. The \\npenetration of supermarkets into domestic retail markets is another driving force behind food \\nquality and safety (Oskam et al, 2004): simulations of the long-term impact of EU accession \\n                                                 \\n3 GIs cover both PDO and PGI according to the Turkish legislation, similar to the EU quality system. \\n 9\\nsuggest that the increased market access to the EU could generate a significant increase in \\ndemand, in both quantity and quality, that would support significant growth of the agricultural \\nand food sectors in Turkey (World Bank, 2006). Turkey has formally adopted a number of \\ntypical elements of food safety regulations and control systems in the accession period to the \\nEU. There are developments which signal some of the more formal approaches to deal with \\nfood safety and a few available empirical analyses of food safety applications in Turkey, but it \\nis difficult to discuss food quality issues as there is no accessible comprehensive study and the \\ndefinition of quality is even more difficult. \\n \\nThis chapter provides information and describes the current situation of food quality \\nassurance schemes in Turkey. It contains a literature review, projects implemented to improve \\ninfrastructure of food quality assurance schemes, information about main public, semi-public \\nand private organisations, legislations related to food safety and quality, policies supporting \\nfood safety and quality, and information about the current situation of food quality assurance \\nindicators.   \\n \\n2.1. Organisations responsible for the food quality \\ninfrastructure \\nThere are five public institutions and one semi-public one with relevance on food quality and \\nsafety in Turkey. Enforcement of the responsibility of food safety was divided between the \\nMinistry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (TKB) with Decree-Law \\n560 in 1995 and, later, unified at the TKB in 2004 with Food Law No. 5179. Both ministries \\nprepared the framework 'Decree-Law 560' and the Turkish Food Codex together. Until Food \\nLaw 5179/2004, the Ministry of Health and TKB were the two major government \\ndepartments responsible for food safety controls at selling and serving points (the Ministry of \\nHealth) and for the production units (TKB). Both were also responsible for registering and \\ngiving permission to food producing firms, as well as for onsite inspections of food producing \\nplants and food selling points before the 'Food Law No. 5179'. With this new food law, TKB \\nbecame the competent authority for inspecting all food stages from production to \\nconsumption and took over all responsibility for food safety inspections. Inspection and \\nanalysis of drinking water quality and safety remains the responsibility of the Ministry of \\nHealth. However, considering that the EU accession period is one of the most important \\ndrivers of food safety and quality issues, after EU criticism of 'Food Law No. 5179' regarding \\nthe national food codex commission, risk analysis, scientific committees, national food \\nassembly, feedback system, temporally injunction, emergency cases, crises management, \\ntraceability and market monitoring (Giray et al.), a new draft was prepared and submitted to \\nthe parliament in 2009. The 'Veterinarian Services, Crop Health, Food and Feed Law No. \\n5996' (Official Gazette, 13.06.2010; No. 27610) has been approved and enforced since June \\n2010.  \\n \\nThe Under-Secretary for Foreign Trade (DTM) and General Directorate for Standardisation \\nfor Foreign Trade has inspection units at selected points for the issuance of the 'Inspection \\nCertificate(s)' for agricultural products to be exported/imported within the scope of the \\nstandards mandated in exports/imports.  \\n \\nThe Under-Secretary of State Planning Organisation (DPT) is the main decision-making body \\nand is responsible for preparing the Development Plans and Annual Programmes of the \\nGovernment including food safety and quality policies and investment decisions for \\nimproving the quality assurance infrastructure of TKB.  \\n 10\\n \\nThe TSE (Turkish Standards Institution) previously had a very important role in food quality, \\nsince they prepared the respective mandated Turkish standards, conducted conformity \\nassessment tests and issued certificates for the respective food products. But with the new \\nlegislation, their official role is reduced to issuing only Conformity Certificates to food \\nimporters and to conducting auditing activities for the quality assurance systems (ISO 9000s, \\n22000 and so on) established by food producing plants. This latter function is also being \\npracticed by private European firms with regional offices in Turkey (i.e. Bureau Veritas, \\nT\\u00dcV).  \\n \\nMoreover, the Turkish Patent Institute (TPE) acts as a certification and auditing body for \\ntrademarks and GIs. TPE has been established, as an independent legal entity with a special \\nbudget being attached to the Ministry of Industry and Trade with the objective to support \\ntechnological development in Turkey and to protect industrial property rights, as well as to \\nprovide the public with information on industrial property rights, thereby supporting the \\ncultivation of a competitive environment and the development of research and development \\nactivities (www.tpe.gov.tr). \\n \\nIn addition, the Turkish Accreditation Agency (T\\u00dcRKAK) is a semi-public accreditation \\nbody supplying accessibility of standards and quality audits worldwide. T\\u00dcRKAK has been \\nestablished subject to private law provisions, but is linked to the Prime Ministry. T\\u00dcRKAK \\naccredits local and international bodies rendering laboratory, certification and inspection \\nservices, ensures the operation in accordance with established national and international \\nstandards, and thereby facilitates international recognition of product/service, system, \\npersonnel and laboratory certificates (www.turkak.org.tr). \\n 11\\nTable 1: Role of the main institutions in Turkish food quality assurance  \\nInstitution Main related laws  Issue date \\nand number \\nRole in food quality Harmonisation status \\nwith EU legislation \\nStatus \\nMinistry of \\nAgriculture and \\nRural Affairs (TKB) \\n \\nVeterinarian \\nServices, Crop \\nHealth, Food and \\nFeed Law N. 5996 \\n \\nFood Law No.5179 \\n \\n \\nOrganic Farm Law  \\nNo. 5256 \\n \\nITU (GAP) \\nRegulation \\n13.06.2010 \\nNo. 27610 \\n \\n \\n \\n05.06.2004,  \\nNo. 25483 \\n \\n01.12.2004 \\n \\n \\n08.09.2004 \\nNo. 25577 \\nMainly responsible for \\nfood safety, animal \\nwelfare and agricultural \\nproduction. \\n- Food Law does not \\ninclude feed and \\nveterinary concepts. \\n- Not harmonised with \\nthe latest law released \\nin the EU. \\n- idem for requirements \\nof GlobalGAP. \\nPublic \\nTurkish Standards \\nInstitution (TSE) \\nLaw No.132  \\n(establishment) \\n18.11.1960 Responsible for the \\npreparation of Turkish \\nfood standards. \\n \\n- Harmonise some food \\nproduct standards with \\nCodex. \\nPublic \\nTurkish Patent \\nInstitute (TPE) \\nGIs Law No.555 27.06.1995 \\nNo.22326 \\nTrademarks and GIs \\nCertification institute. \\n- There is yet no TSG \\nconcept. \\nPublic \\nUnder-Secretary for \\nForeign Trade \\n(DTM) \\nForeign Trade \\nTechnical Inspection \\nLaw No.4703 \\n \\nCommuniqu\\u00e9 about \\nTurquality support  \\n \\n11.07.2001 \\nNo. 24459 \\n \\n \\n \\n24.05.2006 \\nNo. 26177 \\nResponsible for the \\ninspection of product \\nstandards in foreign \\ntrade. \\n \\nRegulating incentives \\nfor the quality of \\nexported products. \\n Public \\nUnder-Secretary of \\nState Planning \\nOrganisation (DPT) \\nLaw No.4004  \\n(reorganisation) \\n16.06.1994 Responsible for the \\npreparation of \\nDevelopment Plans and \\nAnnual Programmes of \\nthe Government, \\nincluding investment \\nfor improving food \\nsafety and quality \\ninfrastructure. \\n Public \\nTurkish \\nAccreditation \\nAgency (T\\u00dcRKAK) \\nLaw No.4457 \\n(establishment) \\n27.10.1999 Responsible for \\naccessibility of \\nstandards and quality \\naudits worldwide. \\n Auto-\\nnomous \\nMinistry of Health* Law No.1593 24.04.1930 Responsible for \\ninspection, safety and \\nquality of drinking and \\nusage water. \\n Public \\nMunicipalities* Law No. 5216 Law \\nNo. 5393 Law No. \\n5302 \\n10.07.2004 \\n03.07.2005 \\n22.02.2005 \\nResponsible for food \\nsafety inspections at \\nfood selling points and \\nthe food service sector. \\n Public \\nMinistry of Industry \\nand Commerce*  \\nLaw on SMEs \\nDevelopment and \\nSupport \\n12.04.1990 \\nNo. 3624 \\nResponsible for SMEs \\norganisation and \\nsupporting their \\nrequirements. \\n Public \\n* No direct responsibility to ensure food quality. \\n \\n2.1.1.

TKB conducts research, and prepares plans and programmes on the \\nimprovement of agricultural production, and conservation of natural resources such as land, \\nwater, plants and animals. In addition, support of animal breeding, control of food and feed \\nproduction and usage of plant and animal drugs, supervision of services related to food and \\nfeed, control of animal diseases, provision of agricultural services and infrastructure, and \\nrehabilitation of social services related to agriculture are also under the mandate of TKB4.  \\n \\nIn Turkey, TKB is the main responsible institution for food safety. According to Food Law \\nNo. 5179, TKB is mainly concerned with the technical and hygienic aspects in food \\nproduction sites and focuses on the issuing of production licences for food producers and the \\ncontrol of selling and consumption points. TKB also issues control certificates for imports and \\nexports of foodstuffs. In addition, TKB is the contact point of the Codex Committee in Turkey \\nand related product communiqu\\u00e9s. \\n \\nThe food inspection system of TKB is composed of 40 laboratories within 81 provincial \\ndirectorates and over 5 000 food inspectors are carrying out food inspections (Ko\\u00e7, 2007). \\n \\nTKB is also responsible for the general management of the organic fruit and vegetable \\ncultivation system and Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) in Turkey. The Secretariat of \\nOrganic Agriculture and the Organic Agriculture Committee were established in 1993 under \\nthe Department of Research, Planning and Coordination, which is classified as one of the \\nadvisory and control units. Through the restructuring of TKB due to harmonisation of \\ninstitutions for EU accession, the responsibility was taken from the Department of Research, \\nPlanning and Coordination and given to the General Directorate of Agricultural Production \\nand Development in 2003 and a GAP5 (ITU) section was also established in the same unit. \\nCurrently staff dealing with issues on organic agriculture and GAP is employed in the \\nAlternative Agricultural Production Techniques Department. \\n \\n                                                 \\n4 www.tarim.gov.tr; access date: 15.08.2008. \\n5 ITU refers to Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) in Turkish and the ITU standards are regulated by Turkish \\nlegislation. \\n 13\\n \\n \\nFigure 1: Organic agriculture and ITU (GAP) organisation chart in TKB \\n \\nTurkish Standards Institution (TSE) \\nThe Turkish Standards Institution (TSE) was established by Law No. 132 on 18.11.1960 for \\nthe purpose of preparing standards for every kind of item and product together with their \\nprocedure and service. Turkey has been a member of ISO (International Organisation for \\nStandardisation) since 1955. TSE is publically funded, works according to the special rules of \\nlaw and has a juristic personality. Furthermore, authorities have entrusted TSE with \\nrepresenting Turkey within the regional and international organisations dealing with \\nstandardisation. TSE is very active at national level but also at international level (ISO and \\nIEC).  \\n \\nTSE is in charge of preparing standards for every item and product including their production \\nprocedure. The standards set by TSE are known as 'Turkish standards'. These standards are \\nvoluntary and can be made compulsory by the approval of the concerned ministry. It is \\nessential that any standard is a Turkish standard before it can be made compulsory. The \\nstandards made compulsory are published in the Official Gazette. In 2002 there were 18 129 \\nTurkish standards catalogued in TSE and over 20 000 in 2005.  \\n \\n 14\\nIf a firm desires to be accredited by ISO 9000 or ISO 22000, Turkish standards for products \\npublished by TSE have to be applied, and this should be audited by private auditors from \\ncertification firms. There are almost 1750 standards prepared by TSE related to food quality \\nand sanitary aspects. All the standards will be harmonised with EU standards and almost 600 \\nstandards have been repealed by new standards since the 1990s. However, there is no \\nmandatory domestic market inspection by TSE, although TSE contains certification auditors \\nfor products, production, services, laboratories and vehicles (www.tse.gov.tr). Furthermore, \\nall goods imported and exported must be compatible with TSE standards and this is inspected \\nby Under-Secretary for Foreign Trade (DTM) \\n \\nTurkish Patent Institute (TPE) \\nThe Turkish Patent Institute was established on June 19, 1994, based on the power granted by \\nLaw No. 4004 dated 16.06.1994, as an independent legal entity with a special budget acting \\nunder the authority of the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  \\n \\nLegislations were created as a reform feature to undertake liability on patenting, trademarks, \\nindustrial design and GIs, derived from the WTO agreement and its annex the 'Agreement on \\nTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights' (TRIPS) and the customs union with \\nthe EU. Therefore, special courts were established to create powerful industrial property \\nrights throughout the country and important achievements have been made through education \\nand presentations to inform public-oriented users of the system. \\n \\nUnder-Secretary for Foreign Trade (DTM) \\nThe Under-Secretary for Foreign Trade prepared the 'Ministerial Decree on the Regime of \\nTechnical Regulations and Standardisation in Foreign Trade' and its supplementary legislation \\nfor transparency in its implementation, gathering all regulations regarding standardisation \\npolicies in Turkey and establishing a legal base for the harmonisation of Turkish legislation \\nwith EU legislation6 . \\n \\nThe 'Decree on the Regime of Technical Regulations and Standardisation in Foreign Trade' is \\nin conformity with the requirements laid down in the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) \\n'Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade'. It prohibits discrimination among trading partners \\nand aims to ensure that imported products comply with the requirements of human health and \\nsafety, animal welfare or plant life, or the environment.  \\n \\nThe Foreign Trade Technical Inspection Law No. 4703 is related to the controls of \\nagricultural products to be exported within the scope of the standards mandated in exports. It \\nalso determines the framework of import controls, which are regulated by communiqu\\u00e9s in \\nmore detail. The aim of this application, dating back to the 1930s in Turkey, is to protect the \\nprestige of traditional Turkish agricultural products and create stable markets in foreign \\ncountries. \\n \\nThe standards, mandatory in exports, are TSE standards as mentioned before. These standards \\nare parallel to the UN/ECE standards and inspections are performed according to the OECD \\nscheme. Following the inspection carried out by the inspectors of DTM, a control certificate is \\ngiven to the exporter if the product is found to be in conformity with the relevant standard. \\nThe exporter cannot export the product without a control certificate. \\n \\n                                                 \\n6 www.dtm.gov.tr, access date: 16.08.2008 \\n 15\\nProducts will be exempted from inspection if the exporter possesses the 'Certificate of \\nCompetence on Commercial Quality Inspection'. This certificate is issued by the DTM for \\nproducers who are found to be competent in carrying out inspections by themselves. These \\nproducers are subject to periodic and random controls by the inspectorates. \\n \\nUnder-Secretary of the State Planning Organisation (DPT) \\nThe Under-Secretary of the State Planning Organisation (DPT) is affiliated to the Prime \\nMinister. The main duties of DPT are listed as follows: (a) advise the government in \\ndetermining economic, social and cultural policies and targets for the country by taking into \\naccount every type of natural, human and economic resources and possibilities of the country; \\n(b) prepare long-term development plans and annual programmes in accordance with the \\ntargets determined by the government; (c) coordinate activities of the ministries and public \\ninstitutions concerning economic, social and cultural policies, ensure efficient implementation \\nand advise the government regarding policy issues; (d) develop future-oriented strategies by \\nworking closely with international institutions, help reduce uncertainties in the medium and \\nlong-term for the private sector by making policy recommendations in cooperation with the \\nprivate sector.  \\n \\nDPT is responsible for the preparation of the annual investment programme and allocation of \\nthe national investment budget to the food control projects mentioned in the report. DPT is \\nalso responsible for the preparation of development plans and annual programmes of the \\ngovernment for food safety and quality policies. The last development plans on 'food industry' \\nand 'food safety, vegetable and veterinary' were prepared in 2007 for the next five years. The \\nreports were focused on the general situation and future expectations. \\n \\nThe SWOT analysis of the Turkish food industry performed by DPT highlights the \\nimportance of quality problems in the sector. According to the analysis there are two main \\nweaknesses in the Turkish food industry regarding quality: i) there is a real problem in the \\nsupply of high quality and homogenous raw materials, and ii) applications by enterprises of \\nfood safety and quality management systems are not at a satisfactory level. The analysis \\ndefines opportunities in food quality: i) legislation is increasingly oriented towards EU \\nstandards and the preparation for EU accession may have a positive influence on the adoption \\nof further legislation, ii) the Turkish food industry has the potential to process diversified \\norganic and ecological products and iii) food companies are increasingly oriented towards \\ndeveloping quality management systems (ISO, HACCP, GAP) (DPT, 2006). Implementation \\nof geographical indications (GIs) started in 1995 in Turkey. As of January 2009, 107 products \\nare registered with a geographical indication certificate and 65 of them are agricultural and \\nfood products (www.tpe.gov.tr, accessed 31.01.2009). It is obvious that the application of EU \\nfood quality standards through adjustments to food safety, environmental and other standards \\nshould begin in the early stages of the accession process. This is because EU safety and \\nquality standards will need to be implemented progressively, to allow enough time for food \\nprocessors and farmers to prepare, if they have a well-defined and credible timetable, for \\nspecific adjustments.  \\n \\n2.1.2. Autonomous and private bodies (semi-public organisations)  \\nTurkish Accreditation Agency (T\\u00dcRKAK) \\nT\\u00dcRKAK was established in 1998 with 33 employees. T\\u00dcRKAK acts as the major \\norganisation for conformity assessment. It aims to provide information and advice to the \\nprivate sector, particularly in industrial regions which are far from the central decision-\\n 16\\nmaking process. At present, accreditation decisions are taken by an authorized committee \\ncomposed of a general secretary and two deputies. \\n \\n  \\nFigure 2: Accreditation mechanism of T\\u00dcRKAK in Turkey  \\n \\n 17\\nSince April 2006 T\\u00dcRKAK has formed part of the European co-operation for Accreditation \\nMultilateral Agreement (EA MLA) for testing, calibration, inspection and Quality \\nManagement System (QMS) certification. T\\u00dcRKAK has been evaluated for product \\ncertification, Environmental Management Systems (EMS) and certification of personnel. In \\nMay 2006, T\\u00dcRKAK signed the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation - Mutual \\nRecognition Arrangement (ILAC MRA) for testing and calibration. In June 2006, T\\u00dcRKAK \\nbecame a member of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF). \\n \\nTable 2: List of accredited bodies by T\\u00dcRKAK (See Annex B for detailed information) \\nList of accredited firms and institutions  Food related accreditation Total \\nTesting laboratories 27 152 \\nCalibration laboratories - 44 \\nQuality Management System (QMS) 26 37 \\nInspection bodies 2 30 \\nProduct certification bodies 3 6 \\nPersonnel certification bodies 2 8 \\nSource: www.turkak.org.tr  (Access date, 20 August 2008).  \\n \\nThe Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) concept was introduced in Turkey \\nwith the TGKY (Turkish Food Codex Regulation) in 1997. TGKY quite clearly describes the \\nprinciples and application steps of HACCP to be incorporated in food plants to achieve the \\nhygienic conditions defined. All food sectors are foreseen to be covered, but a period of \\nadaptation has been provided before making HACCP compulsory and subject to official \\ninspections. Many food manufacturing and/or retailing companies in different fields of the \\nfood producing sectors started to employ the HACCP system from 1997 on, particularly food \\nmanufacturers exporting to EU countries since it is compulsory in the framework of the \\ncustoms union.  \\n \\nThe HACCP system has become compulsory both for the domestic market and all export \\ndestinations with the 'Regulation on Market Surveillance and Control of Food and Food \\nContact Materials and Responsibility of Food Business Operators' of 30.03.2005 and repealed \\nby the 'Regulation on Inspection and Control of Food Safety and Quality' (9.12.2007, No. \\n26725). This regulation was abolished by the State Council at the end of August 2008 because \\nof incompatibility with Municipality Laws and a new legislation, with the same content, was \\npublished on 26.09.2008. Since 31.03.2008 (Regulation on Inspection and Control of Food \\nSafety and Quality) all food manufacturers must apply the HACCP quality assurance system. \\n \\nISO 22000, a new common standard for the supply of safe food since September 2005, should \\nreplace all HACCP standards. However, it is not expected that ISO 22000 replaces private \\nstandards like British Retail Consortium (BRC) and International Food Standards (IFS). The \\nmain differences are as follows: ISO 22000 could be intended to be used by organisations \\nthroughout the food chain and appears to be less prescriptive than private standards, in that it \\ndoes not address control lists of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), Good Hygiene \\nPractices or other prerequisites in detail. ISO 22000 was published by TSE as TS EN ISO \\n22000 in October 2006. The certification process of TS EN ISO 22000 and other QMS is \\nconducted by T\\u00dcRKAK accredited private certification firms. In addition, the certification \\nprocess of BRC, IFS and other private standards (such as GlobalGAP and Tesco\\u2019s Nature \\nChoice (TNC)) is also carried by these certification firms; however, based on accreditation in \\nforeign countries. \\n \\n 18\\nTable 3: Food manufacturing firms using quality assurance systems in Turkey \\nSub-sector Certificate types Capacity Firms    \\nIFS 20 000 tons/year Ayta\\u00e7 \\nISO 22000 20 000 tons/year Ayta\\u00e7, Ba\\u015fyaz\\u0131c\\u0131. \\nHACCP- TS \\n13001 \\n3 000-99 500 tons/year Alt\\u0131nkaya, Etsan/Apiko\\u011flu, \\u015ealvarl\\u0131et, Y\\u0131lmazlar Et, \\n\\u0130kbal, Sultan Et, Namet, P\\u0131nar Et, Van Et, Alt\\u0131n \\nEt,Maret. \\nISO 14001 99 500 tons/year P\\u0131nar Et \\nMeat and meat \\nproducts \\nISO 9001:2000 3 000-99 500 tons/year  Ayta\\u00e7, P\\u0131nar Et, Alt\\u0131nkaya, Etsan/Apiko\\u011flu, \\u0130kbal, \\nSultan Et, Namet, Ba\\u015fyaz\\u0131c\\u0131, Maret \\nHACCP- TS \\n13001 \\n50 000-240 000 \\nunits/day \\nCP G\\u0131da A.\\u015e., Banvit, Beypili\\u00e7, Er Pili\\u00e7, \\u015een Pili\\u00e7, \\nKeskino\\u011flu, \\u015eeker Pili\\u00e7, K\\u00f6y-Tur, Emre Pili\\u00e7. \\nISO 14001 240 000 units/day, 250 \\ntons/day. \\nCP G\\u0131da A.\\u015e., Banvit, \\u015eeker Pili\\u00e7, Emek. \\nOHSAS 18001 90 000-200 000 \\nunits/day  \\nCP G\\u0131da A.\\u015e, Keskino\\u011flu A.\\u015e. \\nBroiler \\nISO 9001:2000 50 000-240 000 \\nunits/day \\nCP G\\u0131da A.\\u015e., Banvit, Beypili\\u00e7, \\u015een Pili\\u00e7, \\nKeskino\\u011flu, \\u015eeker Pili\\u00e7, K\\u00f6y-Tur, Emre Pili\\u00e7, Lezita. \\nBRC-IFS 30 000 tons/year Tunay A.\\u015e. \\nISO 22000 25 500-250 000 \\ntons/year \\nYa\\u015far Holding (P\\u0131nar), Asya G\\u0131da, Y\\u00f6rsan A.\\u015e., \\nK\\u0131z\\u0131kl\\u0131 A.\\u015e. \\nHACCP-ISO \\n13001 \\n30 000-300 000 \\ntons/year \\nYa\\u015far Holding, Dimes, G\\u00fclsan, Asya, Frigo-Pak, \\nEtap, Yummy A.\\u015e., Yimpa\\u015f A.\\u015e., Tunay A.\\u015e., \\nMeykon,  \\nISO 14001 154 000-350 000 \\ntons/year \\nYa\\u015far Holding, Dimes, Y\\u00f6rsan \\nISO 17025 350 000 tons/year Y\\u00f6rsan A.\\u015e. \\nFruit juice \\nISO 9001:2000 200 000-350 000 \\ntons/year \\nAkman A.\\u015e., Aroma, G\\u00f6knur, G\\u00fclsan, Asya, Etap, \\nTAT, Y\\u00f6rsan, Yimpa\\u015f, Yummy, K\\u0131z\\u0131kl\\u0131, Tunay, \\nMeykon \\nBRC-IFS 2 100 tons/day Ak G\\u0131da A.\\u015e. \\nISO 22000 250 000-450 000 \\ntons/year \\nBah\\u00e7\\u0131van A.\\u015e., Cebel A.\\u015e., Danone Tikve\\u015fli A.\\u015e., \\nEker A.\\u015e., P\\u0131nar A.\\u015e., Y\\u00f6rsan A.\\u015e. \\nHACCP-ISO \\n13001 \\n50-600 tons/day, \\n120 000-150 000 \\ntons/year \\nDimes A.\\u015e., Ekiciler, Enka, \\u0130timat, Kaanlar, Kars-\\nkarper A.\\u015e., S\\u00fcta\\u015f, Teks\\u00fct, Y\\u00f6r\\u00fck, Y\\u00f6r\\u00fcko\\u011flu  \\nISO 14001 120 000-350 000 tons \\n/year \\nDimes, P\\u0131nar, Y\\u00f6rsan \\nISO 9001:2000 150-2 100 tons/day Ak g\\u0131da, Ays\\u00fct, Bah\\u00e7\\u0131van, Eker, Enka, G\\u00fcneys\\u00fct, \\n\\u0130timat, Kaanlar, Kars-Karper, P\\u0131nar, S\\u00fcta\\u015f, Y\\u00f6rsan, \\nY\\u00f6r\\u00fck, Y\\u00f6r\\u00fcko\\u011flu  \\nISO 17025 1 200 tons/day Y\\u00f6rsan A.\\u015e. \\nMilk and milk \\nproducts \\nISO 15161 1 200 tons/day S\\u00fcta\\u015f \\nUSDA Organic 75 tons/day, \\n24 000 tons/year \\nEK\\u0130Z \\nBRC 130.000 tons/year Zade \\nISO 22000 130.000 tons/year Zade \\nHACCP-ISO \\n13001 \\n75 tons/day,  \\n130.000 tons/year \\nTAR\\u0130\\u015e, Ekiz, Zade, Oro-Alt\\u0131n\\u00e7, Heybe \\nISO 14001 130.000 tons/year Zade, Komili \\nISO 17025 130.000 tons/year Zade \\nOlive and olive \\noils \\nISO 9001:2000 24 000-130 000 \\ntons/year \\nTari\\u015f, Oru\\u00e7o\\u011flu, Ekiz, Zade, Oro-Alt\\u0131n\\u00e7 A.\\u015e. \\nIFS 1 350 tons/day,  \\n25 000 m2 \\n\\u00dclker \\nBRC 1 350 tons/day \\u00dclker, Halk \\nHACCP-ISO \\n13001 \\n100 \\u2013 1 350 tons/day \\u00dclker, An\\u0131, \\u015eim\\u015fek, Eti, Halk, Saray \\nISO 14001 600 tons/day Halk, Saray \\nISO 18001 600 tons/day Halk \\nBiscuit, chocolate \\nand candies \\nISO 9001:2000 100 -

Legislation for food quality assurance schemes in Turkey  \\n2.2.1. Food law \\nThe 'Umumi Hifzisihha Kanunu', UHK, (General Code of Health Protection), adapted in 1930 \\nfrom the respective Swiss law, covered regulations regarding official food controls in addition \\nto many other aspects of public health issues. Later in 1952 a new but this time more specific \\nregulation, 'Gida Maddeleri Nizamnamesi', (Food Commodities Regulation), was developed \\nto further cover detailed aspects of food controls to be carried out by governmental bodies. \\nTogether with the individual food commodity standards developed by the TSE (Turkish \\nStandards Institution), following its foundation in 1960, some of which were mandated in the \\nlocal market, these three documents formed the basis of official food controls in Turkey. \\nThere were, however, numerous articles in 'Gida Maddeleri Nizamnamesi' which were \\ncontradictory to the respective mandated Turkish standards requirements, but, in 1982, a \\ndecree was issued indicating that in cases of disagreement between the two, the respective \\nmandated Turkish standards were to be taken as the final judicial opinion, since these were \\nprepared in conformance with the respective international standards on the subject and \\nreflected the latest developments in modern food science and technology (F.L.I.P., 2000).  \\n \\nThe first comprehensive food law in Turkey was Decree Law No. 560 enacted in 1995 which \\ncovers production, consumption and inspection of food, and aiming to protect public health \\nagainst all possible food related risks and inspect food at all stages of the food chain (Alpay, \\n2001(a)). A set of regulations were prepared and published in the Official Gazette, \\nspecifically prepared for the harmonisation of the national food control system with EU food \\nlegislation. The pioneering ones were the regulations describing, in detail, the Good \\nManufacturing Practices (GMPs) in food producing plants in 1996 and the Turkish Food \\nCodex (Turk Gida Kodeksi Yonetmeligi-TGKY) which contains chapters similar to the \\nhorizontal EU legislation, with corresponding specific communiqu\\u00e9s on food additives, food \\ncontaminants, food packaging, food labelling and food hygiene. The TGKY had foreseen the \\n 21\\npreparation of vertical codex documents covering individual commodity types, and with \\nimmediate effect many of these replaced the previously mandated Turkish standards and 'Gida \\nMaddeleri Nizamnamesi' articles. The other important regulation regarding food safety is the \\n'Regulation on Production, Consumption and Inspection of Foods' published on 9.06.1998 in \\nthe Official Gazette No. 23367. This regulation was prepared in accordance with former EU \\nregulation 93/99/EEC of 29.10.1993 on the subject of additional measures concerning the \\nofficial control of foodstuffs and regulation 93/43/EEC on the hygiene of foodstuffs. The \\n'Regulation on Production, Consumption and Inspection of Foods' was the first regulation to \\ninclude the HACCP concept in Turkish food laws. TKB and the Ministry of Health jointly \\ntook responsibility for implementing food safety legislation according to Turkish food \\nlegislation after 1995.  \\n \\nFollowing the release of EU food law Regulation (EC) 178/2002, the food decree-law No. \\n560 was modified and converted into 'Food Law No. 5179' on 27.05.2004 (published in the \\nOfficial Gazette on 5.06.2004, No. 25483). With this new food law, TKB became the \\ncompetent authority for inspecting all stages of food from production to consumption and \\ntook over full responsibility for the inspection of food safety. However, there was a great \\ndifference between EU food law and new Turkish food law. Turkish food law does not \\ninclude feed and veterinary concepts, which completes food safety controls from 'farm to fork' \\nbut rather it keeps them as separate regulations. A new draft law, including feed and \\nveterinary issues, has been prepared to harmonise Turkish food law with EU food laws (see \\nAnnex A for detailed list) and published in June 2010 as \\u201cVeterinarian Services, Crop Health, \\nFood and Feed Law No. 5996 (Official Gazette, 13.06.2010; No. 27610). \\n \\n2.2.2. Laws and regulations to improve quality of agricultural production \\nThe value-added production in crops is related to the quality of reproduction materials with \\nhigh quality and higher genetic potential in line with standards. Therefore, the new Seed Law \\nNo. 5553, which was prepared to amend the Law on Registration, Control, and Certification \\nof Seeds (No.308 and from 1963) in line with the EU harmonisation process and by taking \\ninto account international seed systems and advanced technologies, was enacted on \\n31.10.2006.  \\n \\nWith the 'Regulation for Controlled Greenhouse Production' (27.12.2003 Official Gazette No. \\n25329), Turkey started adapting Good Agricultural Production (GAP) standards related to \\nimportant Turkish export products, such as greenhouse vegetables. Moreover, GlobalGAP \\n(formerly used as EurepGAP) was converted into Turkish legislation and published in the \\nOfficial Gazette No. 25577 as 'Regulation on Good Agricultural Practices' on 8.09.2004. \\nSince this regulation came into effect, a total area of approximately 5 300 ha has been \\ncertified, mainly in provinces in the South such as Adana (3 000 ha), Mugla (5 000 ha.) and \\nMersin (4 000 ha.)7. The requirements of Turkish legislation and GlobalGAP are almost the \\nsame, however, Turkish certifications are not accepted worldwide. Furthermore, additional \\ncertifications are required by multinational supermarket chains such as Tesco\\u2019s Nature Choice \\n(TNC). \\n \\nDecree No. 2005/8503 of the Council of Ministers on 'Supporting Animal Husbandry', which \\nwas amended by the new Decree No. 2008/13695 on 24.05.2008, aims to increase the \\nproduction of roughage, promote the breeding of studs, spread the use of artificial \\n                                                 \\n7 The information on certified areas was taken from Section of ITU (GAP), TKB in May 2008 \\n 22\\ninsemination, and create regions free of animal diseases (DPT, 2006). In addition, works on \\nthe alignment of national legislation on livestock with the related EU regulations are under \\nway. In this context, an animal identification system is almost complete including all livestock \\npopulations in the system. Since 2005, the inclusion of new born cattle into the system and the \\nremoval of slaughtered or deceased animals has been done. A similar effort has commenced \\nto identify the sheep and goat population. \\n \\n2.2.3. Organic agriculture law \\nThe first By-Law of 'Organic Agriculture' was issued in 1994, adopting the EU definition of \\norganic agriculture following the entry into force of Council Regulation (EEC) 2092/91 in \\n1991. An amendment was made to overcome some malfunctions and sanctions were added \\nagainst fault and inaccuracy in organic agricultural activities with regulation No. 22328 on \\n29.06.1995 in the Official Gazette. \\n \\nIn 1999 rules on production, labelling and inspection of the most relevant animal species were \\nintroduced in the EU (Council Regulation (EC) 1804/1999 of 19.07.1999), covering issues \\nsuch as feed, disease prevention and veterinary treatments, animal welfare, husbandry \\npractices and the management of manure. In March 2000 the European Commission \\nintroduced with Commission Regulation (EC) 331/2000 of 17.12.1999 a logo bearing the \\nwords 'Organic Farming-EC Control System'. This logo can be used on a voluntary basis by \\nproducers whose systems and products have been found to satisfy Council Regulation (EEC) \\n2092/91. In Turkey, in 2002 the 'Regulation on Organic Agriculture Principles and \\nApplications' (Official Gazette No. 24812 on 11.07.2002) was enacted, and a comprehensive \\nOrganic Farming Law (No. 5262) has been in force as from 1.12.2004 in line with EU \\nRegulation (EEC) 2092/91. Moreover, a revised regulation came into force on 10.06.2005 \\n(Official Gazette No. 25841), but the Turkish organic agriculture legislation needs further \\nadjustments to comply with the new EU Regulation (EC) 834/2007 of 28.06.2007.   \\n \\nAccording to data published in 2007, approximately 200 000 hectares are used by 14 000 \\nfarmers for organic agriculture in Turkey. The majority of organic production is marketed \\nabroad, primarily in the EU, and exports have been steadily growing. The domestic demand \\nhas started to increase since the late 1990s but is still relatively small to the total food \\ndemand. TKB has the legal responsibility to oversee the cultivation of organic crops.  \\n \\nTKB created a specific Organic Agriculture Committee (OAC), which is the main decision-\\nmaking body. It prepares and implements regulations, authorises certification bodies, inspects \\nthese organisations and coordinates all other activities to improve and foster organic \\nagriculture (\\u0150zkan, 2002). The OAC is composed of representatives of the various \\ndirectorates of TKB. In support to the work of TKB, the Turkish Association of Organic \\nAgriculture, Wheat Association for Ecological Living and Organic Product Producers and \\nIndustrialists Association, provide policy input, contribute to technical improvements and \\ndevelop the domestic market for organic products. The members of these associations include \\nproducers, exporters, academics and consumers.  \\n \\nOrganic farming units have been established in the provincial agricultural directorates. The \\naim is to provide help to certification bodies with specialised staff, to collect data required by \\nstandards, and to perform inspections and certifications of companies as technical auditors. \\nThere are currently thirteen certification bodies established in Turkey.  \\n \\n 23\\nThe export of organic products to the EU requires the registration of a third country as \\ncomplying with a set of rules. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made the \\napplication to be listed as a third country complying with these rules.  \\n \\n2.2.4. Decree-law for geographical indications \\nIn 1992, the EU created systems known as PDO (Protected Designation of Origin), PGI \\n(Protected Geographical Indication) and TSG (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed) to promote \\nand protect valuable food names under Regulations (EEC) No. 2081/92 and (EEC) No. \\n2082/92. \\n \\nPDO protects the name of a region, a specific place or, in exceptional cases, a country, used to \\ndescribe an agricultural product or food product. The product must originate in the specific \\nregion, place or country and possess a quality or characteristics which are essentially or \\nexclusive to a particular geographical environment, with its inherent natural and human \\nfactors. The production, processing and preparation of the product must take place in the \\ndefined geographical area. \\n \\nPGI also protects the name of a region, a specific place or, in exceptional cases, a country, \\nused to describe an agricultural or food product. The product must posses a specific quality or \\nother characteristics attributable to the geographical origin and the production and/or \\nprocessing and/or preparation take place in the defined geographical area. \\n \\nTSG is used for products with distinctive features which either have traditional ingredients or \\nare made using traditional methods (European Commission, 2007). \\n \\nIn March 2005, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) released a panel report regarding the \\nEuropean GI system (WTO, 2005). The conclusions and recommendations of the panel led \\nthe European Union to revise its rules regarding international GIs. Specifically, Regulation \\n(EC) 2081/92 was repealed, and replaced with Regulation (EC) 510/2006. The amendment \\naims to comply with the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights \\n(TRIPS) of the WTO. In particular, the new regulation allows the EU regulatory system to \\nrecognize and protect foreign GIs and allows foreign producers to apply directly for \\nregistration of GI products in the European Union. According to Regulation (EC) 510/2006, \\nto obtain geographical indication certifications, the applicant must apply to its national \\nauthority. After the evaluation, applications are transmitted to the European Commission for \\napproval. Following this procedure, Turkish products can also obtain EU certification, and \\n'Antep Baklavasi' (PGI in 2009) and 'Aydin \\u00cdnc\\u00edr\\u00ed' (PDO in 2010) have submitted their \\napplications in this way.  \\n \\nRegulation (EC) 510/2006 includes more detailed judgments from national legislation \\nregarding the inspection of geographical signs than Turkish Decree-Law No. 555. These \\ninspections have to be executed by independent and specialized control bodies accredited with \\nthe EN 45011 or ISO/IEC Guide 65 standards. This obligation must be accepted by both EU \\nand non-EU countries before 1.05.2010. Therefore, draft legislations have been prepared in \\naccordance with the new EU law and Regulation (EC) 1898/2006.  \\n \\nThe protection of Geographical Indications (GIs) in Turkey is provided by Decree-Law No. \\n555 pertaining to the 'Protection of Geographical Indications' of 27.06.1995 covering both \\nfood and non-food materials and was revised on 7.11.1995. There is no 'Traditional Speciality \\n 24\\nGuaranteed' concept either in this decree-law or in any other regulation compared to \\nRegulation (EC) 509/2006. However, the last draft includes both protection of geographical \\nsigns and traditional speciality.  \\n \\nThe authorized institute for the protection of GIs is the Turkish Patent Institute. As of August \\n2008, a total of 57 agricultural and food products have been approved by the Turkish Patent \\nInstitute. Thirty of the total protected products are agricultural products including grapes, \\nraisins, apricots, nuts, tobacco, cotton, roses, olives and olive oils. Twenty seven of them are \\nprocessed food and alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages including cheese, sausages, \\nprepared meals, candies, desserts, Turkish raki, turnip juice and honey. Moreover, 130 \\napplications for agricultural and processed food are on the waiting list to obtain the \\ngeographical indication protection or designation of origin (www.turkpatent.org.tr, access \\ndate 2 September, 2008). \\n \\nTable 6: Differences between EU and Turkish Geographical Protection Legislations \\nEU Regulations Basic Rules  Turkish Laws Basic Differences  \\nRegulation (EEC) 2081/92 \\nof 14.07.1992 on the \\nProtection of Geographical \\nIndications and \\nDesignations of Origin for \\nAgricultural Products and \\nFoods. \\n- lays down the rules on the \\nprotection of designations of \\norigin and geographical \\nindications for agricultural \\nproducts intended for human \\nconsumption (except wine) \\n- Only a group of natural or \\nlegal persons subject to \\ncertain conditions will be \\nentitled to apply for \\nregistration. \\nDecree-Law No. 555 \\nPertaining to the \\nProtection of \\nGeographical Signs in \\nForce from 27.06. 1995 \\n \\n- covers protecting the natural, \\nagricultural, mining and \\nindustrial products and \\nhandicrafts \\n- Groups, natural or legal \\npersons, who are producers of \\nthe product, could apply for \\nprotection. \\nRegulation (EC) No \\n510/2006 of 20.03.2006 on \\nthe Protection of \\nGeographical Indications \\nand Designations of Origin \\nfor Agricultural Products \\nand Foodstuffs. \\n- Registration of \\napplications from third \\ncountries could be achieved \\nwith the proof that the name \\nin question is protected in its \\ncountry of origin. \\n-A Member State or a third \\ncountry may object to the \\nproposed registration. \\nDraft Law on Pertaining \\nProtection of \\nGeographical Signs and \\nTraditional Speciality \\nGuaranteed Products \\n \\n- includes both geographical \\nsigns and traditional speciality \\n- Only groups could apply for \\nprotection. \\n- regulates the relationship of \\ndomestic with international \\nprotection, e.g. the protection in \\nEU \\n \\nThe protection of Geographical Indications (GIs) is not working properly in Turkey, as there \\nis no specific identification (logo) for products with GIs; only five registered products use \\ntheir own logo. Moreover, the consumption ratio of packaged products is low in Turkey \\ncompared to the EU; therefore the communication of GIs is more difficult in Turkey.  \\n \\nWhen the application of GIs has been made, the distinctive property or detailed identification \\nof the products must be declared. However, some of them are not sufficiently detailed, such as \\nKayseri sausages and dried meat (pastrami) (no specification for the origin of the meat is \\ngiven), while others are well detailed, like Erzincan Tulum cheese (e.g. milk from Karaman \\nsheep and the altitudes of the meadows are given in detail). There are three kinds of olive oil \\nwith a PDO certificate; Edremit Korfez Region olive oil and Ayvalik olive oil have \\noverlapping properties although they indicate different olive oil specialties. On the other hand, \\nspecific olive cultivars are indicated for Guney Ege olive oil produced in the South Aegean \\nRegion of Turkey.  \\nTable 7: Agricultural and food products with PDO and PGI

apply for approval or did not achieve approval.  \\n2.2.5. Law for inspection and standardisation of foreign trade \\nThe 'Decree on the Regime of Technical Regulations and Standardisation in Foreign Trade' is \\nin conformity with the requirements laid down in the Agreement on Technical Barriers to \\nTrade of the WTO. It prohibits discrimination among trading partners and aims to ensure \\ncompliance with the requirements for the protection of human health and safety, animal \\nwelfare or plant health, the environment and national security. However, this was a \\ntransitional regime for harmonisation with the Community legal system. The Regime and its \\nsupplementary legislation were decided on 24.1.1995 by the Council of Ministers and \\npublished in the Official Journal on 9.3.1995. This Decree is amended by Decree No. 96/7794 \\non 'The Regime for Technical Regulations and Standardisation in Foreign Trade' enacted on \\n8.1.1996 by the Council of Ministers. This Decree and its supplementary legislation which \\nconsists of Regulations and Communiqu\\u00e9s were promulgated in the Official Gazette on \\n1.2.1996 No. 22541. The Regulation and Communiqu\\u00e9s are amended every year.   \\n \\nAccording to the Regulation of the above mentioned Regime, there exists a total of 52 \\ninspection units called 'Inspectorates for Standardisation in Foreign Trade', within the eight \\nRegional Directorates (Marmara, Western Anatolia, South Anatolia, Eastern Black Sea, \\nWestern Black Sea, South Eastern Anatolia, Central Anatolia and Eastern Anatolia) under the \\nresponsibility of the Under-Secretary for Foreign Trade (DTM), and the General Directorate \\nfor the Standardisation in Foreign Trade. These inspection units issue the 'Inspection \\nCertificate(s)' for agricultural products to be exported/imported within the scope of product \\nstandards of the Turkish Standards Institution (TSE).  \\n \\nAgricultural products are subject to conformity inspection with regard to 70 Turkish \\nstandards. Formerly, this inspection was only carried out for exports. However the same \\nprocedure is now also applicable for imports. The inspection of agricultural products within \\nthe scope of the 70 standards prior to export and import will be performed by the Inspectors \\nfor Standardisation in Foreign Trade. These inspections are performed according to Turkish \\nstandards which are analogous to the respective OECD and EC standards. Exporters/importers \\nshould obtain an Inspection Certificate from the 'Inspectorates for Standardisation in Foreign \\nTrade'.  \\n \\nIndustrial products are subject to inspection by the TSE with regard to 614 standards, which \\nare applicable on the domestic market in Turkey. Importers should obtain the conformity \\ncertificate from TSE (similar to the CE mark in EC) before importing, since all products \\nshould conform to the relevant standard or regulation or technical document in respect of the \\nminimum requirements of human health and safety, animal welfare or plant health and \\nprotection of the environment, thus providing adequate information to the consumers at the \\nstage of the actual import. If the importer declares that the product is in conformity with the \\nrelevant international standards (ISO, CEN, IEC, CENELEC, ETSI), the Turkish inspection \\nmay be performed upon request according to these international standards. For products \\nalready certified according to the regulations of the European Union ('CE' Mark, 'E' Mark, 'e' \\nMark, etc.) and freely circulating in the European Union, a conformity certificate will be \\nissued directly in case the technical file is submitted to the Turkish Standards Institution \\nbefore importing. \\n \\n'The Regime for Technical Regulations and Standardisation in Foreign Trade' also regulates \\ncontrols to be carried out by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural \\nAffairs and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Pursuant to Communiqu\\u00e9 No.2005/5 \\n 29\\nrelating to human health and safety and Communiqu\\u00e9 No.99/5 relating to human health, \\nanimal welfare and plant health, the importation of certain specific goods is subject to a \\ncontrol certificate by the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. \\nThe scope of these product groups are as follows: \\n\\u2022 Pharmaceutical products, drugs, some consumable medical products, cosmetics and \\ndetergents (Ministry of Health); \\n\\u2022 Food, agricultural and animal products, veterinary products and plant protection \\nproducts (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs).  \\n \\nIn order to fulfil obligations from the customs union with the European Union, for products \\nwithin the scope of Communiqu\\u00e9 No. 25373 of 14.2.2004, and amended in the Turkish \\nOfficial Gazette with No. 25996 of 17.11.2005, bearing a CE mark and freely circulating in \\nthe European Union, a conformity certificate will be issued directly in case the technical file \\nhas been submitted to the Ministry of Health before the import stage.  \\n \\nIn order to obtain a control certificate, a pro-forma invoice for the product must be presented \\nto the corresponding Ministry. Furthermore, depending on the type of the product, the \\nfollowing documents will be presented to the Ministry: a Health Certificate, an analysis \\ncertificate, a formula or list of contents of the product, pedigree certificate, radiation analysis \\nreport, etc. These documents, particularly a health and/or analysis certificate should be \\nobtained from and/or approved by the public authorities of the producer country. They should \\nbe originals and a translation is required for each, including the pro-forma invoice. A control \\ncertificate must be obtained prior to importation and presented to the Customs Administration \\nduring the actual import. The validity of the control certificate remains 6 to 12 months, \\ndepending on the product inspected.  \\n \\n2.3. Policies to support food quality in Turkey  \\nAccording to the Organic Agriculture Law and Implementing Regulation, organic fresh \\nvegetable and fruits are exempted from the rule that all fresh fruits and vegetables for \\nwholesale or retail sale are obliged to pass through market halls. Thus, saving the 14.4 % \\ndeduction applied to the producer\\u2019s price and the hall agent\\u2019s fee of 8 % of the selling price. \\n \\nIn Turkey, basic Direct Income Support (DIS) is given on the basis of the land on which plant \\nproduction is carried out and, since 2005, additional payments are given to the farmers who \\nobtain soil analysis or farm organically. Subsidised credits were in 2004 to encourage farmers \\nto produce organically, according to ITU or perform controlled greenhouse production.    \\n \\n 30\\nTable 8: Agricultural subsidy for quality improvement9 \\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Subsidy and \\npremiums  (M TL) (M TL) (M TL) (M TL) (YTL) (YTL) (YTL) (YTL) \\nDirect Income Support \\n(DIS) (da)* 10.00 13.50 16.00 16.00 16.00 16.00 10.00 10.00 \\nSoil analysis addition \\nto DIS (da) - - - - - - 1.00 1.00 \\nOrganic Farming \\naddition to DIS (da)  - - - - - - 3.00 3.00 \\nBombus bees support \\nin greenhouse \\nproduction (colony)  \\n- - - - - - - 50 \\nUse of certified seeds \\nand saplings - - - - \\n6 \\nproducts \\n6 \\nproducts \\n11 \\nproducts \\n11 \\nproducts \\nAdditional premium for \\nusing certified seeds  \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean  \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nSupport to certified \\nseed production for \\nfeed \\n- - - - - - 3 products \\n3 \\nproducts \\nSubsidised credit (deduction ratio on Agricultural Bank credit interest rate) \\nControlled greenhouse \\nproduction - - - 40% 40% 40% 40% 40% \\nITU (GAP) - - - - - 60% 60% 60% \\nOrganic Farming  - - - - - 60% 60% 60% \\nCertified seed usage - - - - - 60% 60% 60% \\nCertified fruit saplings - - - - - 50% 50% 50% \\nCertified seed \\nproduction - - - - - 50% 50% 50% \\nBio-safety in poultry - - - - - 60% 60% 60% \\nSource: based on TKB annual support data. \\n* DIS does not contribute to quality production itself.  \\n \\nAgricultural support for controlled greenhouse production and ITU (GAP) is only subsidised \\nthrough credits. In the case of controlled greenhouse production, a 40% deduction is taken \\nfrom the 17.5% nominal interest rate of the Agricultural Bank. Furthermore, a 60% deduction \\nis applicable in case of organic farming or certified ITU (GAP).  \\n \\n2.4. Literature review and projects implemented on food quality \\nin Turkey  \\nThere is no comprehensive study on food quality assurance schemes in Turkey as food quality \\nhas only recently become an important issue. Food quality has become increasingly important \\ndue to standards in importing countries, including the EU and the Russian Federation food \\nsafety legislations, and standards of private global retailers' such as Kipa-Tesco, CarrefourSA \\nand Metro Group in the domestic market. Also consumers' fears about food scares stemming \\nfrom diseases such as avian influenza increased the importance of food safety and quality. \\nGenerally, quality is mainly perceived as food safety and additional attributes are less in the \\nfocus of the Turkish agricultural and food sector. Important available reports and research \\npapers on food quality and safety issues are discussed as follows. \\n \\nPreviously Alpay et al (2001(b)) discussed the harmonisation of Turkish quality assurance \\nprocedure with EU quality standards. The competitiveness of the Turkish food industry in the \\nEU market was analysed from a quality, food safety and environmental perspective. An \\nimpact analysis of HACCP adoption by food industry on export performance was conducted. \\n                                                 \\n9 (1) decare (da) is equal to 0.1 hectare (ha), and 1 Euro = 1.80 YTL = 1 800 000 TL, approximately. \\n 31\\nEmpirical analysis of the data from a survey of 92 food firms indicated that the main \\ncompetitive factors for the Turkish food manufacturing firms in the EU market were: costs, \\nimproving product quality and adapting food safety standards.  \\n \\nDolekoglu (2003) performed a survey of 302 households in Adana to clarify consumers' \\nunderstanding of food quality preferences, safety requirements and basic product properties. It \\nwas found that consumers' preferences on food quality (especially for trusted trademarks) \\nwere as important as the price of the products in various markets. Moreover, economic \\nfeatures should be improved to supply access to more safe and nutritional food for basic \\nrequirements of people's diets. Dolekoglu also indicated that it is essential for producers, \\nretailers and consumers to be informed and advised about quality, safety and even consumers' \\nrights. \\n \\nOskam et al. (2004) carried out a study to provide a comprehensive overview of Turkey\\u2019s \\nagricultural and food sectors and the situation in its rural areas which was then used to \\nexamine potential consequences of Turkey\\u2019s EU accession. It was reported that Turkey\\u2019s \\naccession to the EU offers certain opportunities to the agricultural and food sectors such as \\nincreasing security and political stability in the south eastern region of the EU in the scope of \\nillegal movements of goods, livestock and people across these borders. In addition, there are \\nstrong opportunities for the profitable export of goods, services, know-how and capital to the \\nTurkish market from the EU. Moreover, Turkey has a large territory rich in biodiversity, and \\nwith less environmental problems than many EU members. \\n \\nGuittard (2006) prepared a report on the food safety situation in Turkey. The main results of \\nthe report are the following. Despite the significant ongoing efforts to improve the Turkish \\nfood safety situation, many gaps need to be filled. More cooperation between the agricultural \\nsector and industry would be a key factor to improving food safety in the food chain. The \\ngoodwill demonstrated by Turkish authorities in openly cooperating with international bodies \\nprovided them with an extremely valuable learning process. With the experience gained they \\nare now much better prepared to manage future crises and communicate risks more effectively \\nand quickly. In order to execute the tasks required under the food safety acquis, it seems \\nnecessary to restructure and strengthen TKB. Special attention should be paid to reinforce and \\nupgrade the control systems. Food processing operations should be improved with regard to \\ntechnical and hygienic conditions. \\n \\nThe State Planning Organisation (DPT) of the Prime Minister published two special \\ncommission reports entitled 'Food Industry Expert Committee Report' and 'Food Safety, \\nPhytosanitary and Veterinary Expert Committee' for the 9th Development Plan (2007-2013) \\n(http://ekutup.dpt.gov.tr/oik/plan9.asp, accessed August 2008). The food safety, phytosanitary \\nand veterinary report extensively focused on food safety while the food industry report \\nfocused on the preparation of the Turkish food industry for competition in the EU market. It \\nwas also highlighted that the competitiveness of the industry for export, through science and \\ntechnology, should be increased. The food industry report mentioned that quality analyses, \\nR&D activities, consulting and training activities have been major accomplishments during \\nthe last decade. The following results have been highlighted in the reports to better prepare \\nthe food industry sector during the accession period:  \\n\\u2022 increase non-governmental organisation and private sector initiatives in the \\nproduction-consumption chain; \\n\\u2022 reduce raw material costs by tax regulations and prevent unregistered production; \\n 32\\n\\u2022 decrease raw material costs via productivity gains and competitive input price for \\nenterprises enabling competitiveness, hygiene and coherence with EU standards; \\n\\u2022 constant supply of animal- and plant-based raw material at affordable prices, fulfilling \\nhygiene and safety standards; \\n\\u2022 increase of food related R&D activities in public investment expenditure; \\n\\u2022 encouragement of industries to invest in science, technology and R&D; \\n\\u2022 an efficient control of the food chain from 'farm to fork' by protecting the rights of \\nboth the producer and consumer. \\n \\nG\\u00f6nen\\u00e7 (2007) published a research paper entitled 'preventive factors which distort the \\nprotective mechanism of Geographical Indications'. The author conducted a consumer survey \\nof 570 households in the Bursa Province on Gemlik Olives certified with 'Protected \\nDesignation of Origin' (PDO) and a producer survey on Mustafa Kemal Pa\\u015fa Tatl\\u0131s\\u0131 (dessert) \\ncertified with PGI. The author also reviewed distinguishing or differentiating attributes of \\ncertified products in the official documents. She concluded that the lack of consumer and \\nproducer information about GIs and also inefficiently defined distinguishing attributes of \\ncertified products are the major factors hindering the spread of GIs. \\n \\nG\\u00f6nen\\u00e7 (2006) also published a research paper entitled 'Geographical Indication in European \\nUnion and Turkish olive sector and the role of producers' organisation'. The author compared \\napplicants for PDOs in EU Member States and Turkey. She indicated that PDO applicants in \\nthe olive sector are cooperatives, chambers of commodity exchange markets and chambers of \\ncommerce in Turkey as opposed to cooperatives and producer unions in EU Member States.  \\n \\nKo\\u00e7 (2006) prepared a report on the Turkish food quality management system that includes \\nthe evaluation of food safety and quality legislation in Turkey. Moreover, he provided case \\nstudies from different sectors such as the tomato processing, broiler and dairy sectors. Finally, \\nhe conducted a SWOT analysis on the tomato industry. The report indicated that Turkey has a \\nlong history of successful quality management of food safety and quality in certain food \\nsectors, which has been evolving rapidly.  \\n \\nTekelioglu and Demirer (2008) documented the historical evolution of Geographical \\nIndications (GI) in Europe and compared the EU and Turkish legislation, and the current \\nsituation of PDOs and PGIs. They provided an inventory of PDO and PGI certified products \\nby country and commodity groups both in the EU and in Turkey. Moreover, it was also \\nindicated that 60% of Turkish agricultural export earnings are composed of GI protected \\nproducts such as Giresun hazelnuts, Malatya apricots, Sultani raisins, Ege figs and Antep \\npistachio nuts.  \\n \\nAvailable technical reports and studies focus mainly on food safety and highlight the \\nimportance of food quality and safety for exports and in the accession process to full EU \\nmembership. As seen from the literature review, food quality assurance schemes in Turkey \\nhave not been comprehensively analysed, including economic feasibility of quality protected \\nproducts, compliance cost for producer by scale, factors and policies preventing development \\nof collectively managed quality brand and so on.  \\n \\nTable 9: Implemented projects  \\nName of the project Participating \\ninstitutions and \\norganisations \\nSource of funding and \\nbudget \\nPeriod Objectives Indications or results \\nEU programme 'Support to \\nthe Quality Infrastructure \\nin Turkey' project \\nThe Under-Secretary of \\nForeign Trade, \\nDirectorate General for \\nStandardisation (DG) and \\nTurkish Society for \\nQuality (KalDer) \\n\\u20ac 13 million funded by the \\nDelegation of the European \\nCommission to Turkey and \\nmanaged by the European \\nCommittee for \\nStandardisation (CEN), \\nthrough the Expertise Centre \\n(ExC) in Ankara and \\nadministered by the British \\nStandards Institution (BSI). \\nStarted in \\nJuly 2002 and \\nended in \\n2007 \\nThis project was designed to support \\nTurkish private and public sectors, in the \\nprocess of technical harmonisation and \\naligning their quality infrastructure with that \\nof the EU in relation to the Customs Union, \\nmore specifically related to technical \\nbarriers to trade. \\nThis project extensively focused on standardisation and \\naccreditation, including testing, certification, inspection \\nand metrology.

SWOT analysis of the food quality assurance schemes \\nin Turkey \\nThe workshop on 'Food Quality Assurance Schemes in Candidate Countries: Turkey' (FQAS-\\nTURK) was held in Antalya on 7 and 8 October, 2008 in the meeting hall of the Faculty of \\nEconomics and Administrative Sciences (FEAS). \\n \\nThe aim of the workshop was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the existing food \\nquality system in Turkey. In order to fulfil this purpose, institutions related to food quality in \\nTurkey as well as NGOs were invited. Representatives of different departments of the \\nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA), the Turkish Patent Institute (TPE), the \\nRegional Exports Union (Antalya), the Undersecretary for Foreign Trade (DTM), the Turkish \\nStandards Institution (TSE), the National Productivity Centre (MPM), the Mercantile \\nExchange (Izmir), private companies and academics from universities participated in the \\nworkshop (Annex C. Participant list). \\n \\nThe workshop was officially opened with the welcome speeches of Prof. Dr. A. Ali Ko\\u00e7 and \\nDean of the FEAS, Prof. Dr. \\u015eafak Aksoy; then Dr. Fatma Handan Giray from JRC-IPTS \\npresented the project 'Economics of Food Quality Assurance and Certification Schemes \\nmanaged within an integrated Supply Chain in EU' carried out by the Institute of Prospective \\nTechnological Studies, one of the institutes of the European Commission's Joint Research \\nCentre (EU JRC- IPTS), and the objectives and structure of the FQAS-TURK project. The \\nmorning session was completed with the presentation of Serhat A\\u015f\\u00e7\\u0131 summarizing the first \\nphase of the project and providing detailed information about the mechanisms of the current \\nTurkish food quality assurance and outcomes of other related projects and academic reports. \\n \\nIn order to determine the strengths and weaknesses of Turkish food quality schemes, the \\nanalysis was made on three basic topics as follows: \\n1) the gathering of information on food quality assurance certification systems (working \\nprinciples);  \\n2) existing discussions on and potential interests in EU food quality systems (PDO, PGI, \\nTSG);  \\n3) analysis of potential food products that can compete with those in the EU markets. \\n \\nIn this workshop, a SWOT analysis and a Logical Framework Approach (LFA) were used to \\ncollect data from workshop participants. A SWOT analysis is used to identify and categorize \\nsignificant internal (Strengths and Weaknesses) and external (Opportunities and Threats) \\nfactors. Therefore, only Strengths and Weaknesses were obtained directly from participants \\nfor the Turkish food quality assurance scheme, and Opportunities and Threats were derived \\nfrom these answers.  \\n \\nFirstly, the Turkish terminology for food quality assurance was discussed as some \\norganisations were using different definitions for food quality, food safety and food security \\nin Turkey. Therefore, all participants had to define food quality and assurance. Definitions \\nwere collected and a common idea was reached with regards to the meaning of these terms. \\n \\nFor the other parts of the SWOT analysis, papers were distributed and, Strengths and \\nWeaknesses were examined in the three parts. Firstly 'information on food quality assurance \\ncertification system' focussed on the current situation of the working principles of institutions, \\n 36\\norganisations and mechanisms. Secondly 'existing and potential interests to EU food quality \\nsystems' looked to current and future expectations of Turkish firms and institutions regarding \\nfood quality systems. Finally 'potential food products able to compete with those in the EU \\nmarkets' elaborated on the competitiveness of Turkish products. \\n \\nAfter obtaining the data from the SWOT analysis, Weaknesses and Threats were taken as \\nproblems as a basis for the Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) analysis. Problems were listed \\nand the cause and effect relationship between them were established by participants with the \\nsupport of a professional moderator (Chapter 4).  \\n \\n3.1. Results of SWOT analysis \\nThe analysis procedure was detailed in three parts: \\n1) the gathering of information on food quality assurance certification systems;  \\n2) existing discussions on and potential interests in EU food quality systems;  \\n3) analysis of potential food products that can compete with those in the EU markets. \\n \\nTables were prepared after the discussions according to the opinions of the working group and \\nthereafter, these opinions were clustered. \\n \\n 37 \\n3.1.1.

Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) analysis of food \\nquality assurance schemes in Turkey  \\nAt the third stage of the project 'Food Quality Assurance Schemes in Candidate Countries: \\nTurkey' (FQAS-TURK), a workshop was organised in the Culture and Convention Centre at \\nthe Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara on 26 November, 2008 (Annex D: \\nAgenda and participants list). The aim of the workshop was to inform participants about the \\nprevious stages of the project and to elaborate the preliminary Logical Framework Matrix \\n(LFM) obtained from the first workshop held in Antalya.  \\n \\nIn order to satisfy the above mentioned objectives, the essential participants invited for the \\nworkshop were: SET-BIR (Union of Dairy, Beef, Food Industrialists and Producers), BESD-\\nBIR (Poultry Meat Producers and Breeders Association), TURKYEM-BIR (Turkish Feed \\nManufacturers\\u2019 Association), Union of Food and Beverages Industrialists, Consumers\\u2019 Union, \\nProducer Cooperatives (Koy-koop, TARIS etc), Regional and Central Producer Unions \\n(Dairy, Vegetable, Fruit, Greenhouse etc), Food Safety Association, Organic and Ecological \\nProduction Associations, Chambers of Food and Agricultural Engineering. Most of the \\ninvited organisations and institutes attended the workshop.  \\n \\n4.1. Methodology \\nThe Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) incorporated opinions, ideas and contributions of \\nstakeholders. Producer organisations, food processing industry associations and cooperatives \\nin the food sector were invited to the workshop in Ankara for a broad contribution. The \\nproject team moderated the LFM discussion based on the preliminary LFM which was \\nextracted from previous workshops based on data from the SWOT analysis.  \\n \\nThe LFM workshop started with the opening speech of Prof. Dr. A. Ali Ko\\u00e7. Thereafter, \\nSerhat A\\u015f\\u00e7\\u0131 presented the outcomes of the first phase of the project on current Turkish food \\nquality assurance schemes, related projects and academic studies. Secondly, the SWOT \\nresults related to Turkish food quality assurance schemes were presented by Assoc. Prof. Dr. \\nHami Alpas and field findings were shared in a presentation made by Prof. Dr. A. Ali Ko\\u00e7 \\ntitled 'Interest, Knowledge Level and Expectations of Local Stakeholders and Producers from \\nFood Quality Assurance Systems in Turkey'.  \\n \\nThe preliminary LFM results were explained; and the specific analysis techniques and \\nmethodology were presented. Secondly, the problems of food quality assurance schemes and \\npreliminary sub-topics were detailed by the project team. At that point, opinions and \\ncontributions of participants were gathered and some changes to the sub-topics were made for \\nclarification. The preliminary problem list was rearranged according to some minor changes \\nand formed the basis for further work. Moreover, cause-result relationships and major/minor \\nproblems, obtained from the preceding work, were assessed and contributions obtained. At \\nthe second stage, a problem tree was generated. At the final stage, the audience focused on the \\nLFM table. Each subject was discussed intensively on a matrix table and participants' \\ncontributions and opinions for the missing parts were gathered by the project team. \\nDiscussion was sustained until each part of the matrix table was approved by the participants. \\nAt the end of the workshop, the final LFM was presented once more and participants' final \\napproval was obtained. \\n \\n 41\\nAdditions to the preliminary LFM are as follows. The issues in the preliminary problem list \\nwere not changed but rearranged; (1) 'labelling' was added to consumer trust, (2) 'lack of \\nimplementation and auditing after certification process, especially in geographical indications \\n(GI\\u2019s)', were added to make this point more complete. The cause-effect relationship was \\ndeeply discussed and one of the minor problems was divided into two following the \\ndiscussion with participants: 'legislation' and 'coordination among food chain players'. Thus, \\nthe cause-effect table and problem tree were revised with minor changes. Therefore, the LFM \\nwas adjusted accordingly. The LFM was also improved with the addition of new assumptions \\non overall and specific objectives; (1) infrastructure investments to improve food quality \\nassurance schemes will be sustained by TKB (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs) and \\nrelated institutes in order to fulfil the demands of the markets, (2) improvement of the quality \\nassurance and traceability system will be sustained according to the demand of export \\nmarkets, (3) organisation campaigns intended to raise public awareness, supported by sector \\nassociations (NGOs), TKB and other public institutes. Moreover, 'traceability applications of \\nfood manufacturing SME' was added to the LFM, with measurable indicator, verification tool \\nand assumption. \\n \\n4.2. Results of the Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) for Turkish \\nfood quality assurance schemes \\nFor the construction of a Logical Framework Matrix (LFM), it is essential to list the main \\nissues of the subject of interest. Therefore, a problem list was prepared based on the findings \\nof the SWOT analysis. All weaknesses and potential threats were discussed and reduced to \\neleven important problems as indicated below: \\n \\nProblem List: \\n1. Lack of quality awareness both on the producer and consumer side \\n2. Export problems due to quality problems \\n3. Lack of coordination and communication between different entities \\n4. Insufficient and inappropriate quality certification and labelling audits \\n5. The quality certification takes time and is expensive (brand, geographical indications \\n(GIs), organic logo, ITU (GAP), etc.). Lack of implementation and auditing after \\ncertification, especially for GI\\u2019s \\n6. Financial weaknesses of SMEs and agricultural holdings \\n7. Lack of awareness about national and international quality applications \\n8. Lack of incentives for quality in production (e.g. GIs)  \\n9. Lack of institutional capacity e.g. R&D (academia, governmental bodies and private \\nsector)  \\n10. Marketing and advertisements are not sufficient even for the products that have a high \\nchance to compete \\n11. Overlapping of legislation among different implementation authorities \\n \\nAs a prerequisite, bureaucracy and low level of income have not been taken into consideration \\nin the problem analysis since it is not possible to approach these problems in this framework. \\n \\n4.2.1. Cause-effect relation \\nThe problems were evaluated by participants to detect the main problem and the interaction \\nbetween problems. Consequently, some problems were found to be the cause or effect of \\n 42\\nothers. Finally, one main and six minor problems were identified. Furthermore, some changes \\nwere made to the description of problems. \\n \\nTable 13: Cause-effect relation of main and related problems \\nMain Problem \\n1. Lack of quality awareness of the producer and the consumer \\nCause: Lack of familiarity with national and international quality application procedures (quality management systems, EU \\nfood quality systems [TSG, PDO and PGI], guarantee brands [e.g. wool mark] and others.) \\nEffect: Low interest in food quality assurance \\nSolution: Improving the food quality awareness level of the producer, consumer and important actors in the food chain.  \\n \\nMinor Problems Cause: Solution: \\n1. Difficulties in exports due to quality \\nproblems \\n \\nLack of information, experience, \\ntechnology, training of producers  \\nSupporting organisational structure and \\ntechnology use, designing training \\nprogrammes  \\n2. Conflict in legislation (overlapping) \\n \\nGaps and overlapping in distribution of \\nduties and responsibilities between \\ninstitutions  \\nThe authority and responsibilities of \\nthe bodies should be reviewed in this \\nrespect \\n3. Lack of trust in quality certification \\naudits and labelling  \\n \\nLack of resources (technical, human \\nresources, motivation), lack of \\ninternationally recognised certification \\nsystem and accreditation \\nSupplying the required equipments to \\nthe auditors, training of more experts, \\nincreasing the budget and extend \\naccreditation efforts \\n4. Financial weaknesses in SMEs and \\nagricultural holdings \\n \\nBudget constraints, traditional \\nmanagement methods, certification of \\nquality (branding, GIs, ITU, organic \\nlogo etc.) is not affordable (costly and \\ntakes long) \\nClustering (unit and top organisation), \\nto facilitate credit for small scale firms \\nand grants from international financial \\nsources  \\n5. Lack of incentives towards quality \\nproduction and products (e.g. GIs) and \\nlack of implementation after the \\ncertification process \\n \\nLack of organisation on producer level \\nand cooperation in the marketing \\nchain, institutional R&D etc., low \\ninterest (academia, governmental \\nbodies, private sector), lack of \\nagricultural support schemes  \\nDesigning agricultural support to \\nstimulate quality production, \\nsupporting marketing of competitive \\nproducts and product advertisements \\n6. Lack of coordination among actors \\nin the food chain \\n \\nLack of coordination and cooperation \\namong institutions and key \\nstakeholders in the food chain \\nImprove coordination among different \\nkey sector stakeholders and increase \\nthe number of audits by authorized \\nbodies \\n \\n4.2.2. Problem tree  \\nIn the procedure to construct the final LFM, it was agreed that a problem tree could be useful. \\nThis problem tree would identify the problem the participatory group considered the most \\ncritical. In addition, there is also the identification of the other concerns associated with the \\nmain problem and the hierarchical structure. The schema highlights the cause-effect \\nrelationship between all the discussed issues. \\n \\n 43\\n \\nFigure 4: Problem tree \\n \\n4.2.3. Logical Framework Matrix (LFM): food quality assurance schemes in Turkey \\nFinally, the LFM was developed using the results of the previous evaluations. As indicated \\nbefore 'a lack of quality awareness of consumers and producers' was agreed as the central \\nproblem requiring solutions. The approach accessed possibilities to overcome specific \\nobjectives, and these were spelled out and specific measures attached.

Farmers\\u2019 knowledge, perception and interests about \\nfood quality assurance schemes: Rapid Rural Appraisal \\n(RRA) results \\nInformation and socio-economic data on producers of selected agricultural products were \\nobtained using the Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) method. The data were analysed in order to \\nexplore the current status of food quality assurance practices, awareness, knowledge and \\nperception of local stakeholders. To serve this purpose, nine products and twelve regions were \\nselected (Figure 5; Table 15). In each selected region, interviews were arranged with \\nimportant regional and/or local stakeholders and a representative village (or town), with \\nrespect to the overall region was determined during the interviews with key stakeholders such \\nas the provincial agricultural directorate or producers\\u2019 organisations. The RRA was conducted \\nwith producers\\u2019 panels composed of at least 8-10 participants. The demographic structure of \\nthe villages and the farm households, improvements and investments in production techniques \\nand progress in product quality were addressed. A semi-structured questionnaire (See Annex \\nA) was prepared to obtain basic descriptive information and data related to the main aims \\nmentioned above. In the first part of the questionnaire, questions on the demographic structure \\nof the selected villages and the economic situation of the producers were asked. The questions \\nof the second part aimed to explore the knowledge of the producers about their product and its \\nquality as well as the producers\\u2019 interest in quality issues and their expectations for \\nimprovements of their product quality in the near future. The RRA study regions were \\nselected according to the importance of the products in terms of production volume in \\nnational agriculture and/or the reputation of the region for the respective products. Interviews \\naimed to obtain information on the production process, farm structure, developments in terms \\nof food quality and safety, recent production and trade data on representative production \\nregions in the province and/or sub-province. Moreover, the key food players were informed \\nabout the FQAS-TURK project and they were invited to the workshop in Ankara where they \\nwould be able to share their knowledge and opinions for completing the Logical Framework \\nMatrix (LFM) analysis. \\n \\n \\nFigure 5: Map of RRA studies in Turkey \\n \\n 47\\nTable 15: Selected areas and their importance in Turkish agricultural \\nProduct Province (sub-province) Description \\nBeef Afyonkarahisar 5.3 % of national registered cattle and buffalo meat in 2005, \\nrespectively; two meat products have a GI certificate  \\nOlive and olive oil  Bal\\u0131kesir (Ayvalik) Recent data indicates 9 million olive trees, 173 000 tons \\nproduction and 71 000 hectares; there is also olive oil certified \\nwith GI \\nTomato Antalya (Kumluca) 20 % of national production and more than 50 % of greenhouse \\nproduction and exports \\nApple Isparta (Egirdir) 25 % of national production \\nGrape and Raisin Manisa (Alasehir) 30 % of grape production and more than 50 % of raisin \\nproduction  \\nDried Fig Ayd\\u0131n 60% of national production   \\nDried Apricot Malatya More than 90% of national production \\nCitrus Antalya (Finike) Important production location and export points, including Finike \\nOrange with GI certification \\nCitrus Mersin Important production location and export points \\nMilk Afyonkarahisar 2.6 % of national milk production in 2005 \\nMilk Burdur 1.7 % of national milk production in 2005 \\nMilk Konya & Karaman About 5 % of national milk production in 2005; including a local \\ncheese with GI certification \\n \\nIn light of the information obtained from the interviews with key local stakeholders, the semi-\\nstructured survey was conducted in the most representative and/or popular production sites of \\nthe selected province or sub-province. The producers of the selected products in villages were \\ninvited to a round table discussion at the Village Headman House or Village Caf\\u00e9 and the \\nRRA study was carried out by filling in the form during conversations with the group. Each \\nsemi-structured completed questionnaire form in the selected areas (RRA Instrument) is \\nsummarized with the additional information obtained about the location and the products from \\nkey stakeholders during the interview.  \\n \\n5.1. RRA study reports  \\n5.1.1. Afyonkarahisar \\u2013 milk and beef \\nAfyonkarahisar plays a major supply role in beef and veal, meat products and milk (including \\nwater buffalo milk). According to the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture, the number of \\ncattle was 283 979 and of water buffalo was 2 532 in 2007. The 2007 production was 259 676 \\ntons of milk and 20 522 tons of meat (including beef, veal and sheep) and the number of cattle \\nand sheep slaughtered were 88 796 and 17 841 respectively. The total milk production of \\nAfyonkarahisar contributed 2% to the national production. There were 34 milk production \\nplants, of which 24 had applied for milk incentive premiums and were supported for around \\n59 275 tons of milk by the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture in 2007. Approximately 23% \\nof the milk produced was marketed by plants that comply with the minimum required \\ntechnical standards (i.e. hygiene, quality control etc.), the primary requirement to be \\nsupported. \\n \\nThe registered annual production in 2007 equated to 2 366 tons sucuk (Turkish type sausage), \\n832 tons sausage, 369 tons salami, 94 tons pastrami (dried meat), 126 tons kebab, 297 tons \\nkavurma (roasted meat), 27 tons ham, and 2.4 tons burger meat. \\n \\nAs of 24 November 2008, there were 137 308 registered cattle; of which 42 772 were \\nattributed to the pedigree system (including 20 278 cows) and 94 536 to the pre-pedigree \\nsystem (including 60 956 cows and 14 820 bulls). 2 112 farmers (4 cooperatives and 5 private \\ncompanies) were registered to the pedigree system and 24 745 (8 cooperatives and 5 private \\n 48\\ncompanies) to the pre-pedigree system. According to these figures, each farmer had an \\naverage of 20.3 cattle of which 16.6 were cows. \\n \\nThere was no application for organic farming and GAP (good agricultural practices) for \\nanimal breeding. However, organic fruits, flowers and other vegetables were grown on around \\n328 ha by 296 different producers. \\n \\nAfyonkarahisar Chamber of Commerce has three GI certificates for Afyon Sucuk, Afyon \\nPastrami and Afyon Milk Cream. A supervision team has been formed and a hologram has \\nbeen designed for meat products (especially for sucuk). Managers that were contacted have \\nclaimed that the leading firm-brands in the region like Cumhuriyet, \\u0130kbal, \\u0130pek do not \\nvolunteer for use of this hologram as they mostly believe that their brand is much better \\nknown than the GI hologram. Another reason is the lack of traceability of those firms that use \\nthis hologram. However, this may still be an incentive for some SMEs which could not \\nachieve to be a brand. \\n \\nIn the province, an association (ASEMSU) was formed in 2006 to bring together producers in \\nthe area and it currently has 20 members. ASEMSU prepared educational panels to instruct \\nand train for hygiene, ISO-22000 and HACCP.  \\n \\nRRA (Susuz village) \\nSusuz is 15 km from Afyonkarahisar with around 1 000 households and a population of \\n6 000; the majority work for the government and local industries. The major products are \\nwheat, barley and clover for feed, milk and cattle. The producers market the cereals to the \\nflour and feed factories in Afyonkarahisar, milk to local dairy plants (via mobile milk \\ncollectors) and beef cattle to the meat processing plants. An irrigation cooperative is present \\nin the village and, in addition, there are 23 farmers registered in the 'Cattle Breeders' \\nAssociation' (CBA) in Afyonkarahisar. This association does not perform any activity for \\nmarketing milk products but helps producers in terms of veterinary services, artificial \\ninseminations, feed supplements and marketing of breeding cattle. The annual income of an \\naverage household is around 7 000 TL of which 70-80% originates from agriculture.  \\n \\nProducers use the words 'hygiene' or 'healthy products' when defining the term 'food quality'. \\nTheir basic information is obtained from the nationwide milk plant veterinarians. \\n \\nThey do not have organic farming in the village, but are partly aware of it. The farmers are \\nnot informed about Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and GIs and there is also no intention \\nof carrying out organic production or GAP. \\n \\nThe average number of dairy cows in the village is about 10, and 23 farmers have more than \\n10 cows and 100 of them less than 10. Around 70 farmers are specialised in beef cattle with \\nan average of 10 animals and the average land for producing corn and/or clover for feed is \\naround 1 ha. \\n \\nIt has been observed that during the last decade the number of dairy cattle increased. \\nMoreover, farmers without tractors have left agricultural production. There is an improvement \\nin production technologies (artificial insemination, machinery, veterinary services, and \\nefficient milk production) and an increase in production of milk that fulfils the Turkish codex \\nrequirements. However, the intention to increase the quality of production is not significant \\nbecause of the increase in production costs. There is also a decrease in the net profit from \\n 49\\nagricultural products (meat and milk) basically due to input prices that increase more so than \\nthe output prices (milk price versus feed costs and veterinary services). \\n \\nThe advantages of producers are their closeness to the market and cheap manpower whereas \\nthe disadvantages are the lack of water and pasture areas.  \\n \\nFarmers have been investing in barns, machinery for silage and milking; more than 50% \\nalready have milking machines. The basic source of investment capital is from their own \\nsources. \\n \\nRRA (K\\u00fc\\u00e7\\u00fck\\u00e7obanl\\u0131 Village) \\nThe village has 85 households and the population is around 750. The major income sources \\nare animal breeding (water buffalo, dairy cattle and beef cattle) and vegetable production. \\nProducers sell the wheat to flour plants and barley to feed plants. Milk from water buffalo is \\nused for milk cream and the remaining part is used for a special type of filtered yogurt that is \\nmarketed in Afyonkarahisar. The milk is sold to regional collectors and sometimes to \\nnationwide plants. Beef cattle for meat are sold to regional plants. Villagers place their annual \\nincome at around 8 000-10 000 TL per household. The agricultural development cooperative \\nhas 30 members; the irrigation cooperative has 47 members in the village. The majority of \\nfarm households earn all their income (100%) from agricultural activities. Around 15 people \\nwork in Afyonkarahisar and commute on a daily basis. \\n \\nThe major understanding of food quality is hygiene. The special product of the region is milk \\ncream from water buffalo milk as the region is geographically suitable for water buffalo. The \\nproducers' association is looking for alternatives to build a milk cream production plant for \\nthe village and looking for support from the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and \\nuniversity. The price of water buffalo milk is double the price of cow milk and it is generally \\nused for yoghurt or milk cream production. The quality of milk cream cannot be audited and a \\npure product is rarely found (often mixed with cow\\u2019s milk). \\n \\nOrganic agriculture is understood to refer to production without fertilizers and pesticides. \\nFarmers have no information about GAP, and no intention of farming organically. Farmers \\nhave heard about the GI of Afyon Sucuk and Pastrami but are not aware what this means \\nexactly nor of its potential advantages. There are about 80 farmers that own at least 20 beef \\ncattle and the production method is in open pasture and barns. \\n \\nLarge breeding plants in Afyonkarahisar \\nCo\\u015fkun Meat and Products Inc. \\nThe firm has two modern farms in Istanbul and Afyonkarahisar (founded in 2003) with a \\ncapacity for around 5 500 cattle and it currently has around 3 800 animals (600 water buffalo \\nand the rest beef cattle). There are 2 500 water buffalo in the Istanbul farms, 36 workers are \\npresent on the farm with full automation. The barns have concrete floors and are very clean. \\nThey have no own feed production. All feed for animals is packed and stored in separate \\nstores. Entrance is restricted and the firm obtained ISO 22000 (in 2008) and also an ISO 9001 \\ncertificate. \\n \\nPlants producing meat products (\\u0130kbal and Cumhuriyet)  \\n\\u0130kbal Meat Products Industry was founded in 1990. The name comes from a famous city \\nrestaurant founded in 1922. The plant has a slaughtering capacity of 500-600 cattle per month \\naround 30% of this figure are water buffalo. \\n 50\\n \\nThe net meat weight of the slaughtered cattle, water buffalo and dairy cow are around 300, \\n230 and 300 kg respectively. Meat is sold fresh and used for processed meat such as sucuk, \\nsausages, pastrami, salami, ham, kebab, meat burgers and roasted meat. Fresh meat is sold to \\nhotel chains and also to grocery shops that the plant owns in Istanbul. \\u0130kbal has a franchising \\nsystem, with around 27 restaurants and basically selling cooked meals, kebabs and a famous \\nAfyon kaymakl\\u0131 kaday\\u0131f (a kind of dessert made from stale bread, sugar syrup and served \\nwith milk cream from the region). The firm has ISO 9001, HACCP (since 2004) and \\nISO 22000 (since 2007). \\u0130kbal mainly considers the age, weight, registration (of the animal) \\nand appearance of the cattle before purchasing and slaughtering. The firm employs \\nveterinarians and food engineers, and live animal suppliers are evenly shared between large \\nfirms and small farmers. The firm does not sell bulk meat and has a plan to construct a plant \\nwith a capacity of around 1 500 tons of meat/month. Nationwide marketing chains sell the \\nfirm's products. \\n \\nCumhuriyet Meat Products Industry was founded in 1928 as a small producer and opened the \\ncurrent modern plant in 2005. On average 200 cattle are processed per day but the capacity is \\naround 500. The processed meat products are sucuk, pastrami and fresh meat. The firm has \\nvendors in many cities and it owns a big restaurant near a major highway and in \\nAfyonkarahisar. Meat products are sold in all major marketing chains nationwide such as \\nMigros, Tan\\u015fa\\u015f, Kiler, Real and Metro, and fresh meat is also sold to traders in Istanbul. The \\nfirm does not have HACCP and ISO 22000 but has applied for certification. Marketing chains \\nlike Migros and Real audit the firm on a periodic basis and the firm is trusted for its brand \\nname. \\n \\n5.1.2. Bal\\u0131kesir (Ayval\\u0131k) \\u2013 olives and olive oil \\nAyval\\u0131k is located south of Edremit Bay in the Balikesir province of the Aegean region. The \\nmain source of income is domestic tourism and olives/olive oils. There are approximately \\n4 800 olive producers with 1 800 000 olive trees on 16 000 ha. Only around 1% of the \\nproducers have more than 1 000 olive trees. Olives can be picked intensively in two years; the \\nyields of two successive years are approximately 50-60 kg/tree and 12 kg/tree, respectively. \\nAbout 95% of the olives are used for oil and the rest is for direct consumption. On average, \\nthe oil yield is 1 kg of oil from 7 kg olives but sometimes it could increase to 1 kg of oil from \\n5 kg olives as occurred in 2008. \\n \\nThe main problems are olive moth and olive fly. Until the ban in 2006, TKB used pesticides \\nsprayed from the air for the olive fly on all trees in the region. To protect olives from the \\nmoth, producers use pesticides during the development of the fruit. Another problem of the \\nregion is sloped terrain (more than 80%) which results in short and small olive trees and \\nreduces the possibility of irrigation. However, trees on flat land, from which the olives are \\nused as table olives, are irrigated by a drip system. \\n \\nAyval\\u0131k Chamber of Commerce (CoC) obtained the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) \\ncertification for olive oil in the Ayval\\u0131k region in 2007 following a costly four year procedure. \\nIn addition, TAR\\u0130\\u015e also holds a PDO certificate, covering an area from \\u00c7anakkale to \\u0130zmir \\nincluding Ayval\\u0131k. In the Ayval\\u0131k region, the CoC has been actively promoting the use of the \\nPDO. Firms have to apply to the CoC for the use of PDO holograms and products should pass \\nannual chemical and sensory analyses carried out by eight experts. To qualify, experts must \\n 51\\nbe trained by the 'Olive Friends Association'. In 2008, 15 different plants applied for the use \\nof PDO holograms and 14 of them were approved. \\n \\nAlthough there are transaction costs for obtaining the PDO certificate and producing in \\naccordance with the norms, firms cannot sell their products at a premium price. Therefore, the \\nuse of PDO holograms is only to gain consumer confidence and strengthen the brand's name. \\nThe CoC also organises a harvesting fair each year, where tasting panels and other activities \\nare carried out to advertise the Ayval\\u0131k olive oil brand and support the olive oil market. \\n \\nRRA (Ak\\u00e7ap\\u0131nar village) \\nAk\\u00e7ap\\u0131nar is a mountain village in the Ayval\\u0131k district with 500 households and a population \\nof 1 200. The main source of income is olives for olive oil production, with a few trees \\nplanted recently for table olive production. In addition, goats are raised for own consumption \\nand okra is also cultivated as a cash crop. Olives are sold to the cooperative\\u2019s plant (TAR\\u0130\\u015e) \\nor nearby merchants or olive oil plants. TAR\\u0130\\u015e belongs to an agricultural marketing \\ncooperative in the village with 100 members, with activities on olive marketing and providing \\nan advance payment in the form of a credit of around 3 000 TL per ton, based on the average \\nquantity of the olive oil delivered to TAR\\u0130\\u015e in the last 3 years. The annual income of a \\nhousehold exclusively from agricultural activity is around 6 000 TL. Farmers also work as \\nlabourers in the olive gardens of the olive oil factories and merchants. In employment women \\nnormally earn 50% less than men. \\n \\nThe acid content of the olive oil is described as the food quality in olive oil by the producers. \\nThe difference of this region's olive oil is claimed to be due to climate and soil composition. \\nTherefore, olives grown in the Ayval\\u0131k region yield more mature olives and give more oil. \\nFarmers have no idea how to distinguish their products from others, and claim that olives and \\nolive oil have been transferred to Ayval\\u0131k from other regions (like Ayd\\u0131n), processed in \\nAyval\\u0131k and marketed as Ayval\\u0131k olive oil. Ayvalik farmers also claim that their product is \\nsuperior in terms of acidity, taste, shelf-life and colour among its competitors. \\n \\nProduction without using chemical fertilizers is described as organic farming; farmers have no \\nknowledge about GAP and have not heard of geographical indications. There is no organic \\nfarming or GAP applied in the region. \\n \\nThere are around 450 producers with on average 1 ha each; only 10 have more than 5 ha and \\n45 less than 1 ha of land. Intermediate-dwarf trees are used for common production. \\n \\nProducers claim that the average land owned by producers has been increasing during the last \\ndecade. Some farmers have invested in drip irrigation systems, use new pesticide management \\nsystems and plant different kinds of olive trees. In recent years, new pruning methods, \\nexpansion of irrigation and efficient use of pesticides caused an improvement in the olive oil \\nquality. Profits from olive production have declined due to inflation, an increase in input \\ncosts, a decrease in selling prices and droughts. With regards to input costs, the price of \\npesticides and fertilizers in particular has increased and therefore the application has been \\nreduced. Another important increase in input cost is due to rising diesel prices.  \\n \\nAdvantages of Ayval\\u0131k olive oil production are: proximity to the seaside (climate), soil (with \\nclay), workforce and experience, whereas disadvantages include lack of irrigation facilities, \\norganisational weaknesses, sloped land and small farm size. \\n \\n 52\\nProducers invested in forming new olive orchards (at a cost of 250 TL/ha) and purchasing \\nautomatic machines for pesticides (15 000 TL/ha), where 50% of the machine is given as aid \\nby TKB to the farmers. \\n \\n5.1.3. Antalya (Kumluca) \\u2013 tomatoes \\nKumluca in the Antalya province is the leader in greenhouse production of tomatoes in \\nTurkey. Tomatoes are produced in 24 villages and 3 small towns belonging to Kumluca on \\n3 700 ha in greenhouses (plastic and glass covered). Around 7 500 farmers deal with \\ngreenhouse production. The overall population of Kumluca is of 70 000, of which 12 500 are \\nfarmers. In addition, green peppers and eggplants are also produced in greenhouses in the \\nregion. In Antalya province 1.7 million tons of tomatoes are produced and Kumluca \\ncontributes 600 000 tons, around 40% of the total for export. This has also supported the \\ndevelopment of related industries in the region, such as 104 pesticide suppliers, 13 seedling \\nproduction plants and 3 different wholesale markets, which are very busy in export seasons. \\n \\nGreenhouse production began in the 1980s and it has expanded to cover almost the entire \\nKumluca Valley. The region outside the Kumluca Valley does not produce tomatoes, \\ntherefore other vegetables like eggplants, peppers and fruits (citrus and pomegranate) are \\nproduced in these areas. \\n \\nThe main factor affecting production is the considerable age of the greenhouses, which \\nincreases the risk of viruses and thus requires the use of more pesticides. On the other hand, \\nthe experience (know-how) gained over 30 years and the well-developed marketing structure \\nare the main advantages. \\n \\nRRA (Sar\\u0131casu village) \\nThe village has 1 000 households and 3 500 people and is linked to the central town of the \\nKumluca region. The main source of income is greenhouse production (the majority being \\ntomatoes, followed by eggplants and peppers) and 60% of fresh tomatoes are exported. There \\nis no active producers\\u2019 cooperative or organisation. The producers\\u2019 association and chamber \\nof agriculture are present in the district centre but not very active in nearby villages. The \\naverage annual income of a household is around 10 000 TL, almost entirely from agriculture. \\nIn addition, a few people work in packaging plants in the export season or have small village \\ngroceries. \\n \\nHygiene and products without pesticide residues are the main aspects understood in terms of \\nfood quality. Products of this region (especially tomatoes) are believed to be different from \\nother regions due to the climate. Using the \\u2018region name\\u2019 on the packaging material is \\nbelieved to differentiate from other products. Moreover, tomatoes from nearby regions like \\nSerik and Demre are claimed to be marketed as Kumluca tomatoes. Tomatoes produced in \\nKumluca are distinct in size, smell and taste. \\n \\nFarmers perceive organic farming as pesticide-free production and some confuse it with \\nagriculture without soil. Farmers have no information about GAP or GIs, although nearby \\nFinike Oranges are known to them as GIs. There is no interest in organic farming or in GAP \\nin the region but some large producers are farming without soil (hydroponic). They have \\naccepted systems and technologies but the costs are too high for them to cover. The average \\nsize of greenhouse production is about 0.4 ha. \\n \\n 53\\nProducers reported that the average greenhouse size has been increasing recently due to large \\nproducers entering the market. Some small producers have left the sector as a result of \\ndifficulties with repayments to bank creditors and other agents. Production technologies used \\nhave been improved, for example building high tunnel greenhouses, high air ventilation \\nsystems, using seedlings and Bambus bee nets. In addition, the use of vaccinated seeds \\n(resistance to diseases) and greenhouses with high air ventilation systems (reducing the need \\nfor pesticides) also increase product quality. Net profit is lowering due to inflation and high \\ninput costs and the constant sale price of the final product. \\n \\nThe advantages are the climate, soil composition and experience whereas the disadvantages \\nare disease and low resistance of the soil to diseases.   \\n \\nProducers have invested in greenhouse renewal (air ventilation systems, ventilation, drip \\nirrigation systems, using seedling and grafted seeding etc). Investment costs for a new \\ngreenhouse is around 150 000-200 000 TL/ha. The capital investment is generally financed \\nwith bank credits. The capital for seedling and other inputs are supplied by the Agricultural \\nCredit Cooperatives. If they need fixed term payments they may choose pesticide dealers and \\nfor cash advances they can obtain the money from agents in the wholesale market. \\n \\n5.1.4. Isparta (E\\u011firdir) \\u2013 apples \\nThe annual apple production of Turkey is around 2.5 million tons from a total of 34.5 million \\ntrees and Isparta has a share of around 12.5% in terms of apple trees and 20% in terms of \\napple production. In the E\\u011firdir district (sub-province), the cold-storage capacity is around \\n130 000 tons/year and most of them do not have controlled-atmosphere storage facilities. \\nHowever, there is a constant increase in the number of cold-storage houses with controlled-\\natmosphere and sorting/packaging units. As an example, in E\\u011firdir, the Agricultural \\nDevelopment Cooperatives have such cold-storage houses with a capacity of almost 50 000 \\ntons/year. \\n \\nThe districts growing apples are E\\u011firdir, Gelendost and Senirkent. E\\u011firdir produces 50% \\nmore than the others. The main varieties are Starking and Golden (around 85-90% of the \\norchards). There are no attempts at organic production or GIs but in some villages there are \\nGlobalGAP applications.  \\n \\nThe average age of apple orchards in E\\u011firdir is more than 35 years, meaning they are towards \\nthe end of their economic life cycle. The average size of farms is 1-1.5 ha. New organisations, \\nlike Agricultural Developing Cooperatives, have been emerging in the region and started to \\nplay an important role in marketing. The formation of cooperatives is concentrated in villages \\nbetween the two lakes, E\\u011firdir and Kovada, (namely Serpil, Tepeli, Akdogan, Yukar\\u0131 \\nG\\u00f6kdere, A\\u011f\\u0131lk\\u00f6y, Ey\\u00fcpler, Yuval\\u0131 and Balk\\u0131r\\u0131) which specialise in producing apples. In each \\nof the 8 villages there is a cooperative, with in total 1 417 members. There are cold-storage \\nhouses in each village with a total capacity of 38 000 tons and 5 villages also have \\nsorting/packaging units. In addition, some cooperatives have invested in common drip \\nirrigation systems for their apple orchards and are investigating technological opportunities \\nfor quality improvements. Cooperatives are working with wholesale agents and those with \\nsorting and packaging facilities directly serve nationwide marketing chains like CarrefourSA, \\nReal, Diasa and Tesco-Kipa. \\n \\n \\n 54\\nRRA (Ey\\u00fcpler village) \\nEy\\u00fcpler village in E\\u011firdir consists of 85 households and 310 people, with a high percentage of \\nincomes derived from apple growing (90%). Some farm households also have cherry and \\npeach trees and very few breed goats. Apple varieties are generally Starking (60%) and \\nGolden (40%). Products unsuitable for storage are sold to the close by fruit juice plants. The \\nremaining part is stored and served to local markets. The Agricultural Development \\nCooperative in the village has 39 members and has a 5 000 ton capacity of cold-storage \\nrooms. The marketing of stored apples is usually carried out by the cooperative. The average \\nannual household income is around 12 000 TL, all earned from agricultural activities, \\nparticularly apple growing. Some young inhabitants also work in fruit juice plants during the \\nseasonal harvesting periods. \\n \\nProducers understand hygiene and product standards as food quality. Apples are the special \\nproduct of the region where the basic characteristics are due to the microclimate in the valley \\nbetween two lakes and two mountain ridges. Apple cultivation started during the 1960s in the \\nregion and it is now one of the leading areas. Producers have not made attempts to distinguish \\nany characteristic features of their products due to bulk marketing. Besides, they claim that \\napples from other parts of Turkey (e.g. Mara\\u015f apples) are brought to this region to be \\nmarketed as E\\u011firdir apples. Producers have also reported that apples produced in Ey\\u00fcpler are \\nsuperior in terms of taste, acidity and appearance (shiny, oblong). \\n \\nOrganic farming is perceived by farmers as growing apples without using chemicals and \\nfertilizers. Experience with GlobalGAP (formerly EurepGAP) started two years ago with \\ngovernorship support but ended as no price premium was obtained. Producers are not aware \\nof GIs and claimed that GlobalGAP (or GAP applications) can be retried in the village if it is \\nprofitable. They are also attempting to establish traceability systems for their products by \\nusing software with the support of the District Directorate of Agriculture in E\\u011firdir. Producers \\nbelieve that these kinds of systems can result in a decrease in production costs. \\n \\nThere are 130 producers with an average of 1.5 ha farm area in Ey\\u00fcpler. Among these, 10 \\nhave more than 5 ha, 30 between 2 ha and 5 ha and 15 with less than 1 ha. Drip irrigation \\nsystems are common in all orchards and trees are generally half-dwarf conventional varieties. \\n \\nDuring the last decade, the scale of apple farms has not changed much. Recent developments \\ninclude establishing new cold-storage rooms, drip irrigation systems and using tractors in \\nfarming. In addition, some production techniques, like fruit thinning methods, are also \\nexperimented with to increase the product quality. Producers' organisations in the form of \\ncooperatives have increased in importance. Net profits are lowered mainly due to inflation \\nand input costs (fertilizers and others).  \\n \\nThe advantages in apple production are climate, water and closeness to processing plants and \\ndisadvantages are humidity, frequent precipitation and soil composition. \\n \\nFarmers have been supported in investments in establishing irrigation systems (4 500 TL/ha- \\n45% subsidy), replanting apple orchards (20 000 TL/ha-50% subsidy), constructing cold \\nstorage rooms (bank credits) and fencing for wild animals (50% governor subsidy). \\n \\n 55\\n5.1.5. Manisa (Ala\\u015fehir) \\u2013 grapes and raisins \\nAla\\u015fehir is a district in the province of Manisa and is one of the main areas where seedless \\ngrapes are grown. According to the information gathered from Ala\\u015fehir Directorate of \\nAgriculture, there are 19 500 ha of vineyards in the areas giving a total of 2 250 000 tons of \\nfresh grapes. Around 316 000 tons of raisins are produced from some of these fresh grapes \\nand 250 000 tons of the raisins are exported. The conversion rate is 1 ton of raisins obtained \\nfrom 4.5-5 tons of fresh grapes. Around 65-70% of the grapes are used for the raisin \\nproduction and the rest is marketed as fresh and also used in wine or alcohol production.  \\n \\nThe main source of income in 30 of the 65 villages located in the district is grape production. \\nA total of 5 000 producers farm on vineyards of an average of around 1 ha. The yield is \\naround 30 tons/ha. In a well designed vineyard it has been reported that yields can be \\nincreased to around 100 tons/ha by using modern techniques like high trellis systems and by \\ndrip irrigation systems (however only about 15% of the total production area uses this type of \\nirrigation). \\n \\nThere are around 50 packaging and processing plants for exports. Firms focusing on fresh \\ngrape exports have been building plants in this region since 2000 and they also use their \\npackaging units for other products, like strawberries, cherries etc., produced in this region.  \\n \\nAccording to the interview with TAR\\u0130\\u015e officials in the district, the main quality problem in \\ngrape production is pesticide residues. A pesticide laboratory with nine workers has been set \\nup with the support of Ala\\u015fehir Mercantile Exchange and Intertek (an international firm). The \\naflatoxin problem is not a common problem unless it rains heavily during the growing season. \\nFarmers are trained by agricultural engineers to overcome the problem. Moreover, farmers are \\ncurious about the effects of cyanide used in gold mine processes on the quality of grapes. \\n \\nRecently, there has been no governmental support to grape production. However, during the \\n1970s the construction of concrete platforms for raisin drying was supported, and some of \\nthem are still in use. Nowadays, new multi-storey fenced drying systems increase the raisin \\nquality but their construction is not supported. The interest in grape production is increasing \\nin neighbouring Buldan (Denizli). \\n \\nThe storage of raisins can be extended to two years in a controlled atmosphere provided that \\nthe pre-drying is done correctly. The largest storage house belongs to the TAR\\u0130\\u015e cooperative \\nwhere members\\u2019 average vineyard size is around 1.6 ha, higher than the region\\u2019s average. A \\nfamily with four members should have a plot of at least 2 ha live sustainably from grape \\nproduction, therefore it is expected that some small producers may leave production in the \\nnear future.  \\n \\nThere is no organic production in this region but 20% of the producers comply with \\nGlobalGAP with the support of export firms based on contract farming. \\n \\nRRA (Ba\\u011fl\\u0131ca village) \\nBa\\u011fl\\u0131ca village has around 550 households with 1 600 people where all residents\\u2019 main source \\nof income comes from vineyards. Almost 40% of the grapes produced are sent to wineries. \\nThe remainder is seedless white grapes and 85% are marketed as fresh and 10-15% as raisins. \\nThe commercial products of the village are grapes and cattle breeding (performed with the \\nhelp of agricultural development support in 70 farm households). There are Agricultural \\nCredit and Agricultural Development Cooperatives in the village with 400 and 70 members \\n 56\\nrespectively. These cooperatives are not active in the marketing of grapes. The average \\nhousehold income per village resident is 7 000 TL/year, all of which is agricultural income.  \\n \\nProducers understand hygiene and product shape as food quality. The special product of the \\nregion is the seedless white grape. The special differences to other regions are the soil \\ncomposition and low boron content of the water used for irrigation. Farmers also indicated \\nthat a strong producer's association and using the brand name of the association may be \\nbeneficial in terms of differentiating themselves from other regions. Nearby regions sell \\nproducts with reference to the same origin. However, products of the Ala\\u015fehir district are \\nsuperior in terms of taste, appearance (larger) and shelf-life, and can therefore be marketed at \\nabout 50% higher than their rivals. \\n \\nProducers cannot define organic production and have no information about GAP; they have \\nonly heard that large producers apply it. They also have no information or even idea about \\nGIs. There is no land in the region suitable for organic production. Contract farming with \\nlarge customers requires specific production techniques (as for example GAP). Overall all \\nthese systems are seen as opportunities and believed to increase the market share and sale \\nprice. \\n \\nThere are around 400 producers with an average vineyard size of 3 ha. Among these 5-6 \\nproducers have more than 10 ha and 100 have less than 1 ha. The common method of \\nvineyard plantation is building high trellis systems.  \\n \\nThe average size of the vineyards has been decreasing during the last decade and producers \\nhave tended to switch to high trellis systems, drop irrigation and new varieties in recent years. \\nIn addition, covers are increasingly used to prevent rain damage and pesticides are used with \\nthe utmost care to increase quality. TAR\\u0130\\u015e requires a minimum amount of grapes to be \\nhandled in order to grant membership, which reduces the opportunity for coordination among \\nsmaller producers. There is also an increase in the number of merchants and export firms in \\nthe region. There is a loss in net profit due to inflation and increased input costs. \\n \\nThe advantages are climate, soil, groundwater availability and workforce experience, while \\ndisadvantages are lack of coordination and the presence of a gold mine (cyanide use).  \\n \\nRecent investments are installing a high trellis system (50 000 TL/ha) and drip irrigation \\nsystems (5 000 TL/ha) and are mainly financed from personal capital. \\n \\n5.1.6. Ayd\\u0131n \\u2013 figs \\nThe economy of the province of Ayd\\u0131n depends on agriculture and industry. According to the \\ndata and information from Ayd\\u0131n Provincial Directorate of Agriculture, the main agricultural \\nproducts of Ayd\\u0131n are figs, olives (gemlik olives), chestnuts, strawberries, cotton, corn, feed \\ngrass and animal breeding. Though figs are produced almost all over the province the special \\nfigs for sun-drying (yellow-lobe) are produced in the Germencik and Incirliova districts. \\nThere are around 6.5 million fig trees on 39 678.2 ha with 30-40 thousand producers. The \\noverall dried fig production of Turkey is around 45-50 thousand tons, of which around 70% \\nare produced in Ayd\\u0131n. The drying yield is around 1 kg dried figs from 5 kg fresh figs, and \\npre-drying figs are placed on a wire-shelf above the ground where they are left under direct \\nsunlight (called kerevit). Water content is reduced to around 30% during sun-drying and \\nthereafter in processing plants it is further reduced to 20% for final use. Around 95% of dried \\n 57\\nfigs are exported and the rest is sold on the domestic market. Figs are harvested between mid-\\nAugust and mid-September. Processing plants, including 120 large ones, elaborate the \\nproduce (dried figs) until December of the same year.  \\n \\nThe main quality problem in dried figs is aflatoxin due to contamination with soil fungus \\nduring open air drying. Aflatoxin content is periodically checked in exported products but not \\nfor those destined for the domestic market. The Exporters' Association only compensates \\nadditional costs for products containing aflatoxin following pre-checking. According to data \\nin 2008, around 1% of the products are expected to contain aflatoxin. Fig trees are mainly \\ngrown on mountain slopes and no pesticides, or fertilizers are applied, only animal manure. \\nThere is no irrigation system on the slopes; therefore the quality of figs depends on the \\namount of rain. Figs do not grow well enough if the average annual amount of rain is below \\n630 l/m2. Even though the above mentioned method of fig production is very close to organic \\nproduction there are currently no producers licensed for organic production. There is no \\nspecific governmental support for the production or exportation of figs. \\n \\nAyd\\u0131n Chamber of Commerce has the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) for yellow-lobe \\n(Sar\\u0131lop) figs from Ayd\\u0131n; however, its common use has not started yet. TAR\\u0130\\u015e Fig \\nAssociation has planned to use the holograms on its 2008 produce packages. Officials dealing \\nwith the PDO procedures have indicated that the main purpose of obtaining PDO for yellow-\\nlobe (Sar\\u0131lop) figs from Ayd\\u0131n is to prevent unfair competition and to increase profits. The \\nmain characteristics of Ayd\\u0131n figs are their thin skin, sweetness, light colour and shape. Izmir \\nMercantile Exchange has also obtained a PDO for dried figs covering the entire Aegean \\nregion (also including Ayd\\u0131n); however, the PDO is until now not utilised. \\n \\nTAR\\u0130\\u015e fig unions have around 5 000 members in 15 cooperatives. It organises training \\ncourses for its members on tree maintenance, production, harvesting, pruning etc. There are \\napproximately 400 workers operating in the processing plant of TAR\\u0130\\u015e in Germencik and \\nthey processed 4 000 tons of dried figs in 2007, 70% of them were exported and the rest was \\nsold on the domestic market. \\n \\nRRA (\\u00c7ar\\u0131klar village) \\n\\u00c7ar\\u0131klar village is a mountain village in the Germencik district. The village is located on a \\nmountain chain, between Ayd\\u0131n and Izmir, with 165 households and a population of 482. The \\nmain source of income is agriculture and the main products are figs (70%) and olives (30%). \\nFigs are the yellow lobe (sar\\u0131lop) type suitable for drying and olives are generally used for \\nolive oil production. Each household also has 1 or 2 cows for their personal milk and cheese \\nconsumption. Producers sell figs and olives, preferably to TAR\\u0130\\u015e or to merchants (lower price \\nbut cash payments). There are two different cooperatives, one for figs (120 members) and one \\nfor olives (80 members) in the village and they play an active role in the marketing of the \\nproducts. The cooperatives give an advance of 1.5 TL/kg for figs and 2 TL/kg for olives to \\ntheir members as corresponding to the producers\\u2019 previous year delivery. The average annual \\nhousehold income is around 4 000 TL, mostly from agricultural production. \\n \\nProducers understand food quality to be natural and special produce, and the regional \\nspeciality are dried figs. Villagers claim their figs are special due to the geographical and \\nclimatic characteristics (mountain slopes and wind). Producers could not indicate how to \\nshow the difference of their products from others. They have claimed that other figs around \\nthe region -from other valleys in Ayd\\u0131n and Izmir provinces- are also marketed as Ayd\\u0131n figs. \\n 58\\nIn addition, the dried figs of this region (located on the mountain chains) differ from others \\ndue to their skin thickness, taste and appearance (whiteness). \\n \\nOrganic farming is described by local producers as agriculture without fertilizers and \\npesticides; they have no opinion on GAP or GI. It has also been reported that chemical \\nfertilizers are not used every year. \\n \\nAll producers, dealing with fig (1.6 ha) and olive (0.9 ha) production, work on steep land \\nwithout irrigation. \\n  \\nProducers also indicated that, despite the fact that the size of the processing plants did not \\nchange in the last decade, the number of fig trees has decreased due to droughts. They are \\nwell-organised in agricultural marketing cooperatives and new pruning and drying (kerevit \\nusage) methods have recently become more widely applied. They also reported that net profits \\nhave decreased in recent years, mainly due to the rise in input costs compared to the output \\nprice, but also due to droughts. \\n \\nAdvantages are recorded as climate, soil and workforce. Disadvantages are defined as joint \\ntitle deeds, no opportunity for irrigation, a fungus disease which desiccates fig trees and the \\nlack of a suitable credit opportunity for replanting. Producers have themselves invested in \\nplanting trees in recent years, mainly from their own savings. \\n \\n5.1.7. Malatya \\u2013 apricots \\nApricots are grown all over Turkey except in east Anatolia where severe winter conditions \\noccur and in the east Black Sea region because of high humidity. The Malatya region supplies \\naround 60% of Turkey\\u2019s overall apricot production and 7-10% of the world\\u2019s apricot \\nproduction. Almost all apricots obtained from Malatya are dried and 90% are exported. \\nTurkey has a share of around 80-85% in the world dried apricot market. The common \\nimportant variety is Hac\\u0131halilo\\u011flu and 70% of the trees are of this variety. Hac\\u0131halilo\\u011flu is the \\nmost important variety used in drying. Other varieties like Kabaa\\u015f\\u0131, So\\u011fanc\\u0131, \\u00c7atalo\\u011flu and \\n\\u00c7\\u00f6lo\\u011flu are also planted. The total plantation area is around 72 000 ha and the estimated \\nnumber of trees is 7 million. Organic farming is applied on 24 000 ha. \\n \\nThe annual production is around 600 000 tons. The export revenue in recent years reached up \\nto 150 million USD where the annual amount exported is around 70 000-100 000 tons. \\nAround 50 000 households work in apricot cultivation in the Malatya region. As a result of an \\napplication made by Malatya Chamber of Commerce in July 2000, accredited in January \\n2001, the Malatya apricot obtained the status of PDO. The scope of this PDO includes \\nMalatya province and Baskil district (Elaz\\u0131\\u011f province), G\\u00fcr\\u00fcn district (Sivas province), \\nG\\u00f6lba\\u015f\\u0131 district (Ad\\u0131yaman province) and Elbistan district (Kahramanmara\\u015f province). The \\nmain characteristic of Malatya apricots is the high dry matter content, of 23-25%, compared \\nto around 15% for apricots grown elsewhere in Turkey and the world according to the Fruit \\nResearch Institute. Therefore this type of apricot is very suitable for drying and preserving \\nand impedes the mixing with other dried apricots. \\n \\nThe Provincial Directorate of Agriculture, the Fruit Research Institute, the Apricot Research \\nDevelopment and Presentation Foundation, the Apricot Cooperative, Malatya Chamber of \\nCommerce, South Eastern Anatolia Exporters Association, the Apricot Producers Association \\n 59\\nand Governorship of Malatya all deal with coordination of apricot production and marketing \\nin the Malatya province.  \\n \\nThe Provincial Directorate of Agriculture indicates climate as the main factor affecting the \\nyield and also the amount of sulphide to be used. Late spring freezes can negatively affect the \\nquality. Colour changes during the drying period and using sulphide prevents the enzymatic \\nactivity responsible for darkening. It also prevents moulds, yeast, microbial and other insects \\ndue to its antimicrobial nature. The EU accepts a sulphide content of 2 000 parts per million \\n(ppm) and the USA 3 000 ppm. Producers claim that they cannot use less sulphide than the \\ntraditional basis-level. On the other hand, packaging and processing plants claim that \\nproducers overuse sulphide, in consequence they cannot meet a homogeneous level in \\nprocessing and extra costs are incurred to meet the standards set by importing countries.  \\n \\nFirms dealing with exports claim that no problem exists in terms of quality in exports and \\nthey have certification according to HACCP, ISO 9000 and ISO 22000. Actually, no exported \\ndried apricots have been refused. The quality factors monitored in dried apricots are the \\namounts of sulphide-oxide, humidity, pesticide residue, time of harvest, and packaging \\nmaterials used. According to standards set by the Turkish Standards Institution (TSE), dried \\napricots are grouped according to how they are marketed, typed by preparation method, sorted \\nbased on appearance quality, and size class determined by the number of dried apricots per 1 \\nkg. The groups are either natural or with added sulphide; types are with or without kernel and \\ndivided vertically (3 types), sorting is as Extra, Class I, II and Industrial and sizing is on a \\nscale ranging from 1 to 8. In scale 1 there are up to 80 dried apricots in 1 kg and in scale 8 \\nmore than 200. \\n \\nDried apricots are generally exported in packs of 12 or 25 kg and re-packaged in the receiving \\ncountry or used industrially. TSE standards mandate the upper limits of packages as 25 kg in \\nthe domestic market and 100 kg for industrial use. The amount exported in 2007 was 102 000 \\ntons (see Table 16).  \\n \\nTable 16: Dried apricot exports of Turkey   \\nYear Amount (tons) Value (million US $) \\n2000 73 000 112 \\n2001 99 000 89 \\n2002 70 000 122 \\n2003 73 000 152 \\n2004 80 000 199 \\n2005 95 000 179 \\n2006 111 000 194 \\n2007 102 000 236 \\nSource: South-Eastern Anatolia Exporters Association \\n \\nNo firms develop new products based on apricots, as dried apricots from Turkey have a good \\nreputation on the world market. On the other hand, additional promotional activities would \\nincrease apricot consumption worldwide. Although exporting firms complain about the costs \\nthat would be incurred and the lack of capital to support such promotion, some of the larger \\nfirms participate in international fairs with government supports. The main destinations of \\nexports are the USA (more than 60 %), the Russian Federation, the UK and France. The main \\nquality problems are that workers do not take enough care during harvest, drying and storage, \\nand that producers apply varied amounts of sulphide, and that storage facilities near farms are \\nnot suitable. Producers do not take responsibility but claim that they cannot invest in building \\na new storage room.  \\n 60\\n \\nAccording to the Malatya Provincial Directorate of Agriculture, although organic farming \\nincreased in recent years producers do not exactly know (more than 80%) what constitutes \\norganic farming. Those who have the certificate claim that they could not sell their product \\nwith a premium and suggest that quality is mainly due to climate, humidity and not having \\ndroughts. The Provincial Directorate of Agriculture maintains that they have started training \\nprogrammes for GAP and will have results within 3 to 5 years. It has also formed teams for \\nfertilizing and pesticide application according to the meteorological conditions. They are \\ntaking samples to the Diyarbakir Agricultural Research Institute and share the results with the \\nfarmers. \\n \\nRRA (\\u00c7\\u0131\\u011fl\\u0131k village) \\nThe RRA was conducted in the \\u00c7\\u0131\\u011fl\\u0131k village of the Do\\u011fan\\u015fehir district in Malatya province. \\nThere are 180 households and the main source of income is agriculture. The main agricultural \\nactivities are apricot production followed by apple, pear and cherry production, and field \\ncrops are wheat and beans (see table 17). In each household there are 2-3 cows for \\nsubsistence. Agricultural products are marketed through merchants, and marketing \\ncooperatives are not present in the village. However, some farmers are members of the \\nMalatya Apricot Producers' Association (not very active in the marketing of apricots) and also \\nof the Agricultural Credit Cooperative. \\n \\nTable 17: What are the production methods of the products in your village? Could you rank them? \\nProducts \\n(in order of significances) Estimated area planted Number of producers Production method \\nApricots 200 ha 132 Conventional \\nApricots 30 ha 10 Organic \\nApples 80 ha 65 Conventional  \\nWheat 110 ha 110 Conventional \\n \\nThe average annual income is around 5 000-6 000 TL/household, almost 90% from \\nagriculture. Additional incomes are pensions and some people work for the government and \\nprivate sectors in nearby Do\\u011fan\\u015fehir. \\n \\nThe apricot producers consider the attractiveness and product standards as food quality. Dried \\napricots and mulberry products (like mulberry molasses and dried mulberry pulp) are the \\nspecial products of the region. \\n \\nVillagers explain that their soil is different in terms of climate and composition and, therefore, \\napricots produced in the region are of a higher quality and more suitable for drying. Local \\napricots have more syrup and are bigger in size with no marketing problems. Thus, producers \\nsee no need to change their production methods. They do not have a brand name but their \\napricots are recognised all over Turkey as Malatya apricots. Other apricots cannot be \\nconfused with Malatya apricots as they are not suitable for drying.  \\n \\nThere are farmers with organic production certificates in the village on an average land size of \\n5 to 6 ha and engineers from the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture educated them on the \\nprocedure. Organic farming is described by farmers as using very small, controlled amounts \\nof pesticides and they have no knowledge of GAP or GIs. There is an interest in organic \\nfarming because of the price level. No products are marketed as PDO as although Malatya \\napricots officially hold this status producers are not aware of it.  \\n \\n 61\\nIn recent years new orchards have been established in \\u00c7\\u0131\\u011fl\\u0131k due to the increasing availability \\nof water. The production method remained the same in recent years but some producers \\nchanged the varieties of apricot. There are no changes in processing or in organisation of \\nfarmers. The main marketing channel is traders of big firms. The net income has been \\ndecreasing due to increases in labour costs and chemicals whereas the price of apricots has \\nbeen almost constant during the last 5 years.  \\n \\nThe advantages are climate and soil composition, as well as very experienced producers, \\nwhereas the disadvantage is the insufficient capacity of warehouses for drying and storage. \\nThe main investment in the village is made in irrigation systems and pressurized water is \\nheavily used by farmers. Some farmers also invest in new plantations. These are mainly \\ncovered by own capital because it is hard to fulfil bank credit requirements. \\n \\n5.1.8. Antalya (Finike) \\u2013 citrus \\nThe Finike region of Antalya province is an important and renowned orange production area \\nin Turkey. One third of the land suitable for cultivation (around 4 000 ha) is used for fruit \\ncultivation (thereof 3 500 ha for citrus). In the Finike region the orange varieties are \\nWashington, Valencia, Yafa and a native one used for orange juice. There are about 800 000 \\norange trees on 2 900 ha. The Washington variety is grown by around 5 000 farmers and \\nobtained the certification PDO Finike orange in November 2008. The application was made in \\n2006 by the producers' association, which has almost 250 members. The total cost of the PDO \\nprocess was around 20 000 TL. The registered amount of annual production of Finike oranges \\nis around 105 000 tons and the total production amounts to 150 000 tons including \\nunregistered production. Finike oranges are special due to their taste, the uniqueness of their \\naroma, their thin outer and inner skin and rapid ripening (which enables earlier harvest). \\n \\nFarmers' major problems are insects like the Akdeniz fruit fly and mealy-bug during rapid \\nripening in fall. Farmers have also indicated that a lack of knowledge in using fertilizers and \\nin taking care of the trees favours insects. A pesticide residue problem is almost non-existant. \\nIn addition, the gravelled terrain of the valley (in Turun\\u00e7ova where the main production is \\nmade) decreases the yield. The sprinkler irrigation system in one third of the area contributes \\nto the different character of Finike oranges compared to the same cultivars grown elsewhere. \\nThe main marketing problem is that produce from other regions is marketed under the name \\nFinike orange. The selling price of Finike oranges is above the average price in the domestic \\nmarket due to early ripening and harvesting time.  \\n \\nRRA (\\u00c7avd\\u0131r-Turun\\u00e7ova) \\n\\u00c7avd\\u0131r in the Turun\\u00e7ova village has 500 households and 1 800 inhabitants. Citrus fruits and \\ngreenhouse production (mostly eggplants) are the main source of income. Almost 90% of \\ncitrus produced are oranges and the rest are lemons and tangerines. The products are marketed \\nvia merchants to the domestic 'high-price' market in Istanbul. The Fruit Producers' \\nOrganisation has 51 members in \\u00c7avd\\u0131r. So far, this producer organisation has mainly worked \\nto obtain the GI status. The average annual household income is around 10 000 TL based on \\nagriculture. Very few villagers work as tradesmen or porters in logistics firms. \\n \\nHygiene, standards and organic production are mentioned by farmers when defining food \\nquality. The special product is Finike oranges. The main difference in characteristics is due to \\nthe climate of the region. Producers are aware that they benefit from using Finike orange as a \\n 62\\nbrand name. However, merchants also use the name \\\"Finike\\\" for oranges produced in other \\nregions to benefit from its reputation. \\n  \\nProduction without the use of chemicals/pesticides is seen as organic farming by the \\nproducers, and GAP is regarded by farmers as controlled farming. They know about GIs and \\nespecially the PDO Finike oranges, mainly through the Fruit Producers' Organisation, and \\nthey also reported that there are no applications of GAP or organic farming in the region. The \\nfarmers do not believe that introducing organic farming or GAP will create any additional \\nbenefits but may only protect their current status by obtaining a certificate. The average size \\nof the citrus orchards is 1 ha and around 200 households have additional greenhouse areas, \\nwith, on average, less than 0.1 ha. The fruit trees are mainly irrigated by 'flood irrigation' and \\nthe producers mentioned that an orange orchard of less than 0.5 ha is not economically \\nfeasible. \\n \\nAs a result of building greenhouses, fruit orchards are found to be decreasing in recent years. \\nSprinkler irrigation is increasingly used in production but there are no other attempts to \\nincrease the product quality. Producers are not well-organised but there are some emerging \\ndevelopments. The net profit earned from the production is decreasing mainly due to \\nincreasing input prices and decreasing sale prices. \\n \\nThe advantages are climate, soil and experience. The disadvantages are decreasing \\nprofitability and the presence of gravel roads in close proximity to orchards (causing dust and \\nlice on fruits). \\n \\nFarmers have mainly invested in sprinkler irrigation systems (10 000 TL/ha) in recent years \\nand financed them mainly from their own capital, but also partly from subsidised bank credits. \\n \\n5.1.9. Mersin \\u2013 citrus  \\nMersin is one of the leading Turkish regions for citrus production. \\n \\nRRA (Demirhisar Village)  \\nDemirhisar village in Mersin province has 192 households and a population of 1 200. Citrus \\nfruits and vegetables (eggplants and green peppers) are the main source of income. In \\naddition, each household has 1 to 2 cows for subsistence. The village is famous for the \\n'Washington' orange variety, with the best produce found in K\\u0131z\\u0131lalan region. In this region \\nthere are around 6 000 ha of orange orchards. The average yield is around 70 tons/ha ranging \\nfrom 40 to 100 tons/ha. \\n \\nOranges are generally sold to local merchants and sometimes directly to exporters who come \\nto the village. Oranges are mainly sold in bulk directly from the orchard. In addition, some \\noranges are sold in the Mersin Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale Market via agents. No \\ncooperatives exist in Demirhisar but around 20 people are members of an Agricultural Credit \\nCooperative in a neighbouring village. \\n \\nThe average annual income is around 4 000 TL from citrus and vegetables. Farmers define \\nproduct quality as free of pesticides. Oranges are the special product of the region. Oranges \\nfrom this region are sold in the local market and in large cities, and compete with Finike \\noranges (PDO). Therefore to compete, producers would need to develop a brand name for \\nK\\u0131z\\u0131lalan oranges. There are no other products claiming similarity with K\\u0131z\\u0131lalan oranges but \\n 63\\nK\\u0131z\\u0131lalan oranges are sold as Finike oranges in some markets. Organic farming is understood \\nto mean pesticide-free production, and no application of organic farming exists among \\nvillagers. Producers have not heard about GAP and GIs. Due to the location of the village the \\nproduction area is limited and interest in new production technologies is low. \\n \\nIn Demirhisar 192 households have orange trees on a total area of 170 ha. Sizes of orange \\norchards vary as 35 % have less than 0.5 ha, 40 % between 0.5-1 ha and 25 % more than 1 ha. \\nIn the village some farmers cultivate vegetables by renting around 50 ha. \\n \\nProducers claimed that orange farm sizes have decreased during the last decade. Small farms \\nhave abandoned agriculture as people instead go to work in Mersin. Drip irrigation is \\nincreasing and there has been no change in processing or marketing. There is an interest in \\nimproving the quality of the products by lowering the pesticide use. Profits are falling due to \\nlow retail prices and high input prices. \\n \\nThe advantages are the geographical characteristics of the region (providing the favourable \\norange colour), expertise and the climate (humidity and wind), but land plots are small and \\nfragmented causing disadvantages. Producers also stated that they receive bank credits to \\nafford the investment in drip irrigation (around 4 000-5 000 TL per ha). They mentioned high \\nfertilizer prices which result in obtaining small sized products due to undernourishment. The \\nwater price is another topic that farmers have been complaining about (around 1 000 TL/ha). \\nIf two instalments are not paid, the water supply is cut off and interest is charged on a daily \\nbasis. \\n \\n5.1.10. Burdur \\u2013 milk  \\nUpon rapid development after the 1990s, Burdur became one of the leading milk production \\nregions due to the donation of Holstein cows, for milk production, in a joint-venture project \\nwith Holland. This generated major interest around the region and among farmers. The soil is \\nnot very fertile, and therefore, many farmers shifted to milk production. The strength of \\ncooperatives also contributed to the improvement of dairy cow breeding in this region. \\nAccording to the data from the Burdur Provincial Directorate of Agriculture (BPDA), 99 % of \\nthe producers are cooperative members and 98 % use Holstein type cows for milk production. \\nThere are 19 000 members in 141 different cooperatives which form K\\u00f6y-Koop, representing \\n106 000 cows producing around 750 to 800 tons of milk/day. \\n \\nOwing to the developed nature of the cooperatives and the general agreement between \\nmembers; improvements in terms of quality are easily adapted and there are milk collection \\ncentres in villages and small towns, which decrease the risk of microbial contamination after \\nmilking. In addition, there is a memorandum of agreement by BPDA to fine milk collecting in \\nunhygienic conditions and also to support the presence of experienced personnel at the milk \\ncollection centres. In addition, the likelihood of having antibiotics in milk has been reduced as \\nthis is also tested during collection. In the case of positive samples, the responsible farmer \\ncould be identified and he incurs the cost of all the milk collected. Villages have started to \\nbuild milking centres to increase the milk quality, and dairies pay premiums for milk from \\nmilking centres. \\n \\nK\\u00f6y-Koop is the primary responsible central cooperative in the marketing of all the milk \\nobtained in Burdur. Nationwide firms such as Ak G\\u0131da (60 %), Y\\u00f6r\\u00fcko\\u011flu, Cebeci, P\\u0131nar and \\nEkici are the main buyers. Around 10 plants located in Burdur, like Bur-s\\u00fct, \\u00c7avu\\u015fo\\u011flu etc., \\n 64\\nare also important buyers. The capacities of the dairy plants in Burdur are around 400 tons of \\nmilk/day. Each plant announces the amount they will buy daily and pays in advance, based on \\na 3-month deal with the K\\u00f6y-Koop. \\n \\nBur-s\\u00fct, with a capacity of around 50 tons/day, has obtained milk from 8 different \\ncooperatives and processes a further 12 tons/day (November 2008). It has 25 workers in \\nprocessing and produces yoghurt and cheese. The selling points are markets in the Burdur. \\n \\nRRA (B\\u00fc\\u011fd\\u00fcz village) \\nB\\u00fc\\u011fd\\u00fcz village in the Burdur province has 600 households and a population of 1 800. The \\nmain sources of income are milk and cattle farming. Feed crops (clover) are also cultivated. \\nMilk is marketed via the cooperative and fresh meat is sold to merchants. The producers in \\nthe village are either members of the Agricultural Development Cooperative of K\\u00f6y-Koop \\n(450 members) or of the Cattle Breeders Association (CBA). The cooperative is responsible \\nfor collecting raw milk and carries out the marketing for the farmers. It also provides \\nveterinary services, feed and fertilizers. The average income of a household is around 5 000 \\nTL, almost exclusively from agriculture. \\n \\nFarmers define hygiene (especially the microbial count of milk) and the ratio of dry matter to \\nfat content in milk as quality. They also claim that their milk has different characteristics \\nowing to climate and their special feeding method. Their organisational strength \\n(cooperatives) and the presence of milk collection centres in each village and their expertise \\nare the main factors for increasing the quality of milk. Farmers know the basics about organic \\nfarming (production without fertilizers and pesticides), they have no information about GAP \\n(they have not heard about it) and have no knowledge of GIs. They have no intention of \\nproducing with GAP or implementing organic production but they are aware of the fact that \\ncertifications could add value to their products.  \\n \\nThe average number of cows is 7 to 8 per farmer, about 20 farmers have more than 10 and \\n180 farmers have less than 5 cows. The calves born each year are raised and generally sold \\nwithin the first year. The land suitable for arable cultivation is very limited and is mainly used \\nto grow feed for dairy cattle. \\n \\nThe average number of cattle owned by farmers decreased from 10 cows to 7 to 8 during the \\nlast decade, mainly due to the high prices for heifers. The strength of the cooperatives has \\nenabled small farmers to survive. The creation of collection centres is one of the biggest \\nachievements, leading to the building of milking centres in the villages. The increased usage \\nof stainless steel material in the milking process has improved milk quality. The net profit \\nearned from milk production is decreasing mainly due to decreasing real milk prices, and \\nincreasing of feed and veterinary service prices. \\n \\nThe advantages of milk production are the suitability of the land for animal breeding and the \\nwell-organised production structure (cooperatives). Farmers have not invested individually in \\ntechnology. Almost all investments in milking machines are made via the cooperative and the \\ncosts incurred are deducted from the revenues from milk marketing. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 65\\n5.1.11. Konya and Karaman \\u2013 milk  \\nKonya - Ere\\u011fli \\nAccording to the District Directorate of Agriculture there are 121 380 sheep, 5 600 goats, \\n30 710 cattle, and 10 790 calves in Konya - Ere\\u011fli (2008). In the region, 1 500 ha were used \\nfor the production of clover (180 000 tons) and 1 500 ha for maize in 2006. In the same year \\n136 000 tons wheat, 56 000 tons barley, 16 200 tons rye, and 10 800 tons maize were \\nproduced. The total agricultural area is 12 435 ha, of which 4 977 ha are irrigated. The total \\npasture area is 7 683 ha. In 2007, 21 milk plants bought around 178 000 tons of milk from \\n102 000 producers. However, only 54 000 tons of milk were eligible for intensive milk \\npremiums as they met the principal hygienic conditions, accounting for 30% of total milk \\nsold. The region has plants with a capacity above 50 000 tons per year; like Akbel (245 000 \\nton), Bah\\u00e7e Cold Storage and Food (90 000 ton) and Meys\\u00fct (54 000 ton). \\n \\nAccording to the agricultural engineer from the Konya Cattle Breeders' Association (CBA) it \\nis estimated that 7 200 farmers are involved in animal breeding. Almost 4 753 farmers are \\nregistered with the CBA and 4 696 of them are individual farmers, 45 private firms, 4 public \\nenterprises and 328 cooperatives, and the average number of cows owned by these members \\nare 10.3, 78.7, 223.5 and 49.6 respectively. \\n \\nIn Halkap\\u0131nar the total number of cattle is 29 155, of which 11 562 are dairy cows. In Konya \\nthe total number of cattle is 133 489, of which 54 187 are dairy cows. Around 21.3% of the \\ntotal dairy cows are in Ere\\u011fli and Halkap\\u0131nar. For the members of CBA, the average number \\nof cattle is 28 and of dairy cattle is 10.3. The biggest farm is Akbel with 486 cows. The \\naverage milk production per farm household is 21-22 kg/day or 6 500 kg/year. CBA members \\nare benefiting from the following services provided by CBA: \\n1) Artificial insemination \\n2) Pregnancy check \\n3) Genital inflammation control \\n4) ID record (0-6 month); a) birth date, b) sex, c) mother identity d) variety \\n5) Certificated seed supply for fodder production \\n6) Supply of feed additives (vitamins, minerals, premix) \\n7) Heifer supply (from members to members or agricultural development cooperatives or \\nother associations) \\n8) Milking machinery units (for farmers with +50 cows or for small farmers; price in \\n2008 was almost 1 000 TL/unit) \\n9) Disinfectant material and equipment \\n \\nCBA officials have claimed that the region is not suitable for GAP as the plants in the area are \\nnot disease-free. \\n \\nDairy plants collect raw milk from a) farmers directly b) producer associations and c) \\ncooperatives. The large dairies, such as Ak G\\u0131da, S\\u00fcta\\u015f and Akbel, prefer large farms for \\npurchasing milk as they have collecting tanks. In addition, some milk is marketed to firms \\nthrough 'milk agents'. The milk produced from small farms is left in small containers for a \\nwhile and is later collected by small dairies that locally produce dairy products. \\n \\nThe major problems related to milk in the region, reported by CBA, are the misuse of \\nantibiotics (lack of education and training), lack of milking utilities and unhygienic \\nconditions, incorrect feeding (affecting the fat and acid content of milk) and mastitis. In the \\ncase of selling milk containing antibiotics; if exposed, the seller is omitted from the list and \\n 66\\nfined. Beef cattle are sold on the regional market and slaughtered by companies like Ma\\u00e7, \\nAydost and Cihangir. \\n \\nMeys\\u00fct  \\nMeys\\u00fct started its production in 2002 and has operated since 2004 with a capacity of more \\nthan 100 tons/day. The firm produces only UHT milk and employs 65 workers and sells its \\nproduct under different brand names like Bolkar, Talas, Enka and Akbel, mostly in east and \\nsouth eastern parts of Turkey and in regional markets. The firm\\u2019s products are sold in \\nnationwide markets like Kipa-Tesco, Ayta\\u00e7, Yimpa\\u015f and Saray under their brand name. The \\nfirm has ISO-EN-22000 and HACCP certifications. It has 4 'milk agents' collecting milk from \\nthe farms with cooling tanks. \\n \\nMeys\\u00fct analyzes raw milk for acidity (pH), brix, alcohol, hydrogen-peroxide, fat content, \\nantibiotics, and performs sensory analysis. All the information concerning the tanker, amount, \\narrival hour and collected centres are recorded. The firm\\u2019s workers also check the area where \\nmilk is collected before it is transferred to the plant. Also five experts give training to the milk \\nproducers in terms of hygiene (safety), and the quality has improved since 2007 (considering \\nthe results of alcohol tests). \\n \\nThe plant manager has a doctorate in milk processing and is very experienced. He indicated \\nthat they also carry out pesticide and aflatoxin tests.  \\n \\nKonya Ere\\u011fli Milk Producers Association  \\nIt was founded in 2006 with 19 members and as of November 2008 had 75 members (milk \\nproducers), and it has become a major milk collector in the region. The daily milk collection \\nquantity is around 70 tons and it is sold to major nationwide collectors such as Ak G\\u0131da (35 \\ntons), S\\u00fcta\\u015f (10 tons) and Meys\\u00fct (20-22 tons). The market share of the association in Ere\\u011fli \\nwas around 30% in 2008. \\n \\nThe primary condition to become a member is to supply at least 200 litres milk/day, which \\nrequires at least 15 cows. The average number of cows is above 40 and there are 9 \\ncooperatives among the members. There are also two enterprise members with more than 650 \\ncows each. \\n \\nMembers benefit from training on general hygiene, animal feeding etc. free of charge and also \\nreceive animal feed at a discounted rate. Additionally, they obtain certified disinfectants. The \\nassociation collects milk from its members and test samples in its own laboratories for general \\nquality and hygiene standards. Only cooled raw milk is purchased, in order to secure a \\ncomplete cold chain from milking to the dairies. Members disregarding the general hygiene \\nstandards (milk without antibiotics etc.) and Food Codex are expelled from the association. \\nThe microbial count of raw milk is within the legal limits and decreasing, members have to \\npay an entrance fee below the minimum wage. The association also tests for alcohol (not a \\nlegal mandate) to check whether the milk is pure and to extend the shelf life of UHT milk. \\nThe number of members is increasing, mainly due to the incentives added to milk prices by \\nthe association in 2007. \\n \\nKonya-\\u00c7umra \\nOk\\u00e7u, in the village \\u00c7umra, has 600 households with a population of 2 200. The main sources \\nof income are wheat, barley, sugar beet, beans, maize, fodder crops and dairy cattle. Local \\ntraders sell these products in the market. Milk is collected by the producers\\u2019 organisation or \\n 67\\nmilk collectors and the producers' organisation also serves to increase the general hygiene and \\nmilk quality. \\n \\nIn \\u00c7umra there are 80 000 sheep and 33 000 cattle, including 12 000 dairy cows. The annual \\nmilk yield is 5 tons per cow. The agricultural area is around 100 000 ha, about 70% of which \\nis irrigated. Around 60 to 65% of the land is planted with wheat and barley, followed by sugar \\nbeet, cereals and maize (6 500 ha). \\n \\nMilk produced in \\u00c7umra is collected by contractors from Konya. Collected raw milk is left \\noutdoors in plastic containers and collectors use cooling tanks and transfer them to the dairies. \\nThere is a 2% tax on the producer. The Milk Producer Organisation has 72 members, CBA \\n\\u00c7umra Branch has 500 members and there are 3 Agricultural Development Cooperatives. \\n \\n\\u00c7umra Milk Producer Organisation  \\nThe total number of cattle of its 72 members is 1 765, around 25 per member. The association \\nserves its members in terms of cleaning and hygiene, cooling tanks and milking machinery. A \\ntotal of 15 cooling tanks exist with a capacity of around 1 or 2 tons each. Each day around \\n12 200 litres of milk are collected and sold to Ak G\\u0131da (7 500 litre), Sek S\\u00fct (3 000 litre) and \\nOva S\\u00fct (1 700 litre). The milk marketed by the association is tested in terms of the Food \\nCodex and minimum quality and hygiene requirements. If the milk contains antibiotics or \\nwater, there is a high penalty and membership can be cancelled. Veterinarians and food \\nengineers train members on milk quality and hygiene. The annual fee was around 125 TL in \\n2008. In this district, there is a sugar plant and sugar beet is also cultivated and given to the \\ncows as feed, but if the cow is overfed the milk fat content decreases, water content increases \\nalong with the risk of sickness. Therefore, members\\u2019 cows should not be fed with sugar beet. \\nMembers produce around 85% of their feed on their own farms. \\n \\nRRA (\\u00dc\\u00e7harman in Karaman-Ayranc\\u0131) \\nThere are 460 people living in 130 households where the main income is from wheat, barley \\nand sheep farming. Cheese is made from sheep's milk and lamb is sold as fresh meat to Ere\\u011fli. \\n20% of the produced wheat is sold to merchants and the Turkish Grain Board (TMO), the rest \\nis used for self-consumption. Cheese made from sheep's milk is placed in a lamb skin and \\nstored in June in a 36-metre deep underground cave (obruk) and stored there until October-\\nNovember (5 to 6 months). This cheese is known as Divle Obruk cheese and is sold at 17-18 \\nTL/kg whereas lamb's milk is sold at 1 TL/kg so the added value is very high. The village has \\nan Agricultural Development Cooperative with 72 members, which was founded by cattle \\nbreeders from a neighbouring town, K\\u0131raman. The cooperative is supported by a Rural Social \\nSupport Project where each member with at least two cows is supported and members sell \\ntheir milk to Arpac\\u0131 Milk Plant in the near Ere\\u011fli district. The average annual income is 4 000 \\nTL and everybody is involved in agriculture. In the village, 750 ha are planted to wheat and \\nbarley (by 120 producers) and there are 5 000 lambs (owned by 70 farmers) and 200 cattle \\n(owned by 30 farmers). During the last decade there have been severe droughts, thus \\ndecreasing the fertility of the land and productivity. Producers graze the sheep on pastures and \\nfeed the cows with feed produced on their own land. \\n \\nProducers understand hygienic conditions as representing food quality, and the special \\nproduct of the region is Divle Obruk cheese. During the time in the underground cave a red \\nmould covers the lamb skin giving the cheese a unique flavour. A firm in Karaman province \\n(Fidan Milk Plant) has registered a cheese brand under the same name, but the chief of the \\nvillage has sued the firm. There are many fake products marketed in the region under the \\n 68\\nsame name that are produced from a sheep/cow's milk mixture and kept in cold rooms. The \\nvillage, together with the head officials of the district, has applied to the Turkish Patent \\nInstitution (TPE) for GI certificates but they have been denied due to the lack of a proposed \\nprocedure to assess the cheese quality. In the 2007-2008 season around 60 tons of cheese \\nwere stored underground with a value of around 1 000 000 TL. The cave is under the control \\nof the villagers and the management takes 0.5 TL/kg fee. \\n \\nProducers are not aware of organic farming, GAP or GI. During the last decade the number of \\nsheep has decreased from 32 000 in the early 1970s to around 8 000 in 2000 and to 5 000 in \\n2009. Small producers ceased production and many also left the village. Therefore the \\nremaining population is generally elderly. During the last decade no technological \\ndevelopment has been made in terms of cheese production. The producers' organisation is \\npoor and the sheep breeding has additionally slowed during the droughts. There is a decrease \\nin net profit because of higher input costs and lower retail prices of milk, meat and livestock. \\n \\nThe main advantage of the region is the specific production method of Divle Obruk cheese \\nfrom sheep's milk. The disadvantages are the lack of water, droughts and ageing population. \\nThe new members of the Agricultural Development Cooperative in the village are investing in \\nmilking machinery, building a new barn and wells. \\n \\n5.2. Summary results of RRA studies \\n \\nIn Table 18 socio-economic and demographic structures of the selected village are presented, \\nand producers' answers regarding quality issues are assessed in five different levels ranking \\nfrom 'too weak', 'weak', 'fair', 'good' to 'excellent', and taken as 1 to 5, respectively. During the \\nevaluation of answers, no answers and wrong/false answers were categorised as 'too weak'; \\npartially correct answers as 'weak'; correct answers combined with no applications as 'fair'; \\nsome applications as 'good'; and both correct answers and applications as 'excellent'. \\n \\n 69 \\nTable 18: Summary results of RRA studies with farmers in villages  \\nProvince  \\n(sub-province) \\nEvaluation \\ncriterions  \\nAfyon.

This is a handicap for expansion and \\ninvestment in quality. Therefore, producers could be clustered into producer organisations to \\ncollaborate in quality production. Moreover, it is necessary to support GI certification of products \\ncomplying with the required quality. Legal regulations to allow price determination according to \\nquality criteria or policies including quality premium may also provide incentives for investment in \\nquality improvement measures.  \\n0\\n2000\\n4000\\n6000\\n8000\\n10000\\n12000\\nBeef (Afyon)\\nOlive oil (Ayvalik)\\nTomatoes (Kumluca)\\nApples (Egirdir)\\nGrapes - raisins (Alasehir)\\nDried figs (Aydin)\\nDried apricots (Malatya)\\nCitrus (Finike)\\nCitrus (Mersin)\\nMilk (Afyon)\\nMilk (Burdur)\\nMilk (Konya & Karaman)\\nAverage annual\\nhousehold income (TL)\\n  \\nFigure 6: Radar chart for socio-economic structure of producers10 \\n \\nFigure 7 provides an overview on the current knowledge of producers regarding different food quality \\nconcepts.  \\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nBeef (Afyon)\\nOlive oil (Ayvalik)\\nTomatoes (Kumluca)\\nApples (Egirdir)\\nGrapes - raisins (Alasehir)\\nDried figs (Aydin)\\nDried apricots (Malatya)\\nCitrus (Finike)\\nCitrus (Mersin)\\nMilk (Afyon)\\nMilk (Burdur)\\nMilk (Konya & Karaman)\\nQuality\\nOrganic production\\nGood Agricultural\\nPractices (GAP)\\nGeographical\\nIndications (Gis)\\n  \\nFigure 7: Radar chart for producers\\u2019 awareness about quality and quality systems \\n \\n                                                 \\n10 The exchange rate for Turkish Lira (TL) in June, 2009 is 1 \\u20ac = 2.15 TL  \\n 73\\nThere is also a misunderstanding regarding the concept of GIs (Figure 8). For example, some products \\nhave a PGI certificate even if they are not eligible for PGI status but should be classified with TSG \\ncertificates. This would certify the traditional production method and not be linked to the origin of the \\nproduct or the location of the elaboration process. This option is not included in the current Turkish \\nlegislation concerning GIs but is embedded in the draft law. In addition, it is possible to obtain \\ncertification with other quality marks (like \\\"Woolmark\\\") but there is no application as those quality \\nmarks are often unknown.  \\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nBeef (Afyon)\\nOlive oil (Ayvalik)\\nTomato (Kumluca)\\nApple (Egirdir)\\nGrape - Raisins (Alasehir)\\nDried Fig (Aydin)\\nDried Apricot (Malatya)\\nCitrus (Finike)\\nCitrus (Mersin)\\nMilk (Afyon)\\nMilk (Burdur)\\nMilk (Konya & Karaman)\\nInterest in quality  sy stems\\nInterest in  GAP and/or\\norganic production\\nInterest in protected\\nproduction (GIs)\\n  \\nFigure 8: Radar chart of producers\\u2019 interest \\n \\nThe interest of producers in quality production is rapidly developing; however their interest in organic \\nfarming and GAP is low. Most producers have heard about and are interested in GIs whereas their \\nexpectations of benefits derived from GIs or organic farming and/or GAP were not high enough to \\nwarrant their investment in them (Figure 9). \\n \\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nBeef  (Af y on)\\nOliv e oil (Ay v alik)\\nTomato (Kumluca)\\nApple (Egirdir)\\nGrape - Raisins (Alasehir)\\nDried Fig (Ay din)\\nDried Apricot (Malaty a)\\nCitrus (Finike)\\nCitrus (Mersin)\\nMilk (Af y on)\\nMilk (Burdur)\\nMilk (Kony a & Karaman)\\nProf it and contribution\\nof  GAP and/or organic\\nproduction\\nProf it and contribution\\nof  protected products\\n(GIs)\\n \\nFigure 9: Radar chart of producers\\u2019 expectations \\n \\n 74\\nThe products are evaluated in relation to the criteria elaborated by Hayes et al. (2003) for successful \\ndifferentiation of agricultural products in Table 20. Products which have at least one excellent \\nevaluation are considered to be potentially successful in obtaining GI certificates, converting to \\norganic production and/or implementing GAP. The information presented relates to the structural \\nobservation in the RRA (marketing power, infrastructure investments, governmental supports and \\nspecial sub-products). \\n \\nTable 20: Evaluation of products (according to differentiation criteria) \\nProduct Region \\nThe product could \\ntransmit price signals \\nfrom consumers to \\nproducers \\nThe production scale \\ncould be sufficiently \\nlarge to justify the costs \\nof creating and \\nmaintaining a \\ndifferentiated image \\namong consumers \\nImitations of the \\nproduct could be \\nprevented \\nMethods of supply \\ncontrol could not \\nviolate price fixing \\nlaws  \\nBeef and \\nmeat \\nproducts \\nAfyon. good good good excellent \\nOlive oil Balikesir (Ayvalik) good good good excellent \\nTomatoes Antalya (Kumluca) excellent moderate weak good \\nApples Isparta (Egirdir) good moderate weak excellent \\nGrapes - \\nraisins \\nManisa \\n(Alasehir) moderate good weak moderate \\nDried figs Aydin good moderate good excellent \\nDried \\napricots Malatya good moderate moderate excellent \\nCitrus Antalya (Finike) excellent good weak good \\nCitrus Mersin moderate moderate weak good \\nMilk and \\ndairy \\nproducts \\nAfyon. good excellent moderate good \\nMilk and \\ndairy \\nproducts \\nBurdur good good moderate moderate \\nMilk and \\ndairy \\nproducts \\nKonya and \\nKaraman good good good moderate \\n \\nIn addition, there are some important observations regarding the regions. In Afyon, the only purpose of \\nachieving a PGI for sucuk production is for the protection of the traditional production methods, not \\nfor marketing reasons. The labour costs in olive oil production are high and many small shops exist in \\nAyvalik (Balikesir). Food safety is a priority for tomato production in Kumluca, Antalya, and grape \\nand raisin production in Alasehir (Manisa) strive to comply with export market requirements and \\nrequested export formalities. Apple production in Egirdir (Isparta) is convenient for GAP applications \\nbecause there is a limited but well-equipped production area (such as drip irrigation systems, pesticide \\npreparation areas, warehouses, packaging units etc.). Fig producers in Aydin could charge higher \\nprices for their product because it is a unique place for producing high quality dried figs. Dried \\napricots are sold in bulk so it is impossible to use GIs in Malatya. Orange producers in Antalya also get \\nhigher prices for their product because Finike oranges have a unique taste and the harvesting period is \\n 75\\nalmost one month earlier than other varieties. There are marketing advantages for orange producers in \\nMersin because its location is so close to the citrus exporters and fresh-cut fruit and fruit juice \\nproducers. Buffalo milk producers in Afyon could add extra value to milk by producing traditional \\nmilk products (cream). Milk producers in Burdur get premium milk prices because the producers are \\nvery well clustered within cooperatives in this region. Milk producers in Konya and Karaman could \\nadd value by producing cheese.  \\nAs a result, by combining the evaluation with the assessment of the regions, it is found that some \\nproducts could potentially be successful candidates for GIs: \\n\\u2022 Ayvalik olive oil; \\n\\u2022 Finike oranges; \\n\\u2022 Afyonkarahisar cream; and \\n\\u2022 Afyonkarahisar sucuk (whether this product could achieve a premium price versus private \\nbrands needs to be analysed). \\n \\nSome products were determined as having potential for organic production: \\n\\u2022 Dried apricots; \\n\\u2022 Dried figs; \\n\\u2022 Milk (only for medium and large scale farms); and  \\n\\u2022 Beef (only for medium and large scale farms). \\n \\nSome products were determined as favourable for GAP application: \\n\\u2022 Citrus produce; \\n\\u2022 Apples; \\n\\u2022 Tomatoes; \\n\\u2022 Milk (the disease-free status of the region should be announced by TKB); and   \\n\\u2022 Meat (the disease-free status of the region should be announced by TKB). \\nIn addition, Divle Obruk cheese in Konya and Karaman could be certificated with a TSG. \\n \\n 76\\n6. Conclusions and recommendations \\nConclusions \\n\\u2022 Lack of quality awareness of consumers and producers is determined as one of the main \\nproblems from the SWOT and LFM studies. Producers' knowledge is limited and their quality \\nperception focuses mainly on food safety. Furthermore disorganised small scale producers are \\nunable to solve quality issues by themselves.  \\n\\u2022 The coordination and collaboration among actors in the food chain are very weak in terms of \\ndeveloping and ensuring a quality assurance scheme, resulting in problems in supplying \\nreliable quality products to markets. Different organisations and institutions are also \\nresponsible for different aspects of quality production and assurance. Moreover, there are many \\ninstitutional conflicts, not only with regards to the relationship between organisations and/or \\ninstitutions but also within organisations and their own implementations. \\n\\u2022 Incentives for food quality through complementary procedures do not exist. Thus, SMEs and \\nagricultural holdings are not supported financially to improve quality assurance, therefore \\nlimiting investments in quality production. In conclusion, it is difficult for small producers and \\nenterprises to accumulate capital to improve product quality, which might lead to exclusion \\nfrom dynamic food markets. \\n\\u2022 There are barriers in exports due to quality that reduce the Turkish share in world food markets. \\nHowever, the infrastructure regarding food safety issues, such as minimum legal requirements, \\nrequested by importing country authorities and/or multinational food retail chains has generally \\nbeen improved. \\n\\u2022 Key stakeholders are not sufficiently organised to obtain GI certification for the important food \\nproducts in their region. This leads to overlaps among certified products and failure in product \\nprotection. Moreover, producers were uninformed about GIs and have little interest in GIs due \\nto their small scale. \\n\\u2022 There was only one producer organisation (producer union) established by the region\\u2019s \\nproducers with a GI certificate. The other certifications were obtained by cooperatives, \\nchambers of commerce and industry, municipalities and provincial governance. \\n\\u2022 Only tomato producers achieved GAP applications among selected products. \\n\\u2022 Lack of trust in quality certification audits and auditing competences leads to moral hazards.  \\n\\u2022 Observations showed that there were great quality improvements in milk production; the milk \\nquality now exceeds the minimum Food Codex requirements. The main driver for this \\nimprovement is the existence of large scale national and international dairy companies pushing \\nforward quality standards in the market. However, small producers could be excluded from this \\ndynamic market because of their traditional production techniques and infrastructure which \\ndoes not fulfil buyers' requirements. \\n\\u2022 Through the RRA studies on participation of small-scale producers in organic farming it was \\nalso observed that they voiced low interest.  \\n\\u2022 Academic studies and research projects (funded by TUBITAK \\u2013 The Scientific and \\nTechnological Research Council of Turkey) are limited in number and also require an \\nimprovement in quality. \\n \\n \\nRecommendations \\n\\u2022 Quality awareness of consumers and producers must be improved by training and by using \\ncommunication means to effectively overcome food quality assurance schemes problems in \\nTurkey. To serve this purpose, institutions like TKB, DPT, TPE, TSE, TZOB etc. should \\ncooperate. \\n\\u2022 There should be cooperation between TKB and MEB (the Ministry of National Education) in \\nraising awareness of students in compulsory education. \\n 77\\n\\u2022 Public awareness raising campaigns should be organised, supported by sector associations \\n(NGOs), TKB and other public institutes. Meetings with mass media representatives and \\njournalists should be organised on the topic of food quality; public TV channels (TRT) and \\nother national and also local coverage channels should keep the topic 'hot' on their agenda. \\n\\u2022 There is a need for a complementary perspective and coordination among responsible \\ninstitutions on food quality.  \\n\\u2022 Infrastructure investments for improving food quality assurance systems should be sustained by \\nTKB and other related institutes parallel to the development and quality and safety demands of \\nthe domestic and international markets. \\n\\u2022 Quality infrastructure development projects should be sustained by using EU and/or World \\nBank (WB) grants.  \\n\\u2022 TKB should design support schemes for further improving food quality which must cover GIs \\nand trademark certified products.  \\n\\u2022 The Under-Secretary of Foreign Trade (DTM) should support exports of safety and quality \\nguaranteed products and should also conduct market research on products with organic labels \\nand a high level of quality standards.  \\n\\u2022 KOSGEB (The Supporter Association of SMEs in Turkey) and TKB should associate rural \\ndevelopment supports with traceability applications. \\n\\u2022 The EU accession period should not be interrupted and the adoption period of the legislation \\nshould be completed accordingly. \\n\\u2022 Future research may focus on supply chain analysis and obstacles in collaboration between key \\nactors, consumer response to quality in domestic markets, and on a model to prevent small \\nscale producers being excluded from dynamic markets.  \\n \\n \\n 78\\nReferences \\nAlpay, S., I.

The governance structure of food quality assurance in Turkey is explained, which includes \\npublic, semi-public and private institutes, laws and legislations, policies and research.  Lack of consumer and \\nproducer quality awareness is determined as the main problem by SWOT and Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) \\nstudies. A Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) study was conducted by interviewing local stakeholders. Turkish \\nproducers' knowledge is limited and their quality perception focuses mainly on food safety. There are barriers in \\nexports due to quality that reduce the Turkish share in world food markets. The study concludes with several \\nrecommendations on how problems in Turkish food quality assurance schemes could be effectively overcome.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHow to obtain EU publications \\n \\nOur priced publications are available from EU Bookshop (http://bookshop.europa.eu), where you can place \\nan order with the sales agent of your choice. \\n \\nThe Publications Office has a worldwide network of sales agents.

      "        \"abstract\": \"European food industries are responsible for the safety of the food products brought on the market. Therefore, a legal demanded food safety management system (FSMS) or self-checking system (SCS) is implemented in companies, often based on commercial quality assurance standards as ISO22000, BRC or IFS. The Belgian government provides the possibility for food business operators to have their SCS approved by means of audits conducted by either the competent food safety authority, FASFC, or by a commercial certification body,  recognised by the government. The audits are based on specifically developed guides for self-checking per sector, approved by the Belgian government. In view of evaluating the effect of the self-checking system certification on the performance of an implemented FSMS and the companies\\u2019 microbiological food safety output, this paper presents the results of an independent self-assessment conducted by eighty-two food business operators in Belgium. The study was conducted in spring/summer of 2010. The outcome of this study is discussed against national inspection results by the FASFC of the year 2009, 2010 and 2011 in Belgian food companies. The enforcement of a SCS by the Belgian government on the performance of a FSMS, their food safety output and their inspection results is less clear for food processing companies compared to the positive effect for the distribution sector. The majority of food processing companies were already certified for a voluntary system next to the legal demanded SCS. No significant difference could be identified between SCS certified and non-certified companies; large, medium or small scale companies and the sector in which they are working for food processing companies. Five clusters could be identified in the performance of a FSMS and microbiological food safety output. In overall Belgian processing companies are having a good performing FSMS and microbiological food safety output\",\n",

The \\napproach is compliant with the ESG standards and guidelines and as such can be used for other quality standards. \\n \\nKey words: quality assurance, internal audit, improvements, ESG \\n \\n \\n1. UVOD \\n \\nPostupci povezani s procesom osiguravanja kvalitete \\nunutar Europskog prostora visokog obrazovanja postaju \\nsve kompleksniji i sofisticiraniji. Visoka u\\u010dili\\u0161ta se \\npoti\\u010de na posve\\u0107ivanje osobite pozornosti pra\\u0107enju, \\nprovjeravanju i vrednovanju svih aspekata svoje \\ndjelatnosti te uspostavi usporedivih kriterija procjene i \\npripadnih metodologija. Sve ovo vodi  izgradnji \\ncjelovitih sustava osiguravanja kvalitete. \\nIzgradnja sustava za osiguravanje kvalitete (SOK) na \\nvisokim u\\u010dili\\u0161tima (QA) postavljena je kao nu\\u017enost i \\nsvakodnevnica na svim visokim u\\u010dili\\u0161tima te neupitan \\nosnovni pojam i najvi\\u0161e postavljeni cilj Bolonjske \\nreforme. U sredi\\u0161tu sustava za osiguranje kvalitete na \\nvisoko\\u0161kolskim u\\u010dili\\u0161tima sve se vi\\u0161e koristi pojam \\nkulture kvalitete. Rije\\u010d je o pojmu koji prenosi ideju \\nkvalitete kao zajedni\\u010dke vrijednosti i zajedni\\u010dke \\nodgovornosti svih dionika visoko\\u0161kolskih u\\u010dili\\u0161ta, \\nuklju\\u010duju\\u0107i ne samo nastavno nego i administrativno \\nosoblje, studente, poslodavce, zainteresirane udruge, \\u0161iru \\ndru\\u0161tvenu zajednicu i dr. Ovakvo shva\\u0107anje kvalitete \\npodrazumijeva i ugra\\u0111ivanje kontinuiranog \\npobolj\\u0161avanja svih glavnih, upravlja\\u010dkih i logisti\\u010dkih \\nprocesa na u\\u010dili\\u0161tu. Kad je rije\\u010d o operacionalizaciji \\novako na\\u010delnog shva\\u0107anja kulture kvalitete, valja re\\u0107i da \\nipak postoje stanovite smjernice na koje se mogu\\u0107e \\nosloniti u konkretnom djelovanju u visoko\\u0161kolskim \\nu\\u010dili\\u0161tima. U posljednje vrijeme mo\\u017ee se primijetiti da se \\npojam osiguravanja kvalitete sve \\u010de\\u0161\\u0107e povezuje s \\nkonkretnim primjerima dobre prakse na nacionalnoj i na \\nme\\u0111unarodnoj razini, uz brojne poticaje da se kao temelj \\nsustava usvoje Europski standardi i smjernice.  \\n\\u2022 Za uspje\\u0161an postupak prilagodbe navedenim \\nsmjernicama potrebno je provesti: \\n\\u2022 Ustroj sustava za osiguranje kvalitete; \\n\\u2022 Implementaciju smjernica u postoje\\u0107e procese \\nvisokog u\\u010dili\\u0161ta; \\n\\u2022 Interne prosudbe sustava za osiguranje kvalitete; \\n\\u2022 Vanjsku neovisnu prosudbu sustava kvalitete; \\n\\u2022 Proces stalnog pobolj\\u0161avanja efikasnosti sustava za \\nosiguranje kvalitete \\n \\nOsim navedenog, za efikasan i u\\u010dinkovit sustav za \\nosiguravanje kvalitete postavljaju se tri uvjeta: \\n1. sustav mora postojati,  \\n2. sustav mora biti operativan (mora biti odr\\u017eavan) i \\n3. sustav mora biti efikasan (moraju se pokretati mjere \\npobolj\\u0161avanja). \\n \\nSustav postoji ukoliko je implementiran u sve procese \\n(studijske programe, odjele, ustrojbene jedinice i sl.), \\nodnosno ukoliko se mo\\u017ee sagledati i prikazati, i ukoliko \\nse razumije od svih zaposlenika i podr\\u017eava svim \\npotrebnim resursima od najvi\\u0161eg vodstva visokog \\nu\\u010dili\\u0161ta. Da bi se SOK sagledao i prikazao mora imati \\njasnu strukturu te mora imati dokumentirane postupke i \\nostalu potrebnu dokumentaciju koja mora biti \\nraspolo\\u017eiva na mjestima kori\\u0161tenja. \\n172 Technical journal 9, 2(2015), 172-176\\nKondi\\u0107 \\u017d., Vi\\u0161nji\\u0107 V., Ma\\u0111eri\\u0107 D.                                                                                               Osiguravanja kvalitete visokog obrazovanja na primjeru Sveu\\u010dili\\u0161ta Sjever \\n \\nNakon u\\u010dinkovito provedenih postupaka \\nimplementacije SOK-e potrebno ga je odr\\u017eavati. Nekad \\nje lak\\u0161e provesti postupke ustroja i primjene od \\npostupaka odr\\u017eavanja efikasnog sustava. Ako se ne \\nprovode primjerice, mjere kontrole, nadzora ili analiza  \\nmogu\\u0107e je s velikom vjerojatno\\u0161\\u0107u o\\u010dekivati da \\u0107e \\nefikasnost dobro ustrojenog sustava i\\u0107i prema dolje.

Steiner \\n \\n____________________ \\n \\n \\n  \\n  2 \\nIntroduction \\nWith  the  emergence  of  the  first  BSE  case  in  Germany  in  November  2000,  consumer \\nconfidence into the safety of meat products quickly eroded and led to a rapid restructuring of \\ngovernment  agencies  and  policy  instruments  related  to  food  safety.\\n1  Similar to the  1996 \\nrelease of information in Germany about British BSE cases, the arrival of the first BSE cases \\nin Germany in 2000 led to a highly intense and emotional reaction among German consumers \\n(Loy and Steiner, 2004). This intense, though periodic, mass-level attention to BSE is an \\nimportant attribute of contested governance (Ansell  and Vogel, this volume) that has proven \\nto be more distinct in Germany than in France or Britain  (Besan\\u00e7on et al., Rothstein, this \\nvolume). In November 2000, the mass-level attention to BSE did not only lead to a reduction \\nof beef-eating by more than half, but had repercussions for the entire food marketing chain, \\nthe animal breeding industry, the catering business and EU farm policy as a whole (Economist \\n2001; Fox and Peterson 2004). Under political pressure, the federal minister of agriculture \\nannounced the establishment of a new ministry branch solely devoted to food safety, only one \\nweek after the first BSE case was reported.\\n2 One month after the first BSE case, Chancellor \\nSchr\\u00f6der announced that BSE had become one of his top priority issues (\\u201eChefsache\\u201f). When \\nthe  federal  ministers  of  agriculture  and  health  refused  to  consider  further  swift  changes, \\nSchr\\u00f6der forced them to resign in January 2001 and named a female lawyer from the Green \\nparty, Renate K\\u00fcnast, the new minister of agriculture. For the first time in German history, the \\nminister of agriculture came from outside the sector. In addition to the changes in personnel, \\n                                                 \\n1 See Loy and Steiner (2004) for a review of the history of the BSE crisis in Germany and an exploration of \\nprice-setting behavior in the beef supply chain related to the 1996 BSE events. Fox and Peterson (2004) provide \\nfor more detailed scientific background on BSE and a chronology across Europe. \\n2 The Health Ministry was, up to then, fully responsible for handling food safety issues.  \\n  3 \\nthe Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry was renamed as the Ministry of Consumer \\nProtection, Food and Agriculture. \\n \\nIn light of these changes, an important question is: to what extent do the observed institutional \\ngovernance modifications reflect continued contested governance in terms of public distrust, \\nwhen it challenges the legitimacy of institutional arrangements related to food safety (Ansell \\nand Vogel, this volume).\\n3 This chapter attempts to address this issue by exploring  the scope \\nand  effectiveness  of  visual  changes  in  governance  in  Germany,  including  the  policy \\ninstruments that were implemented to address food safety issues and particularly the eroding \\ntrust in public authority. The key role of regaining trust into public authority in this process is \\nechoed by policymakers themselves. Renate K\\u00fcnast identified this as her top priority, by \\nemphasizing that \\u201cTrust through change must be our motto.\\u201d (K\\u00fcnast 2002). David Byrne, \\nEuropean Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, has announced that \\u201cClearly \\nthere is a need to develop trust. The food safety agencies, which have been established in \\nmany European countries, serve as good examples. These agencies create a credible and \\nvisible distance between different government structures with the broad aim of increasing \\ntransparency  which,  in  turn,  bolsters  public  acceptance  and  confidence.\\u201d  (Byrne  2004). \\nHowever, before exploring to what extent these calls for public trust and reduced contestation \\nwere more than cosmetic rhetoric, this chapter first considers some specifics of Germany as \\nthey relate to food safety and food markets in general. \\n                                                 \\n3  \\u201cThroughout  his  book,  North  [1981]  \\u2026  argues  that  good  institutions  will  simultaneously  support  private \\ncontracts and provide checks against expropriation by the government or other politically powerful  groups. \\nThere is a growing consensus among economists and political scientists that the broad outlines of North\\u201fs story \\nare correct: the social, economic, legal and political organization of a society, i.e., its \\u201cinstitutions\\u201d, are a primary \\ndeterminant of economic activity.\\u201d Acemoglu and Johnson (2003: 4).  \\n  4 \\n \\nGermany  could  be  characterized  by  highly  price-sensitive  consumers.  Discounters,  for \\nexample, have gained a market share of close to 40 percent, which is higher than in any other \\nEuropean  country  (M+MPlanetRetail  2002).\\n4  At the same time, only   a small fraction of \\nconsumers  are  purchasing  organic  meat, which  consumers  perceive  as  being  \\u201esafer\\u201f  than \\nconventional meat products.\\n5  \\n \\nGiven Germany\\u201fs traditional reliance on state intervention since the Bismarck Era, a shift \\ntowards  more  industry-led  initiatives  in  the  food  sector  seems,  at  first  sight,  to  be  more \\nchallenging and more appropriate than in other European countries. Industry-led initiatives, \\nsuch as the 2001 voluntary national quality assurance scheme \\u201cQuality and Safety\\u201d (\\u201eQS\\u201f), \\ncan  be  highly  desirable  in  a  world  of  increasingly  differentiated  food  produce.  With \\nincreasing  complexity  in  the  food  system,  a  greater  reliance  on  market  mechanisms  that \\nexploit the informational advantages of decentralized market participants has advantages over \\nstate intervention. This is because competitive forces can deliver efficient price discovery by \\nexploiting  local  and  idiosyncratic  information  (Hayek  1945)  and  by  giving  important \\nincentives \\u2013 for example through reputation \\u2013 that are necessary for the functioning of quality \\nassurance schemes.\\n6 At the same time, increasing complexity calls for a stricter separation of \\ntasks  between  markets  and  government  and  a  stronger  government  focus  on  auditing \\nmechanisms and liability law. \\n                                                 \\n4 In 2002, the sales of discounter Aldi alone grew by 16% (M+MEurodata 2003). \\n5 Organic share of total food production in 2000:  2.2% (Hamm, Gronefeld and Halpin 2002). \\n6 As we know from information economics, there is a role for government intervention, since Hayek\\u201fs (1945) \\nfundamental  insight  into  market  efficiency  only  holds  when  markets  operate  in  the  absence  of  imperfect \\ninformation.  A more refined argument would  also need to take account of trade and industrial organization \\nissues,  such  as  the  observed  increasing  concentration  in  the  German  food  industry.  These  issues  raise  new \\nconcerns related to multi-level governance. Issues related to credence attributes will be discussed below.  \\n  5 \\n \\nIndeed, we observe an increasing degree of government intervention along those dimensions \\nwhen  considering  the  food  safety  related  regulations  initiated  by  Mrs.  K\\u00fcnast,  or  EU \\ndirectives related to food safety.  To emphasize, such intervention can generally be justified, \\nsince it  is  well known that without intervention, a  market failure exists  in delivering the \\noptimal level of safety at the margin. The underlying problem of inadequate or asymmetric \\ninformation can not only be addressed through the regulation of liability, but also by public \\ninformation  provision,  and  through  the  mandatory  implementation  of  minimum  quality \\nstandards or guarantees.\\n7  \\n \\nThe case for  government intervention  with regards  to setting  minimum  product quality \\nstandards is a critical one in the context of this chapter.\\n8 In a world of increasing proliferation \\nof  brands  and  private  quality  assurance  systems,  the  problem  of  transparency  and \\nheterogeneity of product quality standards can  often be addressed more efficiently through  \\nmandated quality standards,  since  certified  quality  standards reduce information c ost to \\nconsumers about the safety level of quality attributes.  Importantly, product quality standards \\nrather than process quality standards enable the industry to choose the most efficient  method \\n                                                 \\n7 Evidence of this is found in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 which created the European Food Safety Authority \\nand established traceability at all stages in the food marketing chain. \\n8 Both extrinsic quality attributes (e.g. \\u201eQS label\\u201f) and intrinsic quality attributes (e.g. \\u201eorganic\\u201f) impact on the \\nquality perception of consumers. Intrinsic quality dimensions include therefore process attributes that are not \\nobservable at the point of purchase and may thus lead to market failure (even from ex post observations the \\nbuyer can never be certain of the quality of the services he purchased (Emons 1997)). The literature (Nelson \\n1970) has therefore differentiated credence attributes from experience attributes (whose utility is assessed after \\npurchase by actual consumption) and search attributes (which can be determined by inspection without the need \\nfor consumption).    \\n  6 \\nof achieving a given level of food safety.\\n9 In sum, since markets can help to resolve failures \\nrelated to food safety through competition and reputation, and since governments can take an \\nimportant role with regards to liability and information provision, a balanced, accountable and \\ntransparent division of responsibilities poses the greatest challenge to a government trying to \\nregain consumer confidence and assure an optimal degree of food safety at the margin.\\n10 \\n \\nThe following chapter aims to focus on the newly emerging mix of  market and government \\ninitiatives  in  Germany  with  regards to  food safety ,  as  exemplified by  an  industry  led, \\nvoluntary national quality assurance scheme (\\u201eQS\\u201f) and the reform of governance structures at \\nthe federal level. Following a discussion of the changing scope of governance with regards to \\nfood safety, the chapter discusses the effectiveness and efficiency of the emerging reform \\nelements of the new governance structures related to food safety. In doing so, this chapter \\ntries to answer to what extent food-safety related governance in Germany remains contested. \\nFinally, this chapter aims to provide an outlook on emerging tensions between governance \\nmodes,  since  these  tensions  are  likely  to  determine  the  accountability,  competence  and \\nefficiency of forthcoming food safety regulations. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n9 In this sense, the European Commission has opted for efficiency: the White Paper on Food safety promotes \\nfood safety standards and emphasizes that food safety is related to the attributes of the products, not to a specific \\nmethod of production. \\n10  Persson et al. (1997) make this call for accountability and transparency very clear in their analysis of political \\naccountability: \\u201cAnother relevant problem is how to increase the accountability and transparency of decisions in \\nthe European Union: witness the handling of the mad-cow disease by the European Commission.\\u201d (p.1199).  \\n  7 \\nThe Changing Scope of Governance \\n \\nGiven  the  federal  structure  and  the  institutions  that  are  associated  with  a  \\u201esocial  market \\neconomy\\u201f such as Germany, we expect that the underlying system of governance as related to \\nfood safety is distinctly different from other economies (Chandler 1990).\\n11 However, before \\nexploring several changes in  Germany\\u201fs  governance structure related to food safety, it is \\nessential to identify what is meant by scope of governance, governance structure and its role \\nin shaping an incentive structure that underlies economic activity and political distress. \\n \\nFollowing North (1990), Nelson and Sampat (2001) and vonTunzelmann (2003), the scope of \\ngovernance can be captured by three key elements: process, structure and control.  In the \\ncontext  of  this  chapter,  we  consider  governance  processes  as  the  changing  roles  and \\nrelationships  of  agents  and  agencies  in  the  course  of  the  BSE  events  in  Germany.\\n12 \\nGovernance  structure  relates  to  the  different  forms  through  which  decisions  are  made. \\nStructures can thus induce and govern collective decision making. Finally, the capability of \\ngovernance (competence) needs to be captured: control refers to the power to make economic \\nand policy decisions through different structures.  \\n \\nIn identifying the key parameters of regulatory organizations in OECD countries, Scott (2003) \\nsuggests that there are at least three main combinations of form and power: organizations \\n                                                 \\n11  Scholars  in  other  areas,  for  example  finance,  have  argued  that  we  can  distinguish  national  systems  of \\ngovernance, as defined by their methods of decision making and the underlying balance of power (Albert 1993). \\nConsider  also  that  Presidential  and  Parliamentary  democracies  involve  different  incentive  structures, \\ninformational asymmetries and thus scope for abuse of power (Persson, Roland and Tabellini 1997). \\n12 This is meant to include changes in information processes, such as changes in a newly regula ted information \\nexchange between local and federal ministries.  \\n  8 \\nestablished  and  given  power  by  statute;  organizations  established  without  direct  state \\ninvolvement,  through  contracts  or  incorporation,  but  empowered  by  state  legislative \\ninstruments; and non-state organizations exercising private regulatory power (p.309).\\n13 For \\nexample, consider  the contrast between  conventional modes of governance that rely on \\nlengthy legislative processes,  and more flexible governance modes such as  those that rely \\nmore heavily on regulatory agencies or voluntary standards (e.g. \\u201eQS\\u201f). Lengthy legislative \\nprocesses  are  more  vulnerable  to  political  and  lobbying  distress  due  to  their  structure  as \\ncompared to the more robust and flexible structure of regulatory agencies in a \\u201esocial market \\neconomy\\u201f, which are likely to undergo appropriate checks and balances.  They are, therefore, \\nmore likely to be accountable and democratically legitimate (Persson, Roland and Tabellini \\n1997). This is perhaps  where the economic view of scope of governance is echoed most \\nclosely  in  the  political  view  of  contested  governance,  in  terms  of  its  challenge  to  the \\nlegitimacy of existing institutional arrangements, and in terms of its sectoral or multi-sectoral \\nscope  (Ansell  and  Vogel,  this  volume).  Consider  that  the  \\u201enew  institutional  economics\\u201f \\nliterature refers to a governance structure as the institutional framework within which the \\nintegrity  of  a  transaction  is  decided  (Williamson  1979:  235).  The  elements  of  such  an \\ninstitutional framework, the institutions themselves, are the humanely devised constraints that \\nstructure political,  economic and social  interaction (North 1991:  97).  According to  North \\n(1991), these institutions consist of the informal constraints (sanctions, customs) and formal \\nrules (laws, property rights) that define part of the choice set of economic agents and thus \\ndetermine  the  profitability  and  feasibility  of  engaging  in  economic  activity  (p.97).  These \\n                                                 \\n13 \\u201cParadoxically the last of these is often the most independent and most powerful because of its capacity to \\ncombine  each  of  the  three  regulatory  functions  of  rule-making,  monitoring  and  enforcement,  without  the \\ninvolvement of any other organizations.\\u201d (Scott, 2003: 309).  \\n  9 \\ninformal constraints and formal rules lie at the heart of those conditions that either challenge \\nor support the legitimacy of existing institutional arrangements, and can therefore be directly \\nassociated with contested governance in the sense of Ansell and Vogel (this volume). \\n \\nGiven a mix of formal and informal constraints, the power of making economic and policy \\ndecisions through the above structures often fails to deliver equity and efficiency. We can \\nidentify  several  forms  of  failures  that  can  be  made  responsible  here:  market  failure, \\ngovernment failure, corporate failure and network failure. There are two reasons why these \\ndifferent modes of failures should not be considered in isolation in the context of our analysis, \\nFirst, we are interested in exploring changes in the scope of governance following the BSE \\noutbreak in Germany, as they relate to the changing scope of contestation. Consider that the \\ninterrelationship  between  different  modes  of  failure  can  directly  be  linked  to  the  BSE \\noutbreak  as  such.  Government  failure  exacerbated  market  failure  by  relying  on  non-\\ntransparent decision-making and thus hampering economic incentives. Due to inappropriate \\nliability  rules  at  the  farm  and  processing  level,  as  well  as  inadequate  and  asymmetric \\ninformation in the provision of ruminant feedstuff, a market failure emerged. But inadequate \\nliability at the level of public authorities and thus the failure to align incentives between \\nagents  in  the  political  hierarchies  were  also,  most  likely,  important  reasons  for  the  BSE \\noutbreak. As a further example, consider the UK where the specified bovine offal ban failed \\nfor at least two reasons. First, it failed because of the non-compliance of industry-participants. \\nSecond, it failed because government officials who were in charge of designing and enforcing \\nthe ruminant feed ban did not act in the interest of society. Government officials decided to \\nlower the temperature for treating animal protein in feedstuff processing, while their decision- \\n  10 \\nmaking process took place in the absence of public scrutiny.\\n14 Therefore the conditions that \\nled to the outbreak  of BSE may be regarded as a prime example for contested governance: \\nAnsell and Vogel (this volume) argue that contested governance is particularly likely where \\nintense public scrutiny confronts an extensively institutionalized policy sector in which day -\\nto-day  routine  decisions  are  delegated  to  experts  or  administrators  with  little  on -going \\nattention or interest from the public.   \\n \\nThe second and related reason that supports an analysis of the interrelationship between the \\nabove  modes of failure relates to   the  three  \\u201eideal\\u201f  types  of  governance  modes:  markets, \\nnetworks and hierarchies (Thompson, Frances,  Levacic and Mitchell 1991).\\n15 Importantly, \\ntwo types of hierarchies can be distinguished here, the corporate hierarchy (large firms), and a \\ncountry\\u201fs  political  hierarchies.\\n16  This division  between governance modes is  particularly \\nrelevant here, since this chapter argues that a transparent and sharp distinction between the \\nroles of markets and political hierarchies is desirable in resolving contested governance with \\nregards to food safety .  The following sections explore these issues more explicitly, by \\nanalyzing the key dimensions of changes in  the political hierarchies in Germany,  and by \\nexamining changes in a market-led initiative, both of which aim  to address contestation in \\nfood safety matters. \\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n14 Fox and Peterson (2004) also emphasize the importance of cross-contamination of feed, in mills and on farms, \\nwhich is difficult to detect because of lack of reliable tests. \\n15 \\u201cThe key feature of networks \\u2026 is the way cooperation and trust are formed and sustained within networks. In \\ncontrast to either hierarchy or market, networks coordinate through less formal, more egalitarian and cooperative \\nmeans.\\u201d Thompson, et al. (1991: 18). \\n16 See Libecap (1992) for early evidence of the interrelationship between these hierarchies, as they were shaping \\nthe first federal food quality guarantees in the US (1887-1891).  \\n  11 \\n \\nA Voluntary National Quality Assurance Scheme: \\u201cQuality and Safety\\u201d (QS) \\n \\nThe shift in incentives for the German food demand chain to implement a large scale quality \\nassurance  scheme  after  the  BSE  events  is  a  further  reflection  of  the  shifting  balance  of \\nregulation, away from publicly mandated food safety regulations, more towards industry-led \\ninitiatives.\\n17  Several authors have explored gene ral incentive and adoption issues   of such \\nquality assurance schemes at the industry level (Henson and Caswell 1999; Caswell, Bredahl \\nand Hooker 1998).\\n18 However, given the scope of this chapter, the following sections attempt \\nto describe the functioning of  the QS scheme, highlight its actual and potential weaknesses, \\nand  explore  its broader relevance in the context of German food safety regulation   and \\ncontested governance. \\n \\nThe following discussion focuses on the new \\u201eQS\\u201f scheme, mainly for three reasons. First, in \\ncontrast to the limited coverage of other retailer-led schemes, the QS scheme reaches across \\nthe entire demand chain for meat, meat produce as well as fruit and vegetables.\\n19 Second, it \\ntakes an interesting intermediate position in terms of incentive provision to the food demand \\nchain, as it combines elements of a voluntary  industry-led quality assurance scheme and a \\npublicly mandated set of food safety regulations. Third, largely due to the composition of it \\nmembers, the cautious criticism of Minister K\\u00fcnast (Die Zeit 2003; Agrar.de 2003), and a \\n                                                 \\n17  See  Fearne,  Hornibrook  and  Dedman  (2001)  for  previous  retailer-led  beef  quality  assurance  schemes  in \\nGermany. \\n18 Buzby, Frenzen and Rasco (2001) consider the adverse consequences on firms that may result from market \\nforces (reputation, market share, revenue), food safety regulations (penalties) and product liability law (legal and \\ncompensation expenses). \\n19 A quality management system is in place in the dairy industry. The objective of the dairy industry is to align it \\nwith the QS system.  \\n  12 \\nrecent BSE-test scandal (Putz 2004) QS has become a focus of public debate that longs to be \\nviewed through the lense of contested governance. \\n \\nIn October 2001, representatives from the German farmers\\u201f federation, the federations of feed \\nprocessors,  meat  processors  and  retailers  joined  together  with  the  Central  Marketing \\nAssociation of German Agriculture (\\u201eCMA\\u201f), to form a limited liability corporation with the \\nobjective of establishing a national label and quality assurance scheme for conventionally \\nproduced meat and meat produce.\\n20 Each of the federations has a veto right and sends two \\nrepresentatives to an \\u201eadvising committee\\u201f, whose task is twofold. First, it sets the control \\ncriteria according to which independent auditors are asked to classify and accredit system \\nparticipants.\\n21 Second, it defines and  interprets the criteria according to which the assigned \\nlabel is set up and communicated to the outside world.  \\n \\nTwo further institutions were established, t he  \\u201esanctioning  committee\\u201f  and  the  \\u201eboard  of \\ntrustees\\u201f. The sanctioning committee consists of three members, a lawyer, a judge and an \\nexpert sworn to impartiality. This  committee rules over system participants that have  not \\nadhered  to  the  control  criteria,  established  by  the  advising  committee.  The  sanctioning \\ncommittee  imposes  penalties  according  to  guidelines  that  are  established  by  the  advising \\ncommittee.  The  other  institution  is  the  board  of  trustees,  whose  functions  lie  in  public \\nrelations  and  advising  the  sanctioning  committee.\\n22  In  order  to  reduce  a  centralized \\nadministrative  burden,  key  demand  chain  members,  such  as  coopera tives,  packers  and \\n                                                 \\n20 Most of the following factual information originates from the official website of QS: www.q-s.info/de \\n21 Auditors operate according to DIN 45011. \\n22 The board of trustees consists of twelve members. It is made up of academics, politicians, a union \\nrepresentative, a member from the German consumer association and a representative from the sugar industry.  \\n  13 \\nslaughterhouses  have  become  the  \\u201elocal  administrative  centers\\u201f  for  producers,  who  then \\nbecome \\u201eassociated producers\\u201f.  \\n \\nThe structure of controls of system participants can be characterized in terms of three steps: \\nthe firm-level self-control, an independent auditing and a control of the auditing. Currently \\nthis  control  of the auditing is  performed by the QS  corporation itself, or by  independent \\nauditors that are chosen by QS. Independent auditing occurs randomly, but auditors have to \\nannounce their visit at least one week in advance. The auditors check on physical criteria such \\nas hygiene and administrative criteria such as documentation. Some criteria are exclusion \\ncriteria,  but  after  passing  those,  each  farm  obtains  an  index  number.  Depending  on  the \\npercentage of criteria fulfilled, farms get classified as QS-standard-1, 2 or 3. There are several \\nincentive problems with this system. First, it is not made public into which QS-standard a \\nsystem participant (and thus his product) has been classified. Second, the auditing frequency \\ndiffers according to specie (higher for beef than for pork) and level of system participant (key \\ndistinction between farmers and \\u201elocal administrative centers\\u201f). For example, a pork producer \\nwho has been classified into QS-standard 1 has three years before he can expect the next \\nauditor on his farm (two years for QS-standard 2, and one year for QS-standard 3). Third, the \\nauditing frequency and stringency is particularly low at the retail level. As soon as more than \\n10 percent of retail outlets in a given chain have achieved a given QS-standard, this QS-\\nstandard will automatically be granted to all the remaining outlets. Once a retail chain has \\nbeen  granted QS-standard 1,  only 10  percent  of its  outlets  will be randomly selected for \\nauditing (15 percent annually for QS-standard 2 and 20 percent annually for QS-standard 3).   \\n  \\n  14 \\nGiven the inexperience with this type of quality assurance scheme, it is of interest to examine \\nthe practical implications for the alliance members further. Beyond the mandatory federal \\nrequirements in terms of documentation of origin and medication, the use of antibiotics is \\nmore strictly regulated under QS. Growth antibiotics were permitted for the production of \\npiglets and in the early fattening stages of pork production until January 2004. A total ban on \\ngrowth  antibiotics  has  since  been  implemented  throughout  the  lifecycle  of  all  animals. \\nHowever, the use of GM feedstuff as well as the use of fully slatted floors in pork production \\nis still permitted (Putz 2004). Another important implication for farmers is the compulsory \\nmonitoring of their salmonella status, exceeding the general mandatory federal regulations. \\nThe data about the salmonella status of an individual animal as well as a classification of the \\nentire  farm  is  fed  into  a  central  Salmonella  data  base.  From  there,  farmers  and \\nslaughterhouses can access the data. Initially sow herds were exempt so the coverage of the \\nSalmonella monitoring was incomplete until January 2004. \\n \\nTo emphasize, there are no implications and specifications at the farmgate or any other level \\nregarding  GMO\\u201fs  or  animal  welfare  criteria.  As  slaughterhouses,  processors  and  retailers \\nalready have to comply with federal regulation regarding traceability, there is no additional \\nimpact from QS.  \\n \\nSince the initiation of the QS system, the first certified produce appeared on the markets in \\nSeptember 2002, while the first meat under the new QS-label was sold by Walmart. Clearly, \\nthat was a message to all those who believed that QS would automatically guarantee higher \\nretail and producer prices.   \\n  15 \\n \\nHowever, for the first time in German history, a voluntary national quality assurance scheme \\nwas established. Since regulators are interested in the efficient provision of a desired level of \\nfood safety, this should be seen in a positive light as we need to consider economies of scale \\nassociated  with  safety-specific  capital.\\n23  With  QS,  as  with  other  schemes  of  vertical \\nintegration,  firms  can  obtain   the  necessary  minimum  efficient  scale  of  production . \\nNevertheless, QS has only achieved a limited coverage of the entire sector  with about  50 \\npercent of pork and 32 percent of beef produced under the QS label (October 2003). This is \\nsurprisingly low, given that QS originated as a result of safety problems in the beef sector. \\nBeginning  in early  2004  QS  auditing  had  also  started  in the fruit and vegetable sector . \\nFurthermore, system participants hope that QS will improve international competitiveness of \\nQS certified fruits and vegetables, since QS audits will be embedded in the global system of \\nEUREPGAP audits.\\n24 \\n \\nWith  the key objective of establishing a quality assurance scheme   that covers the entire \\nvertical supply chain based on HACCP principles, the QS scheme has achieved  standards \\nonly  slightly  greater  than  Germany\\u201fs  mandatory  standards:  its  criteria  rest  generally  on \\nexisting  mandatory  standards  and  are  only  distinct  in  terms  of  a  more  extensive  data \\nmanagement  system  (which  is  meant  to  improve  traceability)  and  increased  Salmonella \\n                                                 \\n23 This point deserves further emphasis since German meat production, particularly in pork, is characterized by \\nmuch smaller production units as compared to other European partners. Given the lack of large, homogenous \\nsupplies, this is likely to lead to further competitive pressure, as German processors and retailers are likely to \\nlook beyond the German border as soon as others have adopted QS standards. \\n24  Key specifics of EUREPGAP are: transparency, recognition of existing schemes and programmes v ia \\nBenchmarking and an easy to adopt Good Agricultural Practice protocol that is based on a master HACCP plan \\n(no full HACCP excersise at the farm gate).  \\n  16 \\nmonitoring. Along those criteria, QS fulfills the EU Food Safety Law 178/2002 in terms of \\ntraceability and self control. \\n \\nIn sum, what are the most critical points of the QS system? Given its limited coverage in \\nterms of total production, it appears that the system\\u201fs credibility remains limited as long as \\nthere is leeway for members of the supply chain to circumvent the system. More strikingly, \\nthe very reason for establishing the QS label does not appear to be taken seriously: according \\nto \\u201eFoodwatch\\u201f, an independently funded German organization for consumer's rights in the \\nfield of agricultural and food policy, nine German farms were identified where QS certified \\nbeef was not tested for BSE (Putz 2004). Furthermore, considering the institutional structure \\nof the QS system, the role of the \\u201esanctioning committee\\u201f appears questionable in two points. \\nFirst,  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  emerges  since  the  sanctioning  committee  imposes \\nsanctions according to guidelines that were established by the advising committee. Second, \\nand most importantly in the view of the declared objective of improving transparency, those \\nsystem members that violated the QS criteria and were punished with sanctions are not made \\npublic. Further, the lack of transparency with regards to the system participants\\u201f classification \\ninto QS-standards, and the low auditing frequency deserve to be emphasized again. Also, the \\nSalmonella  monitoring  scheme  is  insufficiently  rigorous,  as  there  are  no  bacteriological \\nexaminations  of  the  animals  required.\\n25  Problems  with  establishing  a  more  rigorous \\nSalmonella  monitoring  scheme  can  only  be  anticipated  from  the  fact  that  the  German \\ngovernment had previously led a voluntary national eradication and disease control program, \\nwhich was abandoned by the end of 1999 due to lack of participation. \\n                                                 \\n25 No judgement can be made regarding the actual status of infection; it is merely possible to judge whether an \\nanimal had contact with Salmonella in the past.  \\n  17 \\n \\nSome critical issues extend further to the butchers and the retailers. The butchers\\u201f association \\nhas refused to join the label, based on two points. First, butchers argue that the additional \\ncompliance costs will not be counterbalanced by a higher consumers\\u201f willingness to pay. \\nSecond, the butchers believe that  their quality standards  are already  above QS  standards. \\nResults from a recent study (Loy and Steiner 2004) suggest that butchers have indeed been \\nable  to  charge  higher  prices  as  compared  to  supermarkets.\\n26  As  several  studies  have \\nconfirmed, German consumers appear to value the \\u201epersonal relationship\\u201f with a butcher more \\nthan placing their trust in an \\u201eanonymous label\\u201f (Nielsen 1998; Wirz 1996). The fact that \\nbutchers have not joined the QS system, although they currently account for about 40 percent \\nof meat sales in Germany, could therefore be regarded as a further indication of the inability \\nof the QS corporation to communicate the label\\u201fs benefits to consumers, beyond those that are \\nconveyed through the current mandatory standards.  \\n \\nFurther, consider the retail level. The QS scheme started as a retailer-led quality assurance \\nscheme, with its first meat being sold through Walmart. Many producers and food processors \\nwere thus  implicitly forced to  adopt QS  standards,  or lose their outlets. Clearly, with an \\nincreasing concentration at the retail level, it is important to keep antitrust issues in mind. \\n \\nIn total, and accounting for the now tightened standards as compared to the initialization \\nstage, QS appears to have slightly lifted the overall level of food safety beyond the current \\nmandatory state regulations. However, it appears striking that a quality assurance scheme was \\n                                                 \\n26 Also, in the wake of the 1996 BSE crisis in Germany, they appear to have been able to adopt a more consistent \\npricing strategy, as reflected in a lower price variability (Loy and Steiner 2004).  \\n  18 \\nput into place with little rigor first, before more stringent measures were adopted. This may be \\nrational with regards to minimizing system participants\\u201f initial compliance costs. But it is \\nunlikely to be a successful long-term strategy with regards to regaining consumer confidence \\nand market share. Consider that at present, the QS label appears to carry a low informational \\nvalue, since it is difficult to communicate to consumers the differences between the QS label \\nand the required standards objectively. Beyond the complexity of the underlying standards, a \\nlow consumer valuation is also anticipated due to a continuing lack of consumer trust. This is \\nnot only due to the fact that most of the information about QS originates from its system \\nmembers,  but  also  because  German  consumers  continue  to  be  surprised  by  undesirable \\nsubstances  in  the  food  demand  chain  (May  2002:  Nitrofen  in  organic  wheat,  July  2003: \\nDioxin in feedstuff).  \\n \\nNevertheless, due to its broader scope and larger scale than previous small-scale industry-led \\nquality  assurance  schemes,  the  implicitly  improved  standard  harmonization  could,  in \\nprinciple, be seen in a positive light for consumers. Consumer choice could be improved due \\nto the reduction in the complexity of labeling and standards information.  However, due to the \\ngreater  comparability  of  standards,  transparency  is  likely  to  lead  to  greater  competitive \\npressure on other sector participants to differentiate themselves. A continuing proliferation of \\ndomestic  and  international  retailer  or  producer  led  quality  assurance  schemes  could  be \\nexpected to appear on the German market in the future. Consumer gains could thus be with \\nregards to price, but whether consumers gain in terms of information provision is likely to be  \\n  19 \\ndetermined by how industry players and the government find a balance between standards \\nregulation and label proliferation.\\n27 \\n \\nFurther, since  QS system participants have developed the Salmonella monitoring system  \\nbased on the European Parliament\\u201fs regulation on the control of Salmonella, QS is likely to \\nserve  as  basis  for  a  faster  and  more  efficient  introduction  of  the  expected  mandatory \\nregulation.\\n28 In future, it  should also guarantee a smoother compliance with the proposed \\nEuropean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)  (COM 2003/0174, 16.9.2003). \\nBeyond the Salmonella criteria in QS, it is also the establishment of a central Salmonella data \\nbase that anticipates forthcoming EU regulation with regards to traceability, and should thus \\nbee  seen  in  a  positive  light .\\n29  Given  these  potential  harmonization  benefits,  i t  will  be \\ninteresting to continue to observe the forthcoming governance interplay between political and \\ncorporate hierarchies, especially after the recent reform of federal ministries and regulations \\nin Germany. \\n \\nThe Reform of Food Safety Regulation in Germany \\n \\nThe most visible change in governance that can be associated with food safety issues relates \\nto the renaming of the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry to the Federal \\nMinistry of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture (BMVEL) in January 2001. This \\n                                                 \\n27 Consider also that the German government does not intend to replace QS by any national set of regulations \\n(BMVEL 2003). \\n28 See directive 2001/0176 (COD) and 2001/0177 (COD), as in COM(2003) 434, 16.7.2003. \\n29 EU Food Safety Law 178/2002 has taken effect on the 1st January 2005.  \\n  20 \\noccurred  only  one  day  after  the  federal  minister  for  health  and  the  federal  minister  for \\nagriculture were forced to resign. \\n \\nThe  following  section  outlines  the  changes  in  governance  structure  before  attempting  an \\nassessment of these reforms. Throughout, this section will relate to a study of the German \\ncourt of auditors, which was initiated by Chancellor Schr\\u00f6der at the end of 2000 (\\u201evon Wedel \\nreport\\u201f;  von  Wedel  2001).  This  127  page  report,  which  was  published  in  July  2001,  is \\nparticularly insightful for two reasons. First, its editor was the president of the German federal \\ncourt of auditors and, at the same time, the federal commissioner for operating efficiency in \\npublic administration.\\n30 Second, the report came about with the cooperation of experts of the \\ncourt  of  auditors ,  the  BMVEL,  as  well  as  an  advising  committee  that  consisted  of \\nrepresentatives from farmers, consumers groups and science. \\n \\nThe re-naming of the ministry into the BMVEL had an i mmediate structural consequence. \\nThe Federal Ministry for Consumer Protection (BgVV) was placed under the jurisdiction of \\nthe BMVEL and finally dissolved in November 2002. The BgVV\\u201fs responsibilities were then \\ntaken over by three federal institutions: The BMVEL, the newly created federal institute of \\nrisk assessment (BfR) and the newly created federal office for consumer protection and food \\nsafety (BVL), both of which were created in November 2002. As will be discussed in more \\ndetail below, the BfR is responsible for risk analysis, risk communication to policy makers \\nand  the  public,  and  cooperation  with  the  European  Food  Safety  Authority  (EFSA) \\n(Agrarbericht 2003). Risk management responsibilities (including the admission of pesticides) \\n                                                 \\n30 Since January 2002 Dr. von Wedel is member of the European court of auditors.  \\n  21 \\nand the coordination of joint control functions between the Federation and the federal states \\nwere taken over by the BVL. The reform of these institutions has very much followed the \\nblueprint of the von Wedel report.\\n31 \\n \\nThe report\\u201fs criticism focuses on three traits of the previous scope of governance. These are \\nthe fragmentation of food safety related responsibilities across Federal ministries, the lack of \\nan independent scientific center advising the BMVEL, and the lack of coordination between \\nthe Federation, the federal states and the EU in matters of food safety. \\n \\nFragmentation of responsibilities \\n \\nAfter the immediate reorganization of the BMVEL in January 2000 there were still food \\nsafety  related  tasks  for  which  the  BMU  (Federal  Ministry  for  the  environment,  nature \\nconservation  and  nuclear  safety),  the  BMWI  (Federal  ministry  for  the  economy  and \\ntechnology) and the BMG (Federal Ministry of Health) were responsible. The von Wedel \\nreport found that there were eighteen subordinate Federal institutes engaged in food safety \\nmatters. In order to address this fragmentation, lack of coordination and in response to the \\nChancellor\\u201fs intention that food safety matters should be concentrated within the BMVEL, the \\nreport contained two main suggestions. First, food safety tasks should be bundled within the \\nBMVEL after a reorganized working structure of its departments. Second, a complete reform \\nof  the  central  policy  department  within  the  BMVEL  was  proposed  to  account  for  future \\nstrategic issues such as policy planning, coordination in research, and coordination in EU \\n                                                 \\n31 Following the von Wedel report, a working group on the \\u201ereorganization of consumer health protection\\u201f was \\nconvened in the BMVEL and published its findings and proposals in December 2001 (BMVEL 2001).  \\n  22 \\nmatters. While the bundling of food safety responsibilities has taken shape in the current \\nBMVEL, the second proposal of the von Wedel report has not yet been implemented. \\n \\nEstablishment of an independent scientific center for risk analysis \\n \\nWithin the structure of the previously established Federal ministries, there was no scope for \\ninterdisciplinary risk analysis related to food safety. Therefore the von Wedel report proposed \\nthe establishment of such a center with the following tasks: (1) collect, analyze and evaluate \\ninformation on food risk (risk analysis and risk communication) in order to provide \\u201eobjective \\nand  preventative  policy  advice\\u201f,  (2)  serve  as  an  intermediary  between  the  BMVEL  and \\nnational and international research institutes, (3) serve as representative vis a vis the European \\nFood  Safety  Authority  (EFSA).  The  report  recommended  that  this  center  be  part  of  the \\nBMVEL (in budgetary terms, with an independent governing status), that it have the power to \\ncontract research projects out, and guaranteed independence through similar principles and \\nmeasures that rule for the Deutsche Bundesbank. Given the unresolved budgetary issue and \\nfaced with the difficult task of overcoming principal-agent (incentive) problems that would \\nunderlie such an \\u201eassociated center\\u201f, it is not surprising that this part of the proposal has not \\nbeen put into practice in its original form.  \\n \\nThe Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) in its current form considers itself as the \\nscientific body of the Federal Republic of Germany in matters of food safety. It has the legal \\nform of a self-governing public institution, which is meant to provide the necessary scientific \\nindependence. The BfR aims to prepare expert reports and opinions on questions of food  \\n  23 \\nsafety and consumer health protection on the basis of internationally recognized scientific \\nassessment criteria (BfR 2003). With the help of risk analyses, the BfR aims to formulate \\naction options for risk reduction. The tasks of the BfR include the provision of scientific \\nadvice to federal ministries concerned with food safety matters, and the publication of original \\nresearch and risk assessments to the public, in a transparent and comprehensible manner.\\n32 \\nFurther, the BfR is engaged in scientific cooperation with other international institutions and \\norganizations that are involved in consumer health protection and food safety. The BfR takes \\na role which more closely resembles that of AFSSA in F rance (see Besan\\u00e7on et al., this \\nvolume), since its role as a public body for risk assessment is strictly separated from risk \\nmanagement. This contrasts with the UK reforms, where risk assessment, management and \\ncommunication functions are combined within the FSA (see Rothstein, this volume). \\n \\nAddressing the lack of coordination at the national and EU level \\n \\nIn anticipation of the foundation of the EFSA, the von Wedel report focused on organizational \\nweaknesses at the level of the Federation as well as on the division of responsibilities between \\nfederal states and the Federation. In the past, the Federation was only partly responsible with \\nregards to food safety matters. The responsibility was limited to the creation of laws at the \\nlevel of the federation, as well as to cooperating responsibilities with EU institutions. Given \\nGermany\\u201fs constitution, the central role of the federal states was and still is in the sphere of \\nexecution (monitoring food quality, feedstuff and the private veterinary sector). In order to \\nfulfill the joint tasks of the Federation and the federal states in terms of risk management, risk \\n                                                 \\n32 \\u201cThe assessment results will, in principle, be made publicly accessible whilst maintaining the confidentiality \\nof protected data.\\u201d BfR (2003).  \\n  24 \\nevaluation and risk communication, the von Wedel report suggested the creation of a more \\noutput-oriented \\u201ecoordinating agency of the Federation\\u201f (KSB).  Created in  its  governance \\nstructure  as  a  mirror  image  to  EU  governance  structures,  this  KSB  has  been  established \\nthrough  the  BVL  (federal  office  for  consumer  protection  and  food  safety).  Its  associated \\nresponsibilities lie in  the establishment  of a central  internal  data network  for food safety \\nissues and harmonization of control standards and crisis management, such that the KSB \\nfunctions as intercept for the European Rapid Alert System. However, two very appropriate \\nrecommendations  of the  von Wedel  report have not  been followed so  far  - that the data \\ncollected through the KSB be made public and that the KSB be used as a mechanism for \\nexploring the legal appropriateness of existing liability laws.\\n 33 \\n \\nBeyond the reform of the BMVEL and its related institutions, the Government has enacted \\nseveral other initiatives. On August 6, 2002, a law for the \\u201enew organization of consumer \\nhealth protection and food safety\\u201f was passed in the upper house of the federal government. \\nThis legislation establishes the BfR and the BVL and re-labels the pesticide regulation, the \\nepidemic regulation and the feedstuff regulation to conform with the newly labeled BMVEL. \\nIn 2003, the government has also invested about $13 million Dollars to support the national \\nresearch initiative on TSE (Transmissible spongiforme Enzephalopathien). In addition, the \\ngovernment has reformed liability laws by integrating consumer rights into the BGB (the \\nGerman civil code), making it easier for consumers to sue individual firms, and for consumer \\ngroups to sue associations. \\n                                                 \\n33 \\u201eIm Auftrag des Bundesministeriums f\\u00fcr Verbraucherschutz in Bonn ist zwar eine ganze Abteilung damit \\nbesch\\u00e4ftigt, herauszufinden, wann wo welches Tier erkrankte und womit es gef\\u00fcttert wurde.

This chapter suggests that the \\nlack of the following governance traits as related to food safety can be used to reflect upon \\nthis issue: \\n \\nCompetence\\n35 \\n \\n\\uf0b7  the capacity to select and replace ill-founded food safety policy instruments \\n\\uf0b7  the capacity to design and implement well-founded food safety policy instruments \\n(e.g. the capacity to judge whether risk is acceptable or not) \\n                                                 \\n34  \\u201cDer  BSE-Skandal  markiert  das  Ende  der  Landwirtschaftspolitik  alten  Typs.

It \\nappears that the reduction in fragmentation of food safety related responsibilities through the \\nestablishment  of  the  BMVEL  in  its  current  form  has  led  to  a  more  competent  scope  of \\ngovernance. \\n \\nFurther,  with  the  established  separation  of  risk  management  from  risk  analysis  and  risk \\ncommunication through the BfR and BVL (which mirrors European governance structures as \\nimplemented  in  the  EU  Food  Safety  Law  178/2002),  accountability  has  also  been,  in \\nprincipal, improved.  \\n  \\n  27 \\nRegarding transparency, this chapter has stressed the lack of it on several occasions above, \\nincluding in the context of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). This may prove to \\nbe  the  greatest  weakness  in  terms  of  improving  the  food  industry\\u201fs  and  government\\u201fs \\naccountability.  \\n \\nIn  sum,  it  appears  that  contestation  in  food  safety  matters  has  been  reduced  today  when \\njudged  in  terms  of  competence  and  accountability.  Initially,  and  following  the  decree  of \\nChancellor  Schr\\u00f6der  for  organizational  reform  in  January  2001,  a  mere  re-bundling  of \\nresponsibilities  has  been  observed,  without  effective  reform  efforts  related  to  food  safety \\nissues.\\n36 Largely due to the von Wedel report, which was initiated by the Chancellor himself, \\nthis temporary peak in  politicization has subdued. However, only the  emergence of critical \\nsafety situations will prove how accountable and competent the governance structure  will \\nremain.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n36  \\u201cEs  unterblieb  eine  umfassende  interne  Reorganisation,  mit  der  Anliegen  des  gesundheitlichen \\nVerbraucherschutzes entsprechend ihrer politischen Bedeutung geb\\u00fcndelt worden w\\u00e4ren.\\u201c (von Wedel, 2001: \\n27).  \\n  28 \\nEffectiveness and efficiency in a changing scope of governance \\n \\nThe following section attempts a brief assessment of effectiveness and allocative efficiency as \\nit relates to the current scope of governance in food safety matters.  \\n \\nEffectiveness \\nIn  order  to  consider  the  effectiveness  of  the  reformed  institutions  more  explicitly,  the \\nfollowing criteria are employed: \\n \\n(i)  achievement of goals inherent in the implemented regulations and policies \\n(ii)  appropriateness of regulatory burden in its context \\n(iii) facilitation of verification and traceability  \\n(iv)   strengthening of liability law \\n \\n(i) The von Wedel report has established the fragmentation of the old Ministry of Agriculture \\nas one of the main deficiencies to be resolved. Since the goals of the report were, in this \\nrespect, put largely into practice, it appears that the current governance structure represents a \\nmajor \\u2013 though overdue \\u2013 improvement. However, without knowledge of the time allocation \\nof individual ministries and branches on food safety related aspects and the corresponding \\nachievement of specific goals, it is difficult to provide further judgement. \\n \\n(ii) Given the bundling of responsibilities and the reduction in fragmentation, the regulatory \\nburden through multiple and overlapping governance structures is likely to be reduced. The  \\n  29 \\nestablishment  of  the  BfR  is  important  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of  food  safety \\nregulations through conducting and promoting research in general, and through the use of \\ncost-benefit analysis in particular. Since it is currently unknown to what extent the BfR uses \\ncost-benefit analyses in the regulatory process (no such information has been made public on \\ntheir website until June 2005), only the observed promotion of research and the associated \\nestablishment of a data network hints to an improvement in terms of regulatory effectiveness. \\nNevertheless, the above caveat in terms of lacking data transparency looms large.  \\n \\n(iii) The government\\u201fs attempt to establish a voluntary Salmonella monitoring scheme that \\nensures  traceability  and  facilitates  verification  has  failed.  Instead,  traceability  has  been \\nachieved through the QS\\u201fs Salmonella monitoring and the central Salmonella data base. \\n \\n(iv) Finally, with regards to producers, consumers and consumer groups, liability rules have \\nbeen improved.  \\n \\nEfficiency \\n \\nEfficient governance mechanisms are those which align incentive problems between agents \\nthat  frequently  occur  due  to  the  separation  of  ownership  and  control  (Williamson  1998). \\n\\u201eGood governance\\u201f aims thus to align incentive problems in order to permit the realization of \\n(mutual) gains between agents. There are several ways by which the achievement of such \\ngains  may  be  hampered.  In  the  face  of  the  previously  discussed  changes  in  scope  of \\ngovernance, this section will briefly focus on issues of authority, liability and risk.   \\n  30 \\n \\nAuthority, decentralization and efficiency \\n \\nAs Aghion and Tirole (1997) emphasize, a gain in terms of efficiency can be made by giving \\nup  some  control,  i.e.  giving  away  real  authority,  although  formal  control  remains  top \\npriority.\\n37 Considering the stricter bundling of food safety related tasks at the Federal level, \\nthe improved communication between Federal ministries due to the reduction in overlap of \\nresponsibilities, together with a more transparent decentralized federal governance structure, \\nit is likely that the current governance structure is more efficient than previous ones. \\n \\nLiability and the provision of information \\n \\nFrom an efficiency point of view, it is desirable to use food safety regulation and liability \\nrules jointly in order to control for risk related to food safety hazards (Shavell 1984; Skogh \\n1989;  Antle  1995).\\n38  Although  an  improved  regulation  of  the  provision  of  risk -related \\ninformation helps to assure and preserve consumers\\u201f freedom of choice, informational failures \\nneed to be addressed through standards and liability.\\n39  Since 2001 we observe tighter liability \\nrules that should strengthen deterrence. Together with an improvement of risk assessment, \\ncommunication and management that appears to have been made (through the establishment \\nof the BfR and the BVL), it is likely that the balance between regulation and liability has been \\n                                                 \\n37 Aghion and Tirole (1997) focus on a moral hazard setting (agents can take actions that are unobserved to \\nothers) with costly monitoring, which appears most suited in the present context. \\n38 When it is inefficient to address market failures through tort liability, there is need for regulation. \\n39 Issues related to inadequate and asymmetric information (credence qualities) have been discussed above. \\nLiability can be shared, in a hierarchy, or it can be shifted among agents, each of which has different efficiency \\nimplications. Sunding and Zilberman (1998) analyze the case of shifting liability among firms and consumers, \\nwhen agents follow what are perceived to be reasonable actions that result in accidental injury.   \\n  31 \\nimproved.\\n40  So far,  considering information made public through the internet,   it is not \\napparent that much risk-related research has been performed in relation to food safety matters. \\nIt appears that, in striving for more efficient risk regulation, the BfR should address important \\nissues,  such  as:  how  do  consumers  respond  to  different  communication  efforts  of  the \\ngovernment,  and how  does  consumers\\u201f  capacity  to  use  differently  formatted  information \\nvary?\\n41  \\n \\nIn sum, the reformed food safety regulation appears suited to improve efficiency through the \\nemphasis on information provision, standards and  transparency, as these help to safeguard \\nconsumers\\u201f freedom of choice.\\n42 Since we observe some improvements in liability law and \\nstandards  regulation,  and  would  expect  that  fewer  resources  are  needed  to  achieve  the \\nacclaimed  risk-related  goals  in  the newly reformed governance  structure, efficiency  gains \\nshould be observed. Nevertheless, the lack of deterrence due to the reduction in potential \\nliability that comes with the limited publication of risk data is likely to hamper efficiency (it is \\nalso in this sense that QS is inefficient by not publishing firms that defected). \\n \\n                                                 \\n40  With  \\u201etightened\\u201f  liability  it  will  be  more  feasible  to  sue  with  lower  transaction  costs.  Further,  the  legal \\ninstruments will be more suited to provide deterrence, assuming that firms correctly anticipate the compensation \\nwhich would be imposed by the legal rules (Viscusi, 1989a). An improvement of liability rules along those lines \\nwill, through the reduction of transaction costs, help to ensure that a level of food safety is provided that is \\nsocially optimal. Consider that lower transaction costs may also be achieved through the court system itself, due \\nto clearer liability rulings. \\n41  Viscusi and Magat (1992) discuss the conditions under which different types of information provision \\ninstruments are effective. Just, Wolf, Wu and Zilberman (2002) extend existing models of value of information \\nby incorporating consideration of individu als\\u201f varying capacity to use differently formatted information and \\nvariation in their information needs. \\n42 The current refusal of the QS system to make the Salmonella status public could also be seen in this light: if \\nthe  Salmonella  status  is  disclosed,  co nsumers  could  overestimate  the  uncertain  outcome  of  contracting \\nSalmonellosis with a certain probability. The level of meat demand would thus be suboptimal. However, a \\ntransparent system means also that scientists and the media have a role in transmitting  the information to \\nconsumers such that these market failures can be averted.  \\n  32 \\nRisk standards, cost-benefit analysis and the issue of risk perception \\n \\nWhen risk standards (standards to protect health) are used for choosing between different food \\nsafety regulations, a major concern is that the costs of different policy options may not enter \\ninto the design of risk standards, and standard setting is likely to reflect evidence of risk \\nbiases and responsiveness to political factors (Viscusi and Hamilton 1999). This calls for the \\nuse of cost-benefit analysis. Furthermore, since governance decisions at the federal level need \\nto account for private efforts to ensure food safety (QS), cost-benefit analysis should be used \\nto facilitate the identification of effective intervention points in the food demand chain, and \\nthe identification of efficient mixes of mandatory and voluntary quality management systems \\n(Unnevehr and Roberts 1997; Caswell 1998).\\n43 The general importance and pitfalls of cost-\\nbenefit analysis for regulatory decision making are well established (Nichols 1991; Arrow, et \\nal. 1996). But importantly with regards to food safety, s tandard cost-benefit has also been \\nrefined to take account of scientific uncertainty, in ways that balance the Precautionary \\nPrinciple against the benefits of waiting  to learn before taking action (Gollier 2001).\\n44 This \\nraises three issues related to the legitimacy of the BfR, the BVL and the governance reforms \\nas such. First, since it is unknown, at this stage, to what extent the BfR makes use of cost -\\nbenefit analyses, it is difficult to judge how efficient the operations of the BfR and BVL are \\nalong these lines (there are no publications that reveal its actual use, although the BfR \\nproclaims  that  it  is  \\u201edeveloping  concepts\\u201f  for  cost-benefit  analysis).  Second,  from  the \\npublished information it is not known to what extent the Precautionary Principle is actually \\n                                                 \\n43 See Unnevehr and Roberts (1997) for a discussion of cost-benefit analysis in the context of microbial food \\nsafety.  \\n44 The Precautionary Principle asserts that uncertainty should never be used as a reason for postponing risk-\\nprevention efforts (Gollier 2001).  \\n  33 \\nintegrated into cost-benefit research at the BfR. Third, even if this done, it is not evident what \\nrole  the  Precautionary  Principle  takes  as  part  of  the  reformed  food  safety  regulations. \\nHowever,  in  providing  reformed  institutional  arrangements  that  reduce  distrust  in  public \\nauthority and thus reduce challenges to legitimacy, the specification of a clear and transparent \\nrole of the Precautionary Principle in a newly emerging scope of governance should be given \\na high priority. \\n \\nGiven  consumers\\u201f  different  capacity  and  thus  efficiency  of  using  various  forms  of \\ninformation, it is to be expected that consumer heterogeneity will pose further challenges to \\nthe  work  of  the  BfR  and  the  BVL.\\n45  Since German consumers have proved to be more \\nsensitive  than other  European  consumers  with  regards to  food  safety   scandals  and  the \\nprovision of food safety information, consumer heterogeneity and  the resulting problem of \\nefficient allocation of risks should be part of the BfR\\u201fs research agenda. An interdisciplinary \\nresearch effort appears particularly appropriate, just as the von Wedel report has suggested, \\nsince this is likely to help in analyses to adjust the subjective risk to the objective one.\\n46 \\nFuture research could control for these aspects by taking advantage of the strengths of choice \\nexperiments from surveys, combining it with market data (Louviere  et al.1999; Louviere, \\nHensher and Swait 2000). \\n \\nIn sum, risk research should not degenerate to a governance marketing effort that aims at \\nreducing perceived risk associated with search, experience and credence attributes. Rather, a \\n                                                 \\n45 It is well known that it is important to account for the endogeneity of risk: consumers differ in their marginal \\nproductivity of self-protection (Ehrlich and Becker 1972; Shogren and Crocker 1999).  \\n46 See Viscusi (1989b) for analyses that account explicitly for the relationship between consumers\\u201f perception of \\nrisk and actual risk.  \\n  34 \\nmultidisciplinary research effort on risk perception is important for an efficient design of \\ngovernance  structures  and  a  regaining  of  institutional  legitimacy,  since  knowledge  of \\nperceived risk helps to rationalize and de-politicize risk assessment and those governance \\noptions which both the BfR and BVL have on their agenda. In doing this, those interested in \\neffectiveness and efficiency of the evolving scope of governance in Germany may wish to \\nconsider Viscusi\\u201fs findings as their paradigm: \\n \\nAs in the case of risk perception biases, the most disturbing aspect \\nof these potential market failures is that the government policies \\nintended to eliminate the shortcomings often appear to be driven \\nby the same set of influences.\\u201d (Kip Viscusi, 1990: 261) \\n \\n \\nConclusion \\n \\nSix weeks  after the  first  BSE case emerged in Germany the foundations  were laid  for  a \\nsweeping  reform  of  governance  structures  related  to  food  safety:  within  48  hrs  both  the \\nminister of health and the minister of agriculture were forced to resign, and a lawyer and \\nmember of the green party became head of the former Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture \\nand Forestry.  The ministry was simultaneously re-named the Federal Ministry of Consumer \\nProtection, Food and Agriculture. This chapter has tried to explore an emerging mix of market \\nand government initiatives in Germany with regards to food safety, as exemplified by an \\nindustry led, voluntary national quality assurance scheme (\\u201cQuality and Safety\\u201d, \\u201eQS\\u201f) and  \\n  35 \\nthe reform of federal level governance structures involved in food safety issues. Since both \\nmandatory regulations and markets, through reputation and competition, can serve to provide \\nappropriate incentives and constraints with regards to food safety matters to actors in the food \\nindustry, the functioning and implications of QS were considered together with the reforms of \\ngovernance structures at the ministerial level. \\n \\nBefore the actual changes in the different aspects of governance were discussed, an attempt \\nwas made to explore the key elements of scope of governance, i.e. structure, control and \\nprocess, together with the evolving mix of types of governance modes in a more general \\ncontext. This permits a clearer assessment of governance elements that follows with regards \\nto aspects of competence, accountability, effectiveness and efficiency. In turn, it enables us to \\nexplore the extent to which the changing scope of governance faces ongoing public distrust \\nthat challenges the legitimacy of those newly reformed institutional arrangements (Ansell and \\nVogel, this volume). \\n \\nFollowing a review of the QS scheme, it appears that the initiative has lifted the overall level \\nof food safety only slightly above the one supplied by the current mandatory state regulations. \\nThis is largely due to an attempt to implement a more rigorous Salmonella monitoring system \\nand the need to satisfy all members of the demand chain that participate in the QS system. A \\nlow informational value of the label is asserted, also since it is difficult to communicate to \\nconsumers  the  differences  between  the  QS  label  and  the  generally  required  mandatory \\nstandards  objectively.  But  beyond  the  complexity  of  the  underlying  standards,  a  low \\nconsumer valuation is also expected due to a continuing lack of consumer trust. Public distrust  \\n  36 \\nhas only recently received a boost due to allegations of failures in BSE testing (Putz 2004). \\nHowever, given the broader scope and larger scale of the QS scheme compared to previous \\nindustry-led  quality  assurance  schemes,  the  implicitly  improved  standard  harmonization \\nshould, in principle, be seen in a positive light with regards to consumer information and \\nconsumer choice. Nevertheless, it appears that in practice, the standard harmonization has \\ntaken place at such a low level that those informational gains to consumers are outbalanced by \\nthe fact that the QS label masks shortcomings that are likely to be unanticipated by consumers \\n(neither GM feedstuff nor animal welfare criteria are currently part of the QS certification; the \\nauditing  procedures  are  not  stringent  enough  to  be  effective).  As  a  result,  diminishing \\nconsumer trust may spill over to other existing or forthcoming labeling schemes. \\n \\nHowever,  since  QS  system  participants  have  developed  a  Salmonella  monitoring  system \\nbased on the European Parliament\\u201fs regulation on the control of salmonella, QS could serve \\nas basis for a faster and more efficient introduction of the forthcoming mandatory regulation \\nat the EU level. In future, the QS scheme should also guarantee a smoother compliance with \\nthe proposed European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). But beyond the \\nSalmonella  criteria  in  QS,  it  is  also  the  establishment  of  a  central  data  base  and  thus \\ntraceability which is anticipating forthcoming EU regulation.  \\n \\nIn sum, the introduction of QS appears to have brought little, if any, immediate consumer \\ngains in terms of improving consumer choice and information, yet its pioneering character \\nand large scope across the food demand system appears to have brought some gains with \\nregards  to  the  implementation  of  future  institutional  and  regulatory  changes.  Since  the  \\n  37 \\nGerman  government  must  ultimately  defend  itself  in  terms  of  traceability  measures  and \\nSalmonella monitoring vis a vis the EU, these regulatory gains from QS may in future help to \\nreduce contested governance in the interplay between market-led and government-led food \\nsafety initiatives. \\n \\nThe  chapter  goes  on  to  explore  governance  changes  with  regards  to  the  restructuring  of \\nGerman Federal ministries and the government\\u201fs initiatives with regards to liability issues and \\ninformation  provision.  Along  with  the  criticism  and  reform  proposals  of  a  report  of  the \\nGerman court of auditors, the chapter considers three aspects of the scope of governance \\nbefore 2000, which are all relevant to exploring the extent of distrust in public authority and \\nthe legitimacy of the underlying institutional arrangements. First, the fragmentation of food \\nsafety related responsibilities across Federal ministries, second, the lack of scientific advice \\nand research that links more directly with the Ministry of agriculture, and third, the lack of \\ncoordination between the Federation, the federal states and the EU in matters of food safety. \\nAccounting for the most recent governance changes, it appears that the governance in food \\nsafety matters is less contested in the sense of Ansell and Vogel (this volume), and as judged \\nin terms of competence and accountability. Given the bundling of responsibilities and the \\nreduction in fragmentation that has taken place, the regulatory burden is also likely to be \\nreduced.  \\n \\nWith the establishment of the federal institute of risk assessment (BfR) and the federal office \\nfor consumer protection and food safety (BVL) in November 2002, a credible attempt is made \\nto separate risk analysis and risk communication from risk management. This approach is  \\n  38 \\nsimilar to the developments in France with the introduction of AFFSA (see Besan\\u00e7on et al., \\nthis  volume),  but  differs  sharply  from  the  UK  approach,  in  which  risk  assessment, \\nmanagement and communication are combined within the FSA (see Rothstein, this volume). \\nThe  creation  of  the  BfR  is  important  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of  food  safety \\nregulations  through  conducting  original  research  and  promoting  research  in  general,  and \\nthrough the use of cost-benefit analysis in particular. Since it is currently unknown to what \\nextent the BfR uses cost-benefit analyses in the regulatory process, only the promotion of \\nresearch  and  the  associated  establishment  of  a  data  network  suggests  that  regulatory \\neffectiveness is likely to be improved. Also, liability rules have been improved for producers, \\nconsumers  and  consumer  groups.  Nevertheless,  lacking  transparency  with  regards  to  data \\naccess to the outside world remains a problem. \\n \\nFinally,  this  chapter  attempts  to  make  a  brief  efficiency  assessment  of  the  emerging \\ngovernance structures. Considering a more focused and decentralized division of authority \\ntogether with tighter liability rules that should strengthen deterrence, the governance reform \\npromises efficiency gains. Together with an improvement of tasks related to risk analysis, \\ncommunication and management, it is likely that the balance between regulation and liability \\nhas been improved. Further, the reformed food safety regulations appear suited to improve \\nefficiency through the emphasis on information provision, standards and traceability, as these \\nhelp to safeguard consumers\\u201f freedom of choice. Nevertheless, the lack in deterrence due to \\nthe reduction in potential liability that comes with the limited publication of risk data is likely \\nto hamper efficiency.  \\n  \\n  39 \\nAlso, the recent and repeated defeat of the government\\u201fs \\u201einformation law\\u201f for consumers at \\nthe upper house of parliament must be seen as a setback for restoring trust in public authority. \\nFurther, extensive consumer consultation, as it is practiced in the UK through a dedicated \\nconsumer  consultive  committee  (see  Rothstein,  this  volume)  is  also  largely  missing  in \\npractice, although the BfR proclaims risk communication as an interactive process and dialog. \\nThese  two  conditions  are  all  the  more  important  with  regards  to  continuing  contested \\ngovernance, since effective risk communication is essential for building credibility, trust in \\npublic authority and thus enhancing the legitimacy of institutional arrangements.  \\n \\nIn view of the danger that the costs of different policy options may not enter into the design of \\nrisk  standards,  and  that  standard  setting  is  likely  to  reflect  evidence  of  risk  biases  and \\nresponsiveness to political factors, this chapter suggests that cost-benefit analysis should be \\nimplemented at various stages in the planning and decision making process of German food \\nsafety regulations. It is currently not evident whether or to what extent the BfR is making use \\nof these tools. Further, a multidisciplinary research effort on risk perception, which should be \\nlinked to the BfR, is important and should be initialized in order to account for critical issues \\nrelated to consumers\\u201f risk perception. To initialize such an effort appears important for an \\nefficient  design  of  governance  structures,  since  knowledge  of  perceived  risk  helps  to \\nrationalize and de-politicize risk assessment and those governance options which both the \\nBfR and BVL have on their agenda. \\n \\nA final comment is in order with regards to the internal accountability and thus legitimacy of \\nGerman governance structures related to food safety. Following the BSE crisis in Germany, it  \\n  40 \\nwas a report by the German court of auditors which came about with the cooperation of \\nconsumer groups, farmers and Ministry officials that proposed sweeping changes in the scope \\nof  governance.  Many  of  these  changes,  as  they  were  discussed  above,  have  been \\nimplemented,  anticipating  forthcoming  developments  at  the  EU  and  international  level \\n(Codex Alimentarius). In this sense, it appears that Germany\\u201fs federal system has \\u2013 despite or \\nbecause of \\u2013 its reliance on consensus-building been successful in improving the legality, \\neffectiveness and contestation of food safety regulations.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAcknowledgements \\n \\nFunding provided by the VolkswagenFoundation and hospitality of the Department of \\nAgricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Berkeley, which has made \\nthis research possible, is gratefully acknowledged. \\n \\nReferences \\n \\nAcemoglu, D. and Johnson, S. 2003.

Introduction \\nAgriculture  still  plays  an  important  role  in  Turkey\\u2019s  economy,  even  though  its  share  has  decreased \\nsignificantly during the last decades. The agricultural sector accounted about 22 per cent of the GDP at \\nthe beginning of the 1980s, but has declined to less than 10 percent in recent years. However, it is still an \\nimportant  buffer  against  urban  unemployment  and  nearly  30  percent  of  the  economically  active \\npopulation  lives  in  rural  areas,  while  agricultural  employment  accounted  for  23.7  percent  of  all \\nemployment in 2008\\n [1]. Moreover, agriculture, fishery, food products and beverages contributed around \\n8.1 percent to the total export value of US$ 132.0 billion in 2008\\n [2]. \\nThe value added of Turkish food sector is an estimated 45 billions Euros annually\\n [3]. The food sector has \\na  20 per  cent  share  in  total  production  of  the  manufacturing  sector  and  contributes  approximately \\n5 percent to the GNP. The food sector employs more than 250,000 registered workers and technical staff \\nin nearly 30,000 enterprises. Most of these are small to medium-sized enterprises\\n [4]. USDA (2004, GAIN \\nTU#4008) reports that only 17 per cent of these enterprises use formal quality control tools which also \\nimplies that there is only a small proportion of firms that meet EU safety and quality norms\\n [5]. These \\nfigures have been improved rapidly during the last few years due to the request for formal quality control \\nby  multinational  food  retail  chains  and  export  markets.  Therefore,  food  quality  issues  have  become \\nimportant issues for all stakeholders in food chain\\n1.  \\n                                                 \\n1 Food quality could be defined as the quality characteristics of food including external factors (texture, \\nflavour, origin and appearance; size, shape, colour) and internal factors -chemical, physical, microbial\\n [6]. \\nFood  quality  also  deals  with  product  traceability  of  the  raw  material,  ingredients  and  packaging  as \\nconsumers may be susceptible to any form of contamination and also require trust on manufacturing and \\nprocessing standards. In addition, food quality also deals with labelling issues to ensure that there are \\ncorrect product, ingredient and nutritional information.   3 \\nPolicies dealing with food safety and quality in Turkey started to develop in the mid-1990s due to the \\ncustom union with the EU in 1995 and strengthened in 2000s, because of increasing exports to developed \\nmarket  economies,  which  require  higher  standards  of  food  safety  and  quality.  The  penetration  of \\nsupermarkets  into  the  domestic  retail  market  is  another  driving  force  for  food  safety  and  quality\\n  [5]. \\nAnalysis of the long-term impact of the EU accession suggest that the increasing market access into the \\nEU  could  generate  a  significant  rise  in  demand  for  both,  quantity  and  quality  that  would  support  a \\nsignificant growth of agricultural and food sector in Turkey\\n [7]. Turkey has formally adopted a number of \\ntypical elements of food safety regulations and control systems in the accession period to the EU. There \\nare developments which signal some of the more formal approaches to deal with food safety.   \\nThe European Union (EU) continuously established a registration system for geographical indications \\n(GIs) that would provide protection to products across international borders, not only for wines and spirits \\nbut also for other food products\\n  [8]. Regulations (EEC) No 2081/92 and (EEC) No 2082/92 have been \\nrepealed  and  replaced  by  Regulations  (EC)  510/2006  and  (EC)  509/2006,  respectively,  and  further \\ndiscussion in the framework of the Green Paper on agricultural product quality policy (COM(2008) 641) \\nillustrate the EU process. Comparable protection for GIs in Turkey is provided by Decree-Law 555 of \\n1995 that covers both food and non-food products. In addition, draft legislations have been prepared in \\nTurkey to become in accordance with the new EU laws and regulation EC 1898/2006. As of June 2009, \\n113  products  are  registered  with  GI  certificate,  of  which  71  are  agricultural  and  food  products \\n(www.tpe.gov.tr). However, Gonenc (2007) indicates that consumers and producers were unconscious \\nabout GIs and the coverage and distinguishing characteristics of the GI-certified products were not well \\ndefined \\n[9]. \\nThe food quality concept, particularly used in brands, is a product differentiation beyond obligatory food \\nsafety standards. Therefore, it is important to review factors influencing the formation of quality brands \\nfor  especially  agricultural  and  food  products.  Hayes  and  Lence  (2002)  defined  the  criteria  for  the \\nsuccessful differentiation of an agricultural product as; \\n\\u00b7  The product must transmit price signals from consumers to producers. \\n\\u00b7  The production scale must be sufficiently large to justify the costs of creating and maintaining a \\ndifferentiated image among consumers. \\n\\u00b7  Imitations of the product must be prevented. \\n\\u00b7  Methods of supply control must not violate laws against price fixing\\n [10]. \\nFurthermore, some models were developed for the optimal choice of quality assurance systems (QAS). \\nCarriquiry and Babcock (2004) modelled two decisions; the profit-maximizing rate of output and a buyer \\nof an input should implement a QAS as a way to gain information about product quality that can be \\nprovided to its potential customers. They found that the stringency of the QAS will be higher for more \\neasily discoverable traits, more patient firms, and more attractive markets (only when the output rate is \\nfixed); firms are more likely to implement a QAS when the future is important, the quality trait is harder \\nto observe, and, of course, when the demand for the differentiated product is stronger; and the effect of \\nboth the discoverability of the quality trait and the value firms place on the future on the per period output \\nrate is in general ambiguous\\n [11]. \\nIn  the  EU,  the  Institute  of  Prospective  Technological  Studies  (IPTS)  of  the  European  Commission \\nconducted a research project on 'food quality assurance and certification schemes managed within an \\nintegrated  supply-chain  in  the  EU-25'\\n2  from  2004  to  2006,  which  was  initiated  by  the  European \\nParliament and DG Agriculture and Rural Development. The project aimed at (i) identifying the driving \\nfactors  of  the  EU-25  food  industry  development  and  their  impact  on  production  and  trade,  and  (ii) \\nanalysing the advisability of a community legal framework for protection of food quality and certification \\nschemes. This project forms the background for the underlying work of this paper.  \\nThere are several large scale projects and a lot of national studies on food quality and protection of \\ntraditional products published in the EU. Two of the large scale projects are SINER-GI and DOLPHINS \\n                                                                                                                                               \\n \\n2 For more information http://foodqualityschemes.jrc.es/en/index.html   4 \\nwhich aim to build and share a coherent scientific basis world-wide on GIs, regarding economic, legal, \\ninstitutional and socio-cultural conditions; and to ease and strengthen exchanges of the scientific results \\nof the researches conducted in European countries on origin labelled products (OLP), respectively. At the \\nend of the projects, a theoretical model for monitoring and measuring the impact of GIs was developed; a \\nworld-wide  network  of  scientists  actively  studying  and  debating  GIs  has  been  established  and \\nconsolidated; and a web based dissemination instruments in order to meet the needs of citizens, policy-\\nmakers, researchers, firms and all the other operators was activated\\n3.  \\nFragata et al. (2007) analysed the Portuguese situation with regard to public policies and product markets \\nin relation to the GI regulations of the EC\\n [12]. This study can be considered as an example for the national \\nstudy which was realised by the DOLPHIN project partner. In this paper, some challenges were presented \\nin  the  institutional  frame  of  the  protection  system  and  rural  development  policies.  The  consumer \\nknowledge concerning GIs has been found to be weak; however there is a strong correlation between the \\npreference of GIs and key socio-economic variables.  \\nThis paper presents and evaluates the institutional environment for food quality and safety in Turkey \\nincluding  the  relation  to  EU  legislation,  involved  public  and  private  organisations,  and  respective \\nrestructuring trends. The current food quality and safety issues are assessed using information obtained \\nthrough interviews with key stakeholders in the food supply chain. The paper also presents the outcome \\nfrom the Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) with producers of 9 major products in 12 different regions. The \\nsocio-economic  situation  of  farms,  producers\\u2019  knowledge,  perception  of  and  interest  in  quality  are \\nanalyses as part of the RRA. \\n2.  Methodology \\nIn this paper, following the review of the current legislation and institutions, two methods were used to \\nanalysis the Turkish food quality and safety situation. Firstly, the Strength-Weaknesses-Opportunities-\\nThreats (SWOT) method was applied to the existing food quality system in Turkey. Secondly, the Rapid \\nRural Appraisal (RRA) method was used to explore the socio-economic situations of producers and to \\ndetermine farmers' awareness, knowledge, perception and behaviour towards quality of their production.  \\nSWOT  analysis:  Experts  from  public,  semi-public  institutions  and  non-governmental  organisations \\n(NGOs) related to and interested in food quality assurance system contributed to the SWOT analysis. The \\nexperts were from different departments of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (TKB), the \\nTurkish Patent Institute (TPE), regional exporters union (Antalya), the Undersecretary of Foreign Trade \\n(DTM),  the  Turkish  Standardization  Institute  (TSE),  the  National  Productivity  Centre  (MPM),  the \\nmercantile exchange (Izmir), private companies and universities. As it is already known, the opportunities \\nand the treats of complying or non-complying with the well functioning quality assurance scheme are the \\naccess to or exclusion from export markets (such as the EU and Russia) and also from dynamic retail \\nmarketing chain, particularly for small scale producers.  This SWOT analysis particularly  focused on \\nweakness and strengths of domestic food quality assurance systems in Turkey. The SWOT analysis was \\nconducted in order to i) gather information on food quality assurance systems (working principles); ii) \\ndiscuss existing and potential interests in the EU food quality systems (Protected Designation of Origin \\n(PDO),  Protected  Geographical  Indication  (PGI)  and  Traditional  Speciality  Guaranteed  (TSG));  iii) \\nanalyse potential food products that can compete with those in the EU markets. \\nRapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) method: Information and socio-economic data on producers of selected \\nagricultural products were obtained using the RRA method. The data was analysed in order to explore the \\ncurrent  status  of  food  quality  assurance  practices,  awareness,  knowledge  and  perception  of  local \\nstakeholders. To serve this purpose, nine products and twelve regions were selected (Table 1). In each \\nselected  region,  interviews  were  arranged  with  important  regional  and/or  local  stakeholders  and  a \\nrepresentative village (or town), with respect to the overall region were determined during the interviews \\nwith key stakeholders such as the provincial agricultural directorate or producers organisations. The RRA \\nwas conducted with producers panels composed of at least 8-10 participants. The demographic structure \\n                                                 \\n3 See www.origin-food.org for more information.   5 \\nof the villages and the farm households, improvements and investments in production techniques and \\nprogress in product quality were addressed. A semi-structured questionnaire was prepared to obtain basic \\ndescriptive  information  and  data  related  to  the  main  aims  mentioned  above.  In  the  first  part  of  the \\nquestionnaire, questions on the demographic structure of the selected villages and the economic situation \\nof the producers were placed. The questions of the second part aimed to explore the knowledge of the \\nproducers about their product and its quality as well as the producers\\u2019 interest in quality issues and their \\nexpectations for improvements of their product quality in the near future. The RRA study regions were \\nselected according to the importance of the products in terms of production volume in national agriculture \\nand/or the reputation of the region for the respective products. Interviews aimed to obtain information on \\nthe  production  process,  farm  structure,  developments  in  terms  of  food  quality  and  safety,  recent \\nproduction and trade data on representative production regions in the province and/or sub-province.  \\nTable 1.

Institutional environment for food quality and safety in Turkey \\nThe Turkish Decree-Law No. 560 and the Turkish Food Codex were prepared in 1995. Accordingly, the \\nMinistry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (TKB) were both responsible for \\nregistering and giving production permission to food manufactures and also for food safety controls at \\nselling and serving points, as well as onsite inspections of food producing plants and of food retailers and \\nmarkets. The EU accession process has called for a conversion of the food legislation. After the new Food \\nLaw No. 5179 was published in 2004, TKB has become the competent authority for food inspection at all \\nstages  from  production  to  consumption  and  TKB  took  over  the  sole  responsibility  for  food  safety \\ninspection; on the other hand, the inspection and analysis of drinking water remained in the responsibility \\nof Ministry of Health.  \\n \\nLocal administrations have certain authorities in terms of implementation of the food legislation such as \\nissuing  operation  permits  for  food  processors  and  food  registration  formalities  under  the  Greater \\nMunicipalities Law No. 5216, the Municipalities Law No. 5393 and Law 5302 on Special Provincial \\nAdministrations,  which  were  enforced  in  2004  and  2005.  However,  this  has  created  problems  in \\nmaintaining a centralised structure for monitoring and intervention, in order to ensure effectiveness of \\nfood safety\\n control and monitoring \\n[13]. Although, there is no clear division between authorities, local \\nmunicipalities  have  also  responsibilities  for  food  safety  controls  at  selling  points  in  their  vicinities. \\nMunicipalities are not equally organised and competent for employing food inspectors in their area of \\nresponsibility; to our knowledge only Ankara Cankaya Municipality has an effective control team and \\nmost of the small municipalities do not even have food inspectors. There are five public and one semi-\\npublic institution with high importance for food quality and safety in Turkey. All institutions in the field \\nof food safety and quality, their roles and harmonisation status with the EU legislation are presented in \\nTable 2.  \\nTable 2.

The SWOT results: current food quality and safety issues in \\nTurkey \\nThe results of the SWOT analysis were obtained through opinions and interactions of experts from key \\nstakeholders on the following subjects: i) working principles of the food quality assurance certification \\nsystem  (Table  3);  ii)  existing  and  potential  interests  to  the  EU  food  quality  systems  (Table  4);  iii) \\npotential food products to compete in the EU markets (Table 5). In the presentation of the results strength \\nand opportunities as well as weaknesses and threats are grouped. \\nTable 3. Working principles of food quality assurance certification systems in Turkey \\n  Weaknesses/threats  Strengths/opportunities \\nSet up a new quality system  High costs   Developing exponentially \\nInstitutional frame  Inefficient capacity   High interest from the institutions  \\nConsumer oriented  Unknown consumer attitudes   Increase in consumer demands  \\nProducer oriented  Low interests from producers  Food industry is gaining power \\nAccession period to the EU  Very slow progress   Adaptation of legislation is sustained \\nIt is recognised that to set up a food quality assurance systems is costly for firms, particularly SMEs that \\nalso includes the cost of proper packaging, ads, bar-coding to the quality system. Moreover, there is no \\nquality premium for certificated products in Turkey, although additional effort is needed to provide food \\nquality. Therefore, especially small and financially-weak enterprises are facing problems in switching to \\nthe  production  of  quality  products.  Nevertheless,  the  number  of  entities  with  ISO  9000  and  22000 \\naccreditation is increasing. Additionally, food quality assurance systems have been developing, demand \\nfor quality product has been increasing and having a food quality assurance systems in place has started to \\nbe  a  competition  tool.  Furthermore,  both  producers  and  consumers  have  positive  attitudes  about  the \\npresence of ISO 9000, ISO 22000 and TSE certificates in the food chain. \\nIn the institutional frame, small scale manufactures have limited capacity to obtain quality certificates and \\nto  receive  the  potential  benefits.  The  role  of  governmental  organisations  is  not  well  defined  in  the \\nadministration of quality assurance system and the coordination between governmental bodies appears to \\nbe inefficient. This might be originating from the overlapping responsibilities of government bodies and \\nthe slowness of bureaucracy. However, governmental organisations have been restructured during EU \\naccession period and they have close relationship with similar bodies in the EU. Third party control has \\nincreased the efficiency of inspection and supplier audits have been more numerous.    8 \\nSo far, no comprehensive consumer survey has been analysed consumer expectations for and satisfaction \\nwith food quality in Turkey. In addition, consumers do not have sufficient knowledge about food quality. \\nBut there is an increasing demand by customers for product information. In fact, consumer demand for \\nfood quality is changing following changes in purchasing power, age, urbanisation and education level.  \\nOn the producer side, investment in food quality systems is in most cases not profitable (as no premium \\ncan be achieved). Producers or food plant owner are also unconscious about food quality and traditional \\nentities are too conservative to these improvement. Food quality assurance systems can not be fully and \\neffectively applied in the field. However, the large-scale food industry has been exporting to world food \\nmarkets and they are fulfilling the linked safety and quality requirements. In addition, there is a large \\nqualified workforce in Turkey to implement and complement food quality assurance systems. \\nThe lengthy accession period of Turkey to the EU results in a slow harmonisation process with the EU \\nlegislation,  though  it  leads  to  the  enforcement  of  international  legislation,  and  improvements  of  the \\ntraceability systems supported by these legislations. \\nTable 4. Existing and potential interests to the EU food quality systems in Turkey \\n  Weaknesses/threats  Strengths/opportunities \\nQuality awareness and \\ninterest in quality \\nLack of awareness of the producer \\nand the consumer \\nMore interest for quality demand \\nUsage of communication  Communication channels are not \\nused well enough \\nIncrease in communication power \\nto disseminate quality conscious  \\nInstitutional/organisational  Lack of implementation inside the \\nInstitutions \\nCompetition in food industry \\nInterest    Increase in research and \\nincentives for quality production \\nInternational agreements   Undefined technical barriers in \\ntrade \\n \\nQuality awareness of consumer in Turkey is weak compared to developed countries. There is also a big \\ndifference in the perception of quality between urban and rural areas, because of lower educational and \\nincome levels. Full trust in quality systems has not been established yet (products from specific rural \\nareas are still more trusted than certification). However, there is an increase in consumer awareness that \\nsupports the product quality and safety improvements. There are also trends towards healthy diets, thus \\nconsumers demand healthier and safer foods. Another fact is that a higher educational level leads to \\nincreasing demand for quality products. \\nConsidering communication tools, it was recognised that the information flow is not sufficient in amount \\nand clarity. Moreover, enterprises are weak in using communication tools and communication channels \\nand media have not given enough importance to the issue of food safety and quality. Nonetheless, the \\nawareness  due  to  increasing  number  of  consulting,  certification  firms  and  variety  of  communication \\nchannels is raising.  \\nThere  is  also  lack  of  trust  in  certification  bodies  as  a  result  of  unethical  issues  -like  insufficient  or \\npretended auditing. Documentation is also difficult for the entrepreneurs that have not enough employees. \\nHowever, SMEs try to increase product variety by the researches on quality that leads to increase in \\ncompetition. \\nIn  international  food  markets,  technical  barriers  and  sanitary  and  phyto-sanitary  requirements  exist, \\nespecially in developed countries. Positively, there is an increase in academic interest (R&D) in food \\nquality related research. Furthermore, rural development incentives and support have sharply increased in \\nrecent years for the production of quality products. \\n   9 \\nTable 5. Potential food products in Turkey that can compete in the EU markets \\n  Weaknesses/threats  Strengths/opportunities \\nProduction oriented  Low level of production \\ntechniques \\nProduction potential \\nProduct oriented  Lack of infrastructure of internal \\nmechanisms \\nLarge spectrum of present \\nproduce \\nInternational trade  Difficulties in trade with the EU  Attracting  the  interest  of  foreign \\ndemand \\nWhen Turkish food products can compete in the EU market, it is difficult to maintain the quality standard \\nof product. Thus, in competitive markets quality standards have to obeyed, which are costly and may \\nreduce profits due to higher production costs. Production and processing units in Turkey have in many \\ncases not been audited sufficiently by the authorities; therefore, only few food producers can meet EU \\nstandards. There are a high number of small enterprises, who do not have any knowledge how to use \\nadvanced marketing strategies. Nevertheless, there exist abundant resources for agricultural production in \\nTurkey. The producers are improving by switching to more efficient production methods and there is a \\npotential to diversify production. \\nSupport to quality products, with a competitive potential, has so far not been sufficient and there is no \\nfood  product  based  organisations  specialised  in  quality  production.  However,  diversification  of \\nproduction is growing and there are an abundant number of endemic food products in Turkey with GI and \\ntraditional production protection potential, especially hazelnuts, raisins, apricots, capers, figs, frozen fruits \\nand vegetables, olive oil, poultry products. There is a great variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, and \\nfishery  products  (sea  and  inland  water)  with  potential  for  organic  production.  Traditional  products, \\nmedical and aromatic plants, goat meat and lamb, and milk (varieties of yogurt and cheese, local ice-\\ncream) are also candidates for GIs. \\nIn the trade between Turkey and the EU some constraints for Turkey are still exist because it is not a full \\nmember of the EU, e.g. EU import quotas for processed food products, the entry price system for fresh \\nfruits and vegetables, diverting legislation for fishery products. There are also retailer, national and EU \\nstandard for food products, production and marketing. Moreover producers in Turkey can not produce at \\nthe  same  quality  level  as  in  the  EU,  mostly  due  to  financial  constraints,  governance  structure  and \\nfragmented production structure. Even so, Turkey has a potential in agro-eco tourism, and the presence of \\na large variety of food products may contribute to attractiveness for EU tourists. The number of Turkish \\ncitizens in the EU is another advantage for Turkish food products to enter the EU market. There is also a \\npotential to differentiate product from EU products due to the different environmental and natural in \\nTurkey. \\n5.  RRA Method: Socio-economic situation of producers  \\nAt  this  stage,  firstly  the  socio-economic  and  demographic  structure  of  the  selected  villages  were \\ndetermined,  and  secondly,  the  answers  of  producers  on  the  quality  issues  were  evaluated  using  five \\ndifferent scales: 'too weak', 'weak', 'fair', 'good' and 'excellent'; taken as 1 to 5, respectively. During the \\nevaluation of answers, no answers and  wrong/false answers  were categorised as  'too weak'; partially \\ncorrect answers as 'weak';  correct answers combined with no applications as 'fair'; with some applications \\nas 'good' and both correct answers and applications as 'excellent'. \\nProducers could not accumulate capital since they have got low profits from their products during last few \\nyears. This is a handicap for them to expand and to invest into quality (this could be an indicator for \\ndetermining incentive policies for SMEs, current incentives on organic production and GAP application \\nare  more  suitable  for  costly  investments).  Therefore,  producers  could  be  clustered  in  producer \\norganisations to collaborate in quality production. Moreover, it is necessary to support products with a \\nmodel when they produced in required quality and having GIs certificates.

In  Afyon,  the  only  aim  of  getting  PGI  for  sucuk  production  is  the \\nprotection of the traditional production methods, not marketing purposes. The labour costs in olive oil \\nproduction are high and many small shops exist in Ayvalik (Balikesir). Food safety is priority in the \\ntomato production in Kumluca, Antalya and the grape and raisin production in Alasehir (Manisa) to \\ncomply with export market requirements and requested export formalities. Apple production in Egirdir \\n(Isparta) is so convenient for GAP applications because there is a limited but equipped production area \\n(such  as  drip  irrigation  systems,  pesticide  preparation  areas,  warehouses,  packaging  units  etc.).  Fig \\nproducers in Aydin could get higher prices for their products because it is a unique place for producing \\nhigh quality dry figs. Dried apricots are sold in bulk so it is impossible to use GIs in Malatya. Orange \\nproducers in Antalya also get higher prices for their products because Finike orange has unique taste and \\nharvesting period is almost one month early. There are marketing advantages for orange producers in \\nMersin because its location is so close to the citrus exporters and fresh-cut fruit and fruit-juice producers. \\nBuffalo milk producers in Afyon could add extra value to milk with producing traditional milk products \\n(cream). Milk producers in Burdur get premium milk prices because the producers are very well clustered   13 \\nwithin cooperatives in this region. Milk producers in Konya and Karaman could get value added product \\nby producing cheese. \\nAs result, relating to the criteria elaborated by Hayes and Lence (2002) for successful differentiation of \\nagricultural products, it is found that some products in RRA studies could potentially be successful cases \\nas GIs; \\n\\u00b7  Ayvalik olive oil; \\n\\u00b7  Finike oranges; \\n\\u00b7  Afyon cream; and \\n\\u00b7  Sucuk (It should be analysed whether this product could achieve a premium price versus private \\nbrands). \\n \\nSome products were determined as having potential for organic production;  \\n\\u00b7  Dried Apricots; \\n\\u00b7  Dried figs; \\n\\u00b7  Milk (only for medium and large scale farms); and  \\n\\u00b7  Beef (only for medium and large scale farms). \\n \\nSome products were determined as favourable for GAP application: \\n\\u00b7  Citrus; \\n\\u00b7  Apples; \\n\\u00b7  Tomatoes; \\n\\u00b7  Milk (region needs to be announced as animal diseases free by TKB); and   \\n\\u00b7  Meat (region needs to be announced as animal diseases free by TKB). \\nIn addition, Divle Obruk cheese in Konya and Karaman could be certificated with a TSG. \\n6.  Conclusion \\nLack of quality awareness of consumer and producers is determined as the main problem by the SWOT \\nanalysis. Producers\\u2019 knowledge about food quality aspects is limited and their perception about quality \\nmainly focuses on food safety. Furthermore unorganised small scale producers are not in a position to \\nsolve quality issues by themselves. The coordination and collaboration among stakeholders in the food \\nchain are too weak to develop/ensure quality assurance scheme, with continuous product supply of a \\ndefined quality level. Different organisations/institutions share the responsibility for parts of the final \\nquality and quality control. Moreover, there are a lot of institutional conflicts, not only for the relationship \\nbetween organisations/institutions but also within organisations.  \\nThere  have  been  only  few  academic  studies  and  research  projects  in  this  research  field,  funded  by \\nTUBITAK (the scientific and technological research council of Turkey) that also need to be extended \\ntowards quality assurance system.  \\nIncentives for food quality need to be improved for primary production and all the processing levels to \\nhave  a  complementary  perspective.  Existing  incentives  are  generally  focused  on  safety  and  quality \\naspects covering organic agriculture, GAP and partly for processing levels. Thus, SMEs and small scale \\nagricultural  holdings  are  not  financially  supported  to  improve  quality  assurance  that  prevents  their \\nexpansion  and/or  investment  in  production  quality.  Therefore,  it  is  hard  for  small  producers  and \\nenterprises to accumulate capital. This situation leads in consequence to their exclusion from dynamic \\nfood markets. \\nThere exist export barriers due to quality requirements, which reduce the Turkish share in world food \\nmarkets,  besides,  developments  to  improve  infrastructure,  generally  with  regard  to  food  safety  as \\nminimum legal requirements, requested by importing countries and/or multinational food retail chains.   14 \\nKey local stakeholders are not organised enough to obtain GI certification for important food products in \\ntheir region. Moreover, producers are uninformed about GIs and are too far from this subject due to their \\nfragmented and small scale characteristics. There was only one producer union established by regional \\nproducers  which  obtained  a  GI  certificate.  The  other  certifications  were  obtained  by  unions  of \\ncooperatives,  chambers  of  commerce  and  industry,  municipalities  and/or  provincial  governments. \\nObservations showed great improvements in milk production quality, which now exceeds minimum food \\ncodex requirements. The main driver for this improvement is the existence of large scale national and \\ninternational dairy companies that push quality standards in the market. However, small producers could \\nbe excluded from this dynamic market because of their traditional production techniques and the non-\\ncompliance of their infrastructure with buyer requirements. Through the RRA studies, no case has been \\nfound where small producers are engaged in organic production and also their intention to involve in \\norganic production is weak. \\nQuality awareness of consumers and producers needs to be improved by training and communication to \\novercome food safety and quality problems in Turkey. For this purpose, institutions like TKB, DPT, TPE, \\nTSE, TZOB (Union of Turkish Chamber of Agricultural) etc. should corporate and arrange meetings with \\nmedia representatives and journalists on food quality; public TV channels (TRT) and other national and \\nalso local channels should keep the topic on their agenda. Campaigns should be organised intended to \\nraise public awareness, supported by sector associations, TKB and other public institutes. Cooperation \\nbetween TKB and MEB (Ministry of National Education) could result in the preparation of leaflets and \\ndistribution to students. A complementary perspective and coordination among responsible institutions is \\nrequired with regard to food quality. Infrastructure investments for improving food quality assurance \\nsystems should be sustained by TKB and other related institutes in line with the development of quality \\nand  safety  demands  on  domestic  and  international  food  markets.  Projects  for  quality  infrastructure \\ndevelopment should be sustained by using the EU and/or World Bank (WB) grants. TKB should design \\nsupport  schemes  to  further  improve  food  quality,  including  GIs  and  \\u2018Trade  Mark\\u2019  products.  The \\nUndersecretariat of Foreign Trade (DTM) should support the export of safety and quality guaranteed \\nproducts and conduct market research for the product having potential to get organic label and a high \\nlevel  of  quality  standard  for  improving  exportation  of  value  added  products.  Recently,  Commodity \\nPromotion  Groups  has  established  to  promote  consumption  of  the  product  (including  milk,  citrus, \\nhazelnuts, apricots) both in domestic and foreign markets. The product promotion groups are acted as a \\nsemi-public institution and directorate of the board is appointed by the DTM. The product promotion \\ngroups has budget to support market research as well. \\nKOSGEB (Small and Medium Industry Development Organization in Turkey) and TKB should associate \\nrural development supports with traceability applications. \\nIn conclusion, the EU accession period should not be interrupted and the adaptation of legislation should \\nbe completed accordingly. Future investigations should focus on supply chain analysis and obstacles for \\ncollaboration among key actors in the supply chain, on consumer response to quality in domestic markets \\nand on the prevention of small scale producers\\u2019 exclusion from restructuring markets. \\nAcknowledgement and Disclaimer \\nThis paper is prepared from the FQAS-TURK project supported by the European Commission, Joint \\nResearch Centre (JRC), Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) (contract n\\u00b0 151089-2008 \\nA08-TK).

One of the products of this program is a series of\\nguidebooks that define a NASA concept of the assurance processes\\nthat are used in software development.\\nThe Software Assurance Guidebook, NASA-GB-A201, issued in\\nSeptember, 1989, provides an overall picture of the NASA concepts\\nand practices in software assurance. Second level guidebooks\\nfocus on specific activities that fall within the software\\nassurance discipline, and provide more detailed information for\\nthe manager and/or practitioner.\\nThis is the second level Software Quality Assurance Audits\\nGuidebook that describes software quality assurance audits in a\\nway that is compatible with practices at NASA Centers. For a\\nmore generalized view of how software quality assurance audits\\nrelate to Software Assurance, refer to the Software Assurance\\nGuidebook, document number NASA-GB-A201.\\nI. GENERAL\\nThe NASA Software Assurance Guidebook classifies the software\\nquality assurance (SQA) audit as a fundamental quality assurance\\ntechnique. It is the intent of this guidebook to further define\\naudits, describe the audit process, and provide a sample\\nchecklist that can be tailored for use in an audit. The\\nguidebook is written for quality assurance practitioners who will\\nperform audits, software developers who will be audited, and for\\nsoftware project managers and acquirers who have to decide the\\nextent of auditing to be done.\\nhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19980228457 2020-06-15T23:30:49+00:00Z\\nIn this guidebook, the term \\\"audit\\\" specifically refers to an SQA\\ntechnique that is used to examine the conformance of a\\ndevelopment process to procedures and the conformance of products\\nto standards. An SQAaudit also can examine the conformance of\\nthe actual status of the development activity to the reported\\nstatus. The term \\\"audit\\\" is used to describe a numberof\\nadditional software activities; however, due to their different\\npurpose and focus, they are not addressed in this guidebook. For\\nexample, the Functional Configuration Audit (FCA)and Physical\\nConfiguration Audit (PCA)are configuration management(CM)\\nactivities. Quality (Engineering) Audits and Safety Audits are\\ntechnical activities that evaluate a software product against\\nQuality Engineering and Safety requirements. These types of\\naudits are not covered in this guidebook.\\nII. CONCEPTSANDDEFINITIONS\\nAn SQAaudit is an activity that is performed to determine the\\nadherence to, and adequacy of, a project's established software\\ndevelopment standards and procedures and the effectiveness of\\ntheir implementation. As used in this guidebook, the main\\nobjective of an SQAaudit is to determine the adherence to\\nestablished standards and procedures; checking their adequacy or\\neffectiveness is a secondary objective that usually is not\\nrequested of an auditor.\\nIn the NASASoftware Assurance Guidebook, standards are defined\\nas \\\"the established criteria to which software products are\\ncompared.\\\" Software standards include documentation standards,\\ndesign standards, and coding standards. In that guidebook,\\nprocedures are defined as the \\\"established criteria to which the\\ndevelopment and control processes are compared.\\\" Procedures,\\nthen, are the step-by-step directions that are to be followed to\\naccomplish somedevelopment or control process; for example, CM\\nor nonconformancereporting and corrective action (NRCA). In\\nother words, standards and procedures are requirements for\\nsoftware management,engineering, and assurance; SQAaudits\\nverify their existence and assess a project's compliance with\\nthem.\\nSQAaudits also can comparethe actual status of a product with\\nreported status. Status auditing is most effective if there are\\nobjective and consistent criteria for evaluating the level of\\nproduct completeness. For example, Unit DevelopmentFolders\\n(UDFs)have a cover sheet for recording the progress of a unit\\nthrough its development stages; the folder contains the actual\\nproduct. If a project uses UDFs, then an audit can comparethe\\nactual product to the cover sheet and to the progress report.\\nThe actual processes and products examined by an audit will vary\\ndepending on the objective of the audit. The objective of the\\naudit can vary, and is determined by the organization that called\\nfor the audit. A general audit provides a comprehensive\\noverview, while a limited audit might be an examination of\\ncertain procedures, such as CM, or a check on a certain\\nrequirement, such as \\\"Are coding standards being followed?\\\"\\nAn audit maybe described as internal or external, depending on\\nthe organization of origin of the auditor(s). An internal audit\\nis an audit conducted by the SQAstaff of the software developer.\\nInternal audits are intended to be preventative in nature; to\\ndetect problems before they becomemajor.\\nAn external audit is one performed by an independent auditor who\\nis outside of the developing organization. External audits are\\nmost often requested by the acquiring organization, as a meansof\\nobtaining an independent opinion about the work in progress.\\nExternal audits tend to be more comprehensive in nature than\\ninternal audits, and usually encompassa broad area of the\\ndevelopment activity. Such audits usually are requested because\\nthe acquirer is uncertain of the effectiveness of the internal\\nprogram or because of lack of information and fears about the\\nquality of performance on the part of the developer. An\\nadvantage of an external audit is that the auditor maybe more\\nobjective about a project than an internal auditor; however, an\\nexternal auditor must spend more time learning about the project\\nand its development process.\\nIII. CONDUCTINGANSQAAUDIT\\nAn SQAaudit has four phases: planning and preparation, the site\\nvisit, reporting, and follow-up. During the planning and\\npreparation phase, the auditor gains an understanding of the\\nproject. Based on the scope of the audit, the auditor determines\\nthe specific questions that need to be answered, as well as the\\npersons to be interviewed and the records and products to be\\nexamined to answer the questions. The interviews are conducted,\\nand records and products are examined during the site visit. The\\nreporting phase consists of the exit debriefing of the audited\\nproject, the preparation of a written report on the audit, and\\nclarifying issues and providing related information as needed.\\nFollow-up is done by the project, as the problems and\\ndeficiencies found in the audit are remedied. Follow-up may\\ninclude reauditing to assess the adequacy of the remedies.\\nThe activities conducted during the phases vary depending on the\\nlife cycle phase of the project being audited and the scope of\\nthe audit. The activities also vary depending on whether the\\naudit is external or internal; an external audit requires more\\nextensive preparation and should examine a more comprehensive\\nsample of material than an internal audit.\\nEach of the four phases of an audit is described in the following\\nsections. The activities of each phase are described as if a\\ngeneral, external audit is to be done since this results in the\\ngreatest detail. Someof the activities maybe superfluous to an\\ninternal SQAaudit and maybe omitted.\\nA. Audit Planning and Preparation\\nA general SQAaudit should be planned carefully to examine all of\\nthe software engineering, management,and assurance processes and\\nall of their products. Software managementprocesses include\\nstatus reporting and CM. Engineering processes include analysis,\\ndesign, and code. Assurance processes include verification and\\nvalidation (V&V)and NRCA. Products include documentsand code.\\nIf the scope of the audit is more limited, then planning will be\\nwithin the defined limits. A limited audit might examine only\\none of the processes or a limited set of products. Activities\\nduring the planning and preparation phase are similar for all\\naudits, but preparation for a limited audit is focused on the\\nidentified process or product.\\nAs a first step, the auditor should understand the objective of\\nthe software development project and what products are to be\\nproduced. The auditor needs to know what the contract requires\\nin the way of deliverable software and documentation, and what,\\nif any, requirements exist for management,engineering, and\\nassurance practices. Onesource of this information maybe the\\nstatement of work and other contract documents. Onceit is clear\\nwhat is being developed and what the contract requires, the\\nauditor should review managementdocumentation, such as the\\nsoftware management,development, and assurance plans to\\nunderstand the processes that will be used to develop and control\\nthe products. Then the developer's standards and procedures\\nmanual should be reviewed to determine the quality standards and\\nthe detailed procedures planned to be applied to the software and\\nthe development process. From this background information, the\\nauditor should be able to understand the developer's software\\ndevelopment process.\\nThe auditor also should review somerecent status reports from\\nthe developer. These reports will furnish information on the\\nstage of completeness of products and maycontain information as\\nto problem areas.\\nAfter background familiarization and a look at project status,\\nthe auditor should define the areas that will require the most\\ncareful and detailed attention, i.e., the processes or products\\nthat seemto be in somedifficulty or whosestatus is in doubt.\\nThese areas maybe identified by the status reports, discussions\\nwith the acquirer of the software (if it is the acquirer who has\\nrequested the audit), review of nonconformancereports, and the\\nresults of previous audits.\\nOncethe auditor understands the project and has identified the\\nareas of concentration, he/she should develop a checklist. A\\nchecklist is a list of items to be examined and questions to be\\nasked. Each checklist should be tailored for the specific\\nproject being audited and its life cycle phase and should reflect\\nthe scope of the audit. A more comprehensive and less detailed\\nchecklist is required for a general audit; a limited audit\\nrequires a checklist that is more detailed in specific areas.\\nGuidance on preparing a checklist is given in Chapter VI. A\\nchecklist is intended to provide the auditor with a \\\"road map\\\"\\nduring the site visit. It must be complete, so that the auditor\\ncan know that sufficient information has been gathered if all of\\nthe checklist items are completed. The checklist questions help\\ndefine the individuals with whomthe auditor wishes an interview\\nand the types of records that the auditor will examine.\\nThe auditor should schedule the site visit to the project through\\nits assurance staff or other suitable contact after the\\npreparation is done and the checklist prepared. During this\\ncontact with the project, the auditor should specify the intent\\nof the audit, the records to be examined, and which people the\\nauditor wishes to interview. People to be interviewed will\\ninclude managers, selected developers, CMstaff, assurance staff,\\nand testers. Copies of the checklist maybe furnished to\\nincrease the project's understanding. The project should be\\nprepared to provide the auditor with a convenient working area\\nthat includes normal office facilities, access to all products\\nand records, and interviews with the identified individuals.\\nB. The Site Visit\\nThe purpose of the audit site visit is to collect the data\\nnecessary to assess that the required products are being\\nproduced, the degree to which they conform to applicable\\nstandards, how well procedures are being followed, and that the\\nreported status corresponds to the actual status. The audit is\\nintended to uncover any significant deviation from standards,\\nprocedures, or reported status so that corrective action can be\\ntaken. The auditor uses two basic techniques: interviews with\\nproject staff and examination of documentation and records.\\nThe site visit should begin with an entrance briefing, involving\\nthe auditor and key project staff. During this briefing, the\\nauditor should describe the focus of the audit, and identify the\\ninterviews to be conducted and the records to be examined. The\\nentrance briefing mayalso be used by the project to brief the\\nauditor on its processes, key staff members,and current status.\\nTime for questions and answers should be included. The auditor\\nalso should assure the project that an exit interview will be\\nheld where the auditor will present preliminary findings to the\\nproject and the project mayprovide any additional information to\\nthe auditor. This preliminary exchange of information can\\nsignificantly help to allay the fears of the project and to\\nsmooth the course of the site visit.\\nAfter the entrance briefing, the auditor should proceed with the\\ngathering of information. It is useful to begin the information\\ngathering process with interviews, during which the auditor tries\\nto understand the realities behind the documentedplans and\\nprocedures. The auditor should learn which individuals carry out\\na procedure, approve a change or fix, keep project records, etc.\\nEach individual should be asked to describe his/her perceptions\\nof and interactions with the process. The auditor should take\\nnotes, annotate or develop procedural flow diagrams, ask\\nquestions to clarify, and makeit his/her objective to clearly\\nunderstand the process. In particular, the auditor should be\\nalert for indications of shortcuts or abbreviations to the\\nprocedure. During interviews, the auditor must rememberthat\\ndata are being gathered, and that conclusions should wait until\\nall of the facts are in. This provides a clearer understanding\\nof the actual processes used on the project and eases\\ncommunications with the staff. The checklist developed during\\nthe preparation phase is used to guide the discussions during the\\ninterview.\\nOncethe auditor is sure that the processes and procedures are\\nunderstood as they really exist, he/she should begin examining\\nthe tangible parts of the project: its products and records.\\nProducts consist of requirements and design documentation,\\nincluding unit development folders, user manuals, code, etc.\\nRecords consist of memorandaand forms that document the events\\nin the life of a product. They comefrom CM, NRCA,and V&V,\\namongothers.\\ni. Records Examination\\nThe auditor examines records to see if a procedure is being\\ncorrectly followed. Record examination is described below in\\nterms of the principal processes that SQAaudits examine: CM,\\nNRCA,and V&V. Similar activities would be used in the\\nexamination of other sets of records.\\n\\u2022 CMAudit\\nDuring an audit of CM, the auditor should look at the complete\\nchange control cycle, beginning with the initial processing of a\\nchange request; through analysis of impact and dispositioning;\\ndesign, code, and testing; updating of documentation; submission\\nof the modified products to the library; and closure of the\\nchange request. Records to be examined include the change\\nrequests as processed by the ChangeControl Board, the work\\nauthorizing documents issued as a result of approved changes, the\\ncode and documentation products that are intended to reflect the\\napproved changes, and the program library records that capture\\nthe changes to code and data. Throughout the audit, the auditor\\nshould be alert for and documentany evidence of unauthorized\\nchanges.\\nThe records should show the authorization of each change, the\\nproduct(s) to be changed, and the version numbersof the changed\\nproduct. Muchof the auditor's attention should be devoted to\\nthe Program Library or equivalent, since this is where the\\nvarious versions of products and the change documentscontrolling\\nthose versions are stored. The auditor should check the products\\nin the library to ensure that documentation is up-to-date with\\ncode changes. The auditor should check the version numbering and\\nidentification schemes, and the control documents. The records\\nshould demonstrate that there are adequate security measures in\\nplace to prevent loss and unauthorized changes. The auditor\\nshould verify that every item of code and documentation in the\\nprogram library was properly received.\\n\\u2022 NRCAAudit\\nWhenauditing the NRCAsystem, the auditor should look at the\\ncomplete cycle. The auditor should review the nonconformance\\nreports that are filed, to assure that they are completely and\\ncorrectly filled out. The disposition process and board actions\\nshould be recorded, usually on the sameform. The\\nnonconformancesthat result in product changes should be tracked\\nto the product, and evidence should be gathered that changes are\\nmade, tested or reviewed, and approvals for issuance are granted.\\nThe NRCAprocedures will parallel those used in CM, and can be\\naudited in muchthe sameway, especially whenit comesto the\\nprogram library. In both cases (CMand NRCA),the auditor should\\npay particular attention to corrected products to assure that\\nthey still satisfy requirements and standards.\\n\\u2022 V&VAudit\\nAn audit of V&Vprocedures should include a check of the\\nverification matrix or equivalent, to assure that every\\nrequirement has a test and every test checks a requirement. Test\\nplans should be adequate, specifying the test environment, test\\nprocedures, and the expected results for each test. Test\\nprocedures should be clear and detailed. Test plans and\\nprocedures should be reviewed and approved.\\nThe auditor should verify from SQArecords that test procedures\\nwere followed and that all nonconformancesobserved during\\ntesting are recorded in the NRCAsystem. In addition to testing,\\nthe auditor should assess other methods of V&V, if used. For\\nexample, if inspections or another form of peer reviews are used\\nto find problems, the auditor should verify that the records of\\nthe review show that they were done and that corrections and\\nchanges agreed to in the review are madein the product.\\n2. Product Examination\\nThe intent of examination of products is two-fold: to see if\\nstandards are being followed, and to see if status is accurately\\nreported. Documentsare measuredagainst documentation\\nrequirements to makesure that all required documentsexist, and\\nagainst documentation standards to ensure that they have the\\ncorrect content and style. The auditor must read enough of the\\ndocumentsto form an opinion on the above; that is, the auditor\\nmust be able to determine that a documentpresented as showing\\nthe design indeed contains design information. On the other\\nhand, the auditor is not responsible for the technical\\ncorrectness of the documentsand should not spend time trying to\\nascertain if the documentsare correct.\\nCodealso is examined to determine if it meets standards. Code\\nstandards are likely to include rules for internal documentation,\\nsize of modules, styling formats, and other such items that the\\nauditor can verify. Rules for coding constructs or variable\\nnaming conventions are more difficult to verify. If the project\\nhas a code standards checker, the auditor mayrun it on some\\ncode. If the standards checker is to be run at a certain step in\\nthe development process, or if peer reviews are used to verify\\ncoding standards, the auditor must have access to those records.\\nProducts also are examined to comparetheir status with that\\nreported. Documentsreported as complete, for example, should\\ncontain all of the sections given in the table of contents (which\\nmaybe prescribed by a documentation standard), should be signed\\nby the approving authorities, and should contain few, if any, To-\\nBe-Determined (TBDs)items. Codeimplementation usually goes\\nthrough the steps of detailed design, code, peer review, and unit\\ntest. A module that is reported as complete should have gone\\nthrough all of the above steps, should meet the coding standards,\\nand should have whatever approvals are required. The Unit\\nDevelopmentFolder or equivalent should contain all of the\\nevidence to look at status of coding.\\n3. Sampling\\nDuring the process of checking records and products, the auditor\\nusually cannot examine each and every item; therefore, some\\nsampling process must be used. The auditor must decide on sample\\nsizes that can be accommodatedin the site visit. The sample\\nsizes must be balanced between completeness of coverage (some\\nitems from each product or set of records) and depth of coverage(numberof items from a specific product or set of records) . If\\nthe focus of the audit is limited, the sample size can be larger\\nfor the specific product or processes that are to be covered. In\\ndeciding on sample sizes, the auditor must allow time to follow\\nup in more depth in areas where the initial sample indicates\\nproblems. The specific products or records to be included in the\\nsample should be chosen by some\\\"randomizing\\\" method, and the\\nproject staff should not be informed in advance which items will\\nbe examined and which will not.\\nC. Audit Reporting\\nOncethe interviews and record examination have been completed,\\ninitial results should be shared with the staff of the audited\\nproject during an exit interview. The exit interview provides an\\nopportunity to clear up misunderstandings and allows project\\nstaff to present any information that they feel the auditor\\nfailed to consider. In addition, project staff learn immediately\\nabout the problems that have been found and can begin making\\nplans to correct them.\\nAfter adjusting the initial results to reflect the information\\ngathered in the exit interview, the auditor prepares a written\\nfinal report. The report should be organized to highlight the\\nmost significant results, addressing both problems and\\ncommendations, and should include a general narrative of the\\naudit. An example table of contents for an audit report is shown\\nin Appendix A. The audit report should be addressed to the\\nmanagementofficial who arranged for the audit, if the audit is\\nexternal; or directed as required by procedures, if internal.\\nThe objective of the audit report is to present a clear picture\\nof the status of a development activity or a facet of the\\nactivity to project management. The report must be clear,\\nobjective, and factual. In somecases, the auditor will find\\nthat, while procedures are being followed or standards are being\\nmet, the procedures or standards are not effective in producing a\\nquality product. It is the responsibility of the auditor to note\\nthe specific problems caused by the procedure and/or standard and\\ninclude them in the report. In general, however, problems that\\nthe auditor identifies should be related to project or\\ncontractually-required procedures and standards; the auditor's\\nopinion of their desirability should not affect his/her\\nevaluation of the adherence to them.\\nD. Follow-up\\nWhile the auditor's role is essentially finished after producing\\nthe audit report, actions to resolve deficiencies identified in\\nthat report must be taken by project management. Problems that\\nare feasible and reasonable to correct should be converted to\\naction items and assigned to appropriate individuals. A\\nrationale should be developed for those that are not to be\\ncorrected. It is the responsibility of the developers to improve\\ntheir processes in response to deficiencies identified by the\\naudit. The changes should be tracked to ensure they occur and\\nare effective and the closure of action items should be\\ndocumented. In manycases, the best way to determine if the\\nproblems have been solved is through a follow-up audit.\\nIV. SQAAUDITSCHEDULING\\nA. Routine Scheduling\\nInternal SQAaudits should be scheduled frequently enough to\\nidentify potential problems so that no surprises develop for\\nproject management. They should be scheduled routinely during\\nthe life cycle, particularly around life cycle phase transitions.\\nThe most effective internal audit programs schedule frequent\\naudits of small areas of project activity. Frequent auditing,\\ncombined with other SQAmonitoring activities, would assure\\nproject managementhat the actual status of the project is\\nknown, vis-a-vis standards, procedures, and schedules.\\nExternal audits require more planning and interview time, but are\\nscheduled muchless frequently. The most important time for an\\nexternal SQAaudit is at the start of the implementation phase.\\nThis audit assures that the developer's standards and procedures\\nare implemented in a mannerappropriate for the project and that\\nthey are being followed. A second important time in a project's\\nlife cycle is the beginning of system integration. An external\\naudit helps to assure that the software is ready for integration,\\nthat test plans and procedures are in place, and that procedures\\nfor control of the software are not short-circuited. Projects\\nthat are in trouble or have no internal audit function should\\nhave more frequent external audits.\\nAnother factor to consider in the scheduling of audits, either\\ninternal or external, is the results of previous audits. Each\\nSQAaudit should include a review of the results and action items\\nfrom any previous audits to confirm closure. If there were a\\nnumberof problems and action items, audits should be scheduled\\nmore frequently. Projects that follow their procedures, meet\\ntheir standards, and are accurate in reporting schedule and\\nstatus need less frequent auditing.\\nB. SQAAudits in Responseto Warning Signs\\nSomeprojects mayshow indications of problems in the development\\nprocess. Whenwarning signs appear, the acquirer should consider\\nconducting an external audit as part of its response. The same\\nwarning signs can be used by the software provider to step up or\\nevaluate the effectiveness of its internal audit program.\\nThe audit program should be intensified if the project exhibits\\nany of the following signs:\\nFrequent schedule/milestone changes.\\n\\u2022 Inconsistency of the developer's organizational structure\\nwith original plans or apparent inconsistency with the structure\\nor functionality of the products to be produced.\\n\\u2022 Unexplained fluctuation of project staff level or under- or\\nover-staffing comparedto estimates.\\n\\u2022 Increases in the numberof TBDitems and action items\\nwithout adequate progress in solutions.\\n\\u2022 The inability or unwillingness of the developer to provide\\nadequate and accurate information on project status, schedules,\\nand plans.\\n\\u2022 Continual delay of scheduled software system capabilities to\\nlater releases/versions.\\n\\u2022 Unreasonable numbersof nonconformancesor change requests;\\nfor example, a large numberunresolved, or a sudden increase in\\nnumbers. An \\\"unreasonable number\\\" might be a suspiciously small\\namount of nonconformancesfor a complex system.\\nThere maybe other indications that are apparent to project\\nmanagementin specific cases. An experienced project manager's\\nintuition that something maybe wrong is a warning sign that\\nshould be heeded. An external audit is a cost effective way for\\nan acquirer to ascertain the real product status and real\\nprocesses being used by a developer; developer managementshould\\nhave an ongoing audit program to assure that no surprises are in\\nstore for them.\\nC. Announcing Audits\\nAdequate notification of audits should be provided to the\\ndevelopers for a numberof reasons. Unannounced(surprise)\\naudits are disruptive and demoralizing to the development staff\\nand should be avoided. The intent of an audit program should be\\nto help promote conformance with standards and procedures and the\\nreporting of accurate status, not to \\\"catch in the act\\\" those\\n\\\"guilty\\\" of violations. An announcedschedule of audits allows\\nproper preparation in terms of having required documentation\\navailable and being prepared to answer the auditor's questions.\\nV. SQAAUDITSDURINGTHESOFTWARELIFE CYCLE\\nA. Software Concept and Initiation Phase\\nDuring the concept and initiation phase, the software concept is\\ndeveloped, the feasibility of the software system is evaluated,\\nthe acquisition strategy is developed, and, if a contract is to\\nbe used to acquire the software, procurement is initiated and a\\ncontract is awarded. Before selecting an organization to perform\\na project, the acquiring organization can request a pre-award SQA\\naudit. The intent of this type of audit is slightly different\\nfrom audits performed later in the life cycle. Since there are\\nno activities underway on the software that is to be developed,\\nthe auditor can only review the provider's \\\"corporate\\\" or generic\\nstandards and procedures, and past projects. If possible, these\\nshould be examined in the context of the proposed project, so\\nthat their effectiveness can be judged. This type of audit\\nrequires an experienced auditor.\\nThe procedures and standards for the project are formulated\\nduring this phase. The SQA staff of the acquirer should ensure\\nthat standards and procedures adopted are appropriate for the\\nproject and are auditable, i.e., have a clear documentation\\ntrail, with easy-to-follow steps. They also should make sure\\nthat the contract allows external audits and requires internal\\naudits.\\nB. Software Requirements Phase\\nDuring the software requirements phase, the software concept and\\nallocated system requirements are analyzed and documented as\\nsoftware requirements. Test planning is begun, with a method for\\nverifying each requirement identified and included in a\\npreliminary test plan. Risks are identified and risk management\\ncontrol mechanisms are established. The size and scope of the\\nremainder of the project is reevaluated, and changes in resources\\nand schedules are made. Methods, standards, and procedures are\\ndetailed and put in place. The phase ends with a requirements\\nreview, at which the requirements are agreed to between the\\nacquirer and developer and put under CM.\\nInternal audits during this phase concentrate on the process of\\ndeveloping, documenting, and controlling the requirements. Some\\nprocess should be in place to control the requirements and draft\\ndocuments as they are developed. This process probably will be\\nrelatively informal, and may include NRCA and an action item\\ntracking system. There may be procedures for reporting on\\nprogress, estimating system and project resources, and risk\\nassessment. All of these can be audited to the extent that\\ncontrolled processes are in place. In addition to procedures,\\nauditors should verify that requirements documents follow the\\nformat specified in the documentation standard.\\nAn external audit, if one is performed during this phase, may\\nlook at the same items that are covered by an internal audit.\\naddition, an external audit can cover the same items as listed\\nfor a pre-award audit.\\nIn\\nC. Software Architectural Design Phase\\nThe objective of the architectural design phase is to develop an\\noverall design for the software, allocating all of the\\nrequirements to software components. The software requirements\\nare controlled and managed, and documents baselined following the\\nrequirements phase are changed only by a formal process. The\\nphase ends with the preliminary design review, during which the\\nacquirer and developer agree on the architecture of the system\\nthat is to be produced. Rework and action items resulting from\\nthe review are tracked and completed.\\nInternal and external audits during this phase should include the\\ndesign documentation, verifying that format standards are met.\\nThe auditor should assure that all requirements are being\\nallocated to software components. It is especially important to\\naudit the configuration control mechanisms for the requirements\\nto make sure that unauthorized and uncontrolled requirement\\nchange and growth is not occurring. In addition, items such as\\nthose mentioned in the previous phase, i.e., status reporting,\\naction item tracking, and nonconformance reporting should be\\naudited.\\nD. Software Detailed Design Phase\\nDuring the detailed design phase, the architectural design is\\nexpanded to the unit level. Interface control documents are\\ncompleted and test plans revised. Constraints and object system\\nresource limits are reestimated and analyzed, and staffing and\\ntest resources are validated. The phase ends with the critical\\ndesign review, and the detailed design is baselined.\\nAudits during this phase should focus on the progress and\\ndocumentation of the detailed design. If unit development\\nfolders (or other similar documentation) are used, they should be\\nstarted during this phase, and can be audited. As auditing is\\ndone, reported status should be compared with the actual status.\\nAny discrepancies should be noted. Both the requirements and the\\narchitectural design should be under CM and the CM process should\\nbe audited. Other items listed in the descriptions of the\\nprevious phases are still applicable.\\nE. Software Implementation Phase\\nDuring the implementation phase, the software is coded and unit\\ntested. All documentation is produced in quasi-final form,\\nincluding internal code documentation. At the end of the phase,\\nall required products should be ready for delivery, subject to\\nmodification during integration and testing. Audits during this\\nphase check the results of design and coding, CM activities and\\nprogram library, NRCA process, and schedule and status of the\\nproject.\\nInternal audits should be frequent during this phase. The\\nproject staff is usually at its maximum, and there are a great\\nnumber of simultaneous activities. SQA auditing is one of the\\nmore important ways for management to keep the process under\\ncontrol, assure that quality products are being developed, and\\nthat status is actually as reported. Completed products are\\nbeing sent to test as they are ready, and the products and their\\ncontrol process should be audited. Audits should include code\\naudits to makesure coding standards are being followed and that\\ninternal code documentation standards are met. If inspections or\\nsomeother form of peer reviews are done, the auditor should\\ncheck that they are completed on all products and that action\\nitems resulting from them are carried out.\\nAn external audit is most effective if done early in the\\nimplementation phase. At this point in the life cycle, all\\ncontrol procedures are in operation and all standards are in use.\\nThis external SQAaudit assures that they are being followed\\ncorrectly and that status is correctly reported. If any problems\\nare noted, it is early enough for meaningful change and\\ncorrective action.\\nm . Software Integration and Test Phase\\nThe objectives of the integration and test phase are to integrate\\nthe software units into a completed system, discover and correct\\nany nonconformances, and demonstrate that the system meets its\\nrequirements. The phase ending review is the test readiness\\nreview, during which the developer provides to the acquirer\\nevidence that the software system is ready for acceptance\\ntesting. During this phase, the test plan is executed, the\\ndocumentation is updated and completed, and the products are\\nfinalized for delivery.\\nDuring this phase, internal audits include any and all of the\\nitems in previous phases. However, internal audits should\\nconcentrate on assuring that product changes made to correct\\nnonconformances discovered during the testing are controlled,\\ncompleted, and documented. Audits of the CM and NRCA processes,\\nand computer program library are highly important. The SQA audit\\nshould include a check of the formal test procedures and the test\\nresults. Integration and test is often the most confusing and\\ntime-pressured part of a project, and there is a tendency to\\ndiscard standards and procedures due to this pressure.\\nExternal audits during this phase should concentrate on the same\\nitems as internal audits, with additional emphasis on assuring\\ncompleteness; that is, that testing has not been shortchanged in\\norder to meet schedules.\\nG. Software Acceptance and Delivery Phase\\nDuring the acceptance and delivery phase, the formal acceptance\\nprocedure is carried out. As a minimum, there is a requirements-\\ndriven demonstration of the software to show that it meets those\\nrequirements. The process also may include acquirer tests, field\\nusage, or other arrangements that are intended to assure that the\\nsoftware will function correctly in its intended environment.\\nThis phase is very much like the end of the previous phase, with\\nsystem tests being run, nonconformances noted, and corrections\\nbeing made to the software, documentation, and data bases. The\\nitems to be audited are similar, especially the CM and NRCA\\nprocesses.\\nH. Software Sustaining Engineering and Operations Phase\\nDuring this phase of the software life cycle, the software is\\nused to achieve the objectives for which it was acquired.\\nCorrections and modifications are madeto the software to sustain\\nits operational capabilities and to upgrade its capacity to\\nsupport its users. Software changes mayrange in scope from\\nsimple corrective action up to major modifications that require a\\nfull life cycle process.\\nInternal audits should respond to the extent and type of changes\\nbeing madeto the system. If there is only a low level of\\ncorrective action, then audits maybe limited to the CMand NRCA\\nprocedures and to verifying that quality is being maintained in\\nthe products. If substantial modifications are being made,\\nhowever, then a full or mini-life cycle should be in place and\\naudits should be performed as described for the appropriate\\nstage.\\nWhenlong term sustaining engineering is being performed, an\\nexternal audit should be done periodically to assure the acquirer\\nthat product quality is maintained and sustained. A minimumof\\none external audit per year is recommended;more if the level of\\nchange activity is high.\\nVI. PREPARINGA CHECKLIST\\nAn audit checklist is a list of items that the auditor intends to\\nexamine and questions the auditor intends to ask during the site\\nvisit portion of the audit. While a generic checklist maybe\\nused as a basis for all audits, better results will be achieved\\nif the generic checklist is tailored for each audit. Tailoring\\nconsists of choosing appropriate items or questions from the\\ngeneric checklist, expanding the level of detail, adding\\nadditional questions and topics, and changing the wording of the\\nquestions to fit the project's nomenclature. Information for\\ntailoring maycomefrom the contract requirements, organizational\\nstandards and practices, and results and action items from\\nprevious audits. Additional information to be considered for\\ntailoring should include the structure of the development\\norganization and project, life cycle phase, and audit focus.\\nIn developing the checklist, the auditor should be careful not to\\noverlook important information that appears to be obvious. For\\nexample, assuming the project has a product specification maybe\\nerroneous; adding that item to the checklist will help to assure\\nthat the information is confirmed.\\nA sample generic checklist, divided by topic, is provided in\\nAppendix B. Under each topic is a series of typical questions\\nthat should be addressed if that topic is going to be part of the\\naudit. To tailor this checklist, the auditor should determine\\nwhich topics apply to the audit and whether questions should be\\nanswered by interviews, examination of the software products and\\ndocuments, examination of records, or a combination of methods.\\nThe auditor then should sort the questions by the method that is\\nintended to be used to answer them, and further, by the precise\\nsource to be used. For example, questions about how CMoperates\\nmight be asked of the CMmanagerduring an interview, but someof\\nthose samequestions might be directed at the person who operates\\nthe project's computer program library. Answers to other CM\\nquestions might be found through an examination of the records of\\nthe CMprocess; still others by an examination of code and\\ndocumentation products.\\nAs muchas possible, questions should be phrased in terms of the\\nspecific project and organization being audited, and should use\\nthe namesand terms that the project uses. This tailoring will\\ntake somework on the part of the auditor, but this effort will\\nbe repaid by the fact that effective communication will be\\nestablished earlier.\\nThe parts of the tailored checklist that will be answered by an\\nexamination of records or products should be put on a form for\\nuse on-site. The form can be simple, but should allow space for\\nanswers to each question and additional comments. The form\\nshould, if possible, allow the checking of boxes or simple entry\\nof information.\\nAs the auditor proceeds with the site visit, the checklists and\\nforms can be completed with the information obtained. The\\nauditor must retain the flexibility to modify the forms or\\nquestions as information is gathered. Additional questions are\\nlikely to be suggested by answers given, and forms maynot have\\nbeen properly madein advance to record the real situation. It\\nis important to rememberthat the checklist and forms derived\\nfrom it are guides, and that the objective of the audit is to\\nunderstand and report on the actual state of affairs in the\\ndeveloping organization.\\nVII. AUDITINGIN THEABSENCEOFSTANDARDSANDPROCEDURES\\nAn auditor maybe asked to \\\"audit\\\" a project that lacks\\ndocumentedstandards and procedures, perhaps because of warning\\nsigns indicated in Chapter IV. Most often, this type of audit\\nwill be external to the project, even if the auditor is employed\\nby the developing organization, because a developer that does not\\nhave documentedstandards and procedures is unlikely to have an\\ninternal audit program.\\nAll projects generate code and documentation, but if there are no\\nwritten standards, the products will be in the style of the\\nindividual technical performers or their managers. All projects\\nhandle changes and problems, and test their software. The\\nmethods maybe somewhatad-hoc and dependent on the specific\\nindividuals involved in a specific case, but they do exist,\\ndocumentedor not. The role of the auditor is to discover and\\ndocument the \\\"standards\\\" and \\\"procedures\\\" that are actually\\nfollowed.\\nAfter the auditor has determined from interviews what \\\"standards\\\"\\nand \\\"procedures\\\" are followed, the rest of the audit can proceed\\nlike any other audit. That is, the auditor can follow the\\nprogress of control paths and determine the extent to which the\\nprocedures are followed versus the numberof exceptions that are\\nallowed. The auditor can sample the products and rate their\\nconformance to the (unwritten) standards.\\nThe auditor must gather enough information to evaluate the\\nsuitability and consistency of the unwritten standards and\\nprocedures. The auditor maybe experienced enough to do the\\nevaluation, or the auditor maywish to leave the evaluation to\\nthe managemento which he/she will report. In either case, the\\nauditor has to gather information on product quality, consistency\\nof application of the unwritten rules, the adequacy of testing\\nand reviews, and instances of confusion and/or error that may\\nhave resulted from uncertainty. This information is then used\\nfor evaluation.\\nVIII. QUALITIESOFANAUDITOR\\nThe major contribution of an internal or external auditor to\\nproject success is the collection and presentation of information\\nthat allows project managementa clear view of the product's\\nactual status and the actual compliance with standards and\\nprocedures. This requires an impartial auditor. In particular,\\nan internal auditor must rememberthat covering up problems, due\\nto feelings of empathy with the project staff or a desire to\\npresent the developer's organization in a good light, is\\ncounterproductive. Problems that are not brought to light will\\nnot be solved, and mayresult in muchlarger problems later in\\nthe life cycle.\\nA good auditor should have a basic understanding of the software\\ndevelopment life cycle and the products and processes involved in\\neach of its phases. If an auditor is expected to evaluate the\\nstandards and procedures used by the developer and to judge their\\nimpact on product quality and project schedule, then he/she needs\\nsignificant experience and background in software development and\\nsoftware management. It helps if the auditor is knowledgeable\\nabout the type of software being audited, and is aware of the\\nspecific software development procedures used in the project. It\\nis useful if the auditor is experienced or trained in auditing\\ntechniques.\\nIX. TECHNIQUESANDTOOLS\\nThe most frequently used tool for an SQAaudit is an audit\\nchecklist. The checklist must be tailored to the project to be\\naudited, as it provides a list of questions that must be answered\\nabout that particular project.\\nAutomated tools, either brought by the auditor or provided by the\\nproject, maybe used if compatible with the project's standards\\nand procedures. For example, the project mayhave a standards\\nchecker for code. The auditor can run the checker on a sample of\\nthe code, or can verify that the project runs the checker.\\nThe checklist tailoring and form-making process also maybe\\nassisted by keeping a generic checklist in a database or word\\nprocessor. The tailored information maythen be automatically\\ntransferred to a form or brought to the audit on a laptop\\ncomputer.\\nAPPENDIXA: SQAAUDITREPORT\\nThe following is the minimumcontent for an SQAaudit report.\\ni .

      "        \"abstract\": \"Internal and external food safety audits are conducted to assess the safety and quality of food including on-farm production, manufacturing practices, sanitation, and hygiene. Some auditors are direct stakeholders that are employed by food establishments to conduct internal audits, while other auditors may represent the interests of a second party purchaser or a third-party auditing agency. Some buyers conduct their own audits or additional testing, while some buyers trust the results of third-party audits or inspections. Third-party auditors, however, use various food safety audit standards and most do not have a vested interest in the products being sold. Audits are conducted under a proprietary standard, while food safety inspections are generally conducted within a legal framework. There have been many foodborne illness outbreaks linked to food processors that have passed third-party audits and inspections, raising questions about the utility of both. Supporters argue third-party audits are a way to ensure food safety in an era of dwindling economic resources. Critics contend that while external audits and inspections can be a valuable tool to help ensure safe food, such activities represent only a snapshot in time.

Some buyers conduct their own 49 audits or additional testing, while some buyers trust the results of third-party audits or 50 inspections.  Third-party auditors, however, use various food safety audit standards 51 and most do not have a vested interest in the products being sold. Audits are conducted 52 under a proprietary standard, while food safety inspections are generally conducted 53 within a legal framework. There have been many foodborne illness outbreaks linked to 54 food processors that have passed third-party audits and inspections, raising questions 55 about the utility of both. Supporters argue third-party audits are a way to ensure food 56 safety in an era of dwindling economic resources. Critics contend that while external 57 audits and inspections can be a valuable tool to help ensure safe food, such activities 58 represent only a snapshot in time. This paper identifies limitations of food safety 59 inspections and audits and provides recommendations for strengthening the system, 60 based on developing a strong food safety culture, including risk-based verification 61 steps, throughout the food safety system. 62  63 1.0 Introduction 64  65 Billions of meals are prepared safely each day throughout the world. The commercial 66 food system relies on audits and inspections to assess the practices and processes used 67 to by food producers at each step in the production chain. Yet when outbreaks of 68 foodborne illness happen, the results can be emotionally, physically and financially 69 devastating to the victims and the businesses involved. Many outbreaks involve firms 70 that have had their food production systems verified and received acceptable ratings 71 from food safety auditors or government inspectors. 72  73 Food safety audits and inspections are one activity used to verify that a food producer 74 or individual is following specific guidelines, requirements or rules. Audits involve a 75 \\u201csystematic and independent examination to determine whether quality/safety 76 activities and related results comply with planned arrangements and whether these 77 arrangements are implemented effectively and are suitable to achieve objectives\\u201d 78 (ANZFA, 2001; ANZFA was later morphed into Food Standards Australia New 79 Zealand). Planned arrangements, as defined by the Australia New Zealand Food 80 Authority are commonly referred to as standards within the food industry. The 81 difference between inspections and audits is that an inspection evaluates \\u201cconformity 82 by measuring, observing, testing or gauging the relevant characteristics\\u201d(ANZFA, 83 2001). Audits are one tool to help ensure adherence to recognized regulations and good 84 manufacturing practices. 85   86 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3  An audit of food safety practices, facilities, documentation and written procedures is 87 used to gather information regarding food production and processing practices being 88 followed by a particular producer, identifying areas for improvement and areas that are 89 deficient (ANZFA, 2001). Audit reports, in theory, serve as the \\u201ceyes and ears\\u201d for an 90 organization buying food from a supplier (Weise, 2010). There are several types of 91 audits, and a variety of audit organizations, each with their own unique or common 92 food safety guidelines.  93  94 Self-audits are internal audits performed by a food establishment itself.  These 95 businesses usually have a quality assurance team that leads the internal audits. These 96 internal audits may have good potential for reducing risk if the methods followed are 97 those outlined in widely accepted codes and risk assessment guidance documents. The 98 effectiveness of internal audits is also assessed during third-party audits. Second-party 99 audits are audits that a downstream company, or buyer, performs on their supplier. 100 Third-party audits are performed by an outside firm that usually focuses entirely on 101 verification or standard implementation to ensure that a buyer\\u2019s rules are being 102 followed (Costa, 2010). Third-party audits examine compliance with laws and codes of 103 practice as well as provide \\u201cinsight into management controls and supervision\\u201d (Costa, 104 2010).  105  106 2.0 The role of audits in food safety 107  108 Third-party audits are one part of a multi-factorial approach to food safety. The 109 popularity of third-party audits has increased corresponding to a shift in food safety 110 governance away from government regulation and inspection towards the 111 development of private food safety standards (Busch, 2011).   112  113 Standard setting organizations (e.g. International Organization for Standardization 114 (ISO) and the British Retail Consortium [BRC]) include industry consortia, private 115 voluntary associations and buyers.  There are many different food safety standards 116 available to food producers and manufacturers even within a single industry segment. 117 While the various standards are voluntary, demand by buyers essentially makes 118 certification or verification under these standards de facto mandatory for food 119 companies that want to continue to sell their product to major retailers (Busch, 2011). 120 This has created a system for enforcing food safety standards without significantly 121 increasing burden on taxpayers.  122  123 In addition, if a company such as Walmart wanted specific standards for a product, 124 even if it exceeded U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards, the company 125 would demand that from the auditor -- and get it (Prevor, 2009). 126  127 While inspectors play an active role in overseeing compliance, the burden for food 128 safety lies primarily with food producers (GAO, 2008). Inspection efforts, even if 129 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4  doubled, would not be enough to make sure every food item is safe. Third party audits 130 provide the data upon which certification and buying decisions are made, and are now 131 a popular choice for retailers who use them to push the responsibility (and costs) for 132 food safety and quality back on to the supplier (Steir, 2009). Audits are an attempt to 133 move beyond inspections that are point-in-time observations of activities and practices.  134 Audits focus on the procedures in place to achieve food safety outcomes and look for 135 evidence that they are being followed and are appropriate and capable of reducing risk.  136 There is also increasing focus on assessment of food safety culture and management 137 commitment to food safety.  138  139 Third-party audits also benefit individual companies and supply chains. It has been 140 argued that the best use of third-party audits is to focus on strengthening self-audit 141 methods and operational controls to achieve safer food (Costa, 2010).For some, it is a 142 genuine desire to improve food safety, quality and sanitation or a way to 143 solve/troubleshoot existing problems (Steir, 2009).  For others it is a potential marketing 144 advantage or a customer requirement. The effectiveness of these audits may link to the 145 motivation behind the audit.  It has been determined that creating a food safety culture 146 is imperative to an effective food safety risk management system (Powell et al., 2011; 147 Yiannas, 2008).  Companies with a strong food safety culture may be more likely to 148 obtain a third party audit because they want to improve operations, not just because of 149 customer demand.  Companies with a strong food safety culture are also likely to use 150 audit results as guidance and opportunity to improve their practices.  Audits -- first- 151 second- or third-party -- are another tool for companies to enhance safe food 152 production. 153  154 What is not clear is the role of third party audits in reducing the risk of contaminated 155 food reaching the marketplace and the ability of auditors to identify problems or high-156 risk operations.  The utility of third party audits has been examined in other industries 157 as well. A 10-year study on workplace safety on U.S. railroads found that high audit 158 scores partially correlated with improved legislative compliance but did not necessarily 159 correspond to improved safety performance (Peterson, 2001). This indicated there were 160 problems somewhere in the system and that the audit process was not necessarily valid 161 for that industry. 162  163 3.0 Limitations of audits 164  165 Audit systems, in their current form, have limitations in improving food safety.  There 166 are no current empirical evaluations that look at the correlation between audit scores 167 and foodborne illness outbreaks but there is a long and storied history of food safety 168 failures involving third-party audits. 169  170 Third-party audits are analogous in many ways to regulatory municipal inspections of 171 foodservice operations: the effectiveness of both audits and inspections is driven largely 172 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 5  by observational judgment and consistency of the inspector or auditor. Foodservice 173 inspection is a cornerstone of local public health, yet inspection scores can be poor 174 predictors of foodborne illness. Jones and colleagues (2004) examined over 160,000 175 inspections in Tennessee over seven years and found no difference between scores of 176 foodservices associated with outbreaks and those that were not. Similar results were 177 previously found in Miami-Dade county (Cruz et al., 2001). In Massachusetts, 178 researchers found that jurisdictions had different inspection criteria, and even within a 179 given jurisdiction, a risk to one inspector may not be a risk to another (DeNucci 2007). 180  181 Many foodborne illness outbreaks have been linked to farms, processors and retailers 182 that went through some form of audit certification. The January 2009 outbreak of 183 Salmonella Typhimurium linked to the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) has been 184 frequently cited as an example of a failure in the third party auditing system (Busch, 185 2011; Steir, 2009; Moss and Martin, 2009).  In  January, 2009 PCA recalled over 3,900 186 peanut butter and other peanut-containing products from more than 350 companies 187 (FDA, 2009b), 691 people were sickened and nine died across 46 U.S. states and in 188 Canada (CDC, 2009a). 189  190 Moss and Martin (2009) reported in the New York Times that an auditor with AIB was 191 responsible for evaluating the safety of products produced by PCA. The peanut 192 company knew in advance when the auditors were arriving. \\u201cThe overall food safety 193 level of this facility was considered to be: SUPERIOR,\\u201d the auditor concluded in his 194 March 27, 2008, report for AIB. A copy of the audit was obtained by the Times. AIB was 195 not alone in missing the trouble at the PCA plant in Blakely, Georgia. State inspectors 196 also found only minor problems.  This outbreak and others highlight some of the 197 limitations of both third party audits and government inspections which are included in 198 Table I below. 199  200 Table I \\u2013 Limitations of Third Party Audits 201 Audit Limitations Summary Example A snapshot in time Audits and inspections remain point-in-time assessments that represent a small fraction of food production time and volume. If conducted properly and the results acted upon, audits can reveal strengths and weaknesses in a food safety program, but cannot guarantee future performance. Further, auditors can only examine what a company provides, although skilled auditors know what to ask for and may be able to identify clues to systemic problems.   PCA outbreak, a federal team of investigators later uncovered a number of alarming signs at the peanut plant including testing records from the company itself that showed Salmonella in its products as far back as June 2007 (Martin, 2009) MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 6  Reliance on an effective standard The audit is only as effective as the standard against which the practices are being measured. Standards must be evidence-based, designed to address the commodity/product specific risks and practices and responsive to changing industry practices and new science as it becomes available. Cantaloupe outbreak, July 2011. Previous research had focused on Salmonella and current industry standards may not be robust enough to address risk from Listeria.   Effective audit tool The audit tool (or audit checklist) must be valid. There is no scientific basis for certification/validation in audits (Mahshie, 2009). There is high variability in the quality and reliability of audits and many different types of audit tools that vary in length, complexity, and style. A firm may pass some audits but still have a food safety risk factor Salmonella in eggs, Iowa, 2010, lead to 2,000 illnesses and the recall of 500 million eggs. DeCoster received a superior rating from AIB International, despite audit reports that are typically 10-20 pages and consider over 300 elements (AIB International, 2007). Auditor competence Audits require more than just a checklist, they require paying attention and thinking. The individual ability of an auditor has a significant impact on the outcome of the audit, most third-party audits look for objective evidence to assess compliance, but effective auditors must be able to assess risk, particularly in unique situations and synthesize the information provided to determine effectiveness of the food safety management system In the aftermath of the PCA outbreak, the competency of both the auditor and the auditing firm were criticized. The auditor of the PCA facility was an experienced auditor but was an expert in fresh produce and was not aware that peanuts were susceptible to Salmonella (Moss and Martin, 2009) Audit scope The audit scope must be broad enough to cover all operations, locations and products. When a company is presented with different price quotes they often choose the cheapest one, which is more likely the one with less audit time (Pronk, 2011). This reduces cost for the firm requesting the audit, and reduces the ability of the auditor to see all parts of a complex operation as well as the possibility of the auditor finding instances of non-compliance. On June 28, 2007, Veggie Booty snack food was linked to an outbreak of Salmonella. The plant that made Veggie Booty had received a rating of \\u201cexcellent\\u201d from AIB International, raising questions about the efficacy of auditors and audits, which, in this case and others, did not extend to ingredient suppliers (Moss & Martin, 2009).  Conflict of Interest Almost all food producers/retailers require their suppliers to pay for their own audits. A company receiving a poor audit may be unwilling to hire that auditor again. Even with safeguards in place, auditing bodies still must rely on the honesty of their auditors to declare potential conflicts Follow-up Auditors have no legal authority and cannot demand records, embargo products or close an operation (Costa, 2011). Neither the auditor nor the audited company is required to report non-compliances, even automatic failures, to regulatory agencies. If the buyer does not review the audit report closely, which is often the case (Prevor, 2011a), they may never know that their supplier had a serious non-conformance.  202 In response to some of the criticisms around third party audits and standards and the 203 growing number of private standards with no real oversight over their development, 204 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 7  the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) was launched in May, 2000. GFSI is a non-profit 205 foundation managed by the consumer goods forum (GFSI, 2012). GFSI is a 206 benchmarking system where \\u201call recognized schemes have a common foundation of 207 requirements which should provide consistent results, in regard to the common 208 requirements applied during the audit, but the benchmarked schemes cannot be 209 considered as equal\\u201d (GFSI, 2012). One objective of the initiative is to reduce costs 210 within the system by reducing the number of different audits a firm requires for their 211 different customers. The success of the GFSI approach has not been evaluated to date. 212  213  214 4.0 Improving audits and inspections 215  216 Food safety auditors and inspectors are an integral part of the food safety system, and 217 their use will expand in the future, for both domestic and imported foodstuffs. 218 Supporters of third-party audits argue this type of audit augments the efforts of food 219 regulatory agencies, such as FDA, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and 220 others.  221  222 Auditing can be helpful, in theory. Audit reports, are only useful if the purchaser or  223 food producer them reviews the results, understands the risks addressed by the 224 standards and makes risk-reduction decisions based on the results. From past examples, 225 there appears to be a disconnect between what auditors provide (a snapshot) and what 226 buyers believe they are doing (a full verification of product and process).  227  228 Third-party auditing can also assist regulatory agencies by providing the extra 229 assessment and data a regulatory agency might not be able to collect as often as 230 required \\u2013 but only if the data is shared with regulatory agencies. Audits and 231 inspections can assist in the development of a food safety culture by dictating criteria 232 for the sale of goods (Acheson, 2010). The training component for employees is another 233 use of audits in the daily implementation of food safety practices (AIB International, 234 2007). Third-party audits also provide \\u201cthousands of checks and balances to the food 235 supply system with no direct cost to taxpayers\\u201d (AIB International, 2007). However, 236 theory and practice can differ. 237  238 Critics see many problems with the general way third-party audits are currently 239 conducted and have described them as the equivalent of \\u201cmail-order diplomas\\u201d (Moss 240 & Martin, 2009).  As far as being the \\u201ceyes and ears\\u201d for a company buying from the 241 audited supplier, many problems are apparently missed during visits (Weise, 2010). 242 Heavy reliance on prescriptive checklists may increase auditor consistency, allow for 243 cost savings on training but also reduces their ability to assess risk. This ultimately 244 results in a pool of auditors that are poorly qualified to assess the risks associated 245 within individual operations. It is imperative for the food industry to aggressively take 246 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 8  corrective actions and make third-party audits and inspections more meaningful, more 247 accurate, and to fully enhance the safety of consumers. 248  249 Good auditors look beyond what is on their checklist and can synthesize the various 250 pieces of information they get to put together a clear picture of whether the operation is 251 doing what they say they are doing.  Certification bodies must also embrace a food 252 safety culture, ensuring their auditors have the appropriate training, oversight, 253 knowledge and support. 254  255 In an effort to improve the third party audit system, FDA is working to establish 256 accreditation programs under a new food safety law, to insure the quality of audits 257 (Karst, 2011). FDA is also trying to make audit results accessible so they can analyze the 258 results for effectiveness and reliability (Karst, 2011). FDA released guidance for industry 259 in 2009 regarding voluntary third-party certification programs for foods and feeds 260 (FDA, 2009a). In this document, it is clearly stated that industry has the primary 261 responsibility to ensure that food products are safe and meet FDA requirements. The 262 document outlines recommendations for third-party certification programs such as 263 qualifications and training for auditors including coursework and field training. These 264 recommendations, though helpful, are not \\u201clegally established responsibilities\\u201d and the 265 extensive use of the word \\u201cshould\\u201d in the document infers a recommendation rather 266 than a requirement (FDA, 2009a). 267  268 Third-party audits are only one performance indicator and need to be supplemented 269 with microbial testing, second-party audits of suppliers and the in-house capacity to 270 meaningfully assess the results of audits and inspections. Any and all raw product 271 suppliers should be included in the audit scope. More effective audit systems 272 incorporate unannounced visits along with supplemental information into their 273 framework and require extensive documentation of internal audits, regulatory 274 compliance, laboratory results and raw product certifications. 275  276 Preventive measures such as instilling and enhancing a food safety culture, where there 277 are shared values throughout the organization that support risk-reduction, may 278 improve the safety of the food supply by supplying daily reminders, incentives and 279 food safety priorities in the absence of inspectors or auditors. Improving and 280 encouraging communication with front-line employees \\u2013 any food producer is only as 281 good as its worst front-line staff \\u2013 can help mitigate high-risk situations such as at PCA, 282 where employees said the facility was \\u201ca dump,\\u201d but did not report their concerns to 283 officials before people became ill and died (Sharp, 2009). Audits, regulatory inspections 284 and testing are an important part of the food safety system, but alone and individually 285 they are not enough.  286  287 Education and training are the focus of many food handling behavior interventions. 288 However, research suggests that the impacts of food handler training programs are 289 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 9  often inconsistent, and program evaluation is rarely conducted (Almanza & Nesmith, 290 2004; Egan et al., 2007; Frash et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 2008). Measuring knowledge 291 change is a poor indicator of changes in practices.  Yiannas (2008) points out the 292 limitations of focusing entirely on training as food safety culture indicators and 293 suggests training is just one factor of a good organization. Conscientious proprietors 294 provide training and proper tools, remove barriers, and proceed with a focus on 295 positive food safety behavior. The lack of food safety expertise within an organization 296 to effectively evaluate and interpret audit or inspection results may compound 297 problems. Standards applied by auditing firms and regulatory inspections often include 298 training as a component, but outbreak history suggests that little evaluation of 299 effectiveness is explored. 300  301 Researchers have suggested that the only reliable measure of effectiveness of food 302 safety culture-supporting intervention material is through the observation of food 303 preparation practices (Redmond and Griffith, 2003; Anderson et al., 2004; Redmond et 304 al., 2004; Chapman et al., 2010).   305  306 In 2010, beef processor JBS started a trial using video cameras as part of their third-307 party monitoring and auditing efforts (Crews, 2011). Strategically placed cameras 308 recorded footage that could then be observed by auditors around-the-clock and random 309 audits could then be conducted remotely. Not only does this allow for immediate 310 feedback, it has also proven an effective training tool for employees, as they can observe 311 and learn from watching themselves at work (Crews, 2011). Improvement at the pilot 312 plant was seen in days instead of months and compliance rates consistently exceeded 313 99%. Errors can be addressed almost immediately before problems develop (Crews, 314 2011).   315  316 Assessing food-handling practices of staff through internal observations, externally-led 317 evaluations, and audit and inspection results can provide indicators of a food safety 318 culture. Results of these evaluations can be used to modify interventions and further 319 improve the organization\\u2019s culture of food safety (Mitchell et al, 2007). 320  321 Since most commercial food establishments are audited or inspected, it remains likely 322 that any food establishment that becomes associated with a foodborne illness outbreak 323 will have had some type of audit in the past.  Audits still do not guarantee safe food 324 and have inherent limitations based upon stakeholder involvement, auditor 325 competence, audit scope, and audit system.  326  327 In August 2008, Listeria monocytogenes-contaminated deli meats produced by Maple Leaf 328 Foods, Inc. of Canada caused 57 illnesses and 22 deaths (Weatherill, 2009). A panel of 329 international food safety experts convened by Maple Leaf Foods, Inc. to investigate the 330 source of the deli meat contamination determined that the most probable contamination 331 source was mechanical meat slicers that, despite cleaning according to the 332 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 10  manufacturer\\u2019s instructions, had meat residue trapped deep inside the slicing 333 mechanisms (Weatherill, 2009). An independent investigative review commissioned by 334 the Canadian federal government concluded that the focus on food safety was 335 insufficient among senior management at both the company and the various 336 government organizations involved before and during the outbreak; that insufficient 337 planning had been undertaken to be prepared for a potential outbreak; and that those 338 involved lacked a sense of urgency at the outset of the outbreak (Mason, 2009).  339  340 The specific plant linked to the outbreak received satisfactory marks from federal 341 inspectors for complying with federal regulatory requirements. They appeared to be 342 doing everything right. Employees consistently addressed instances of non-compliance 343 when they were identified. The plant\\u2019s management maintained all required records, 344 ensured that staff training took place, and ensured the established quality assurance 345 program was followed. At all plants, the company conducted environmental testing 346 that went beyond regulatory requirements (Weatherill, 2009).  Prior to the outbreak, 347 Maple Leaf Foods, Inc. conducted more than 3,000 environmental tests annually at the 348 implicated plant and tested products monthly (McCain, 2009). Although no product 349 tests revealed the presence of Listeria spp., a number of environmental samples detected 350 the bacteria in the months before the public was alerted in August to possible 351 contamination (CFIA, 2009; McCain, 2009). However, the company failed to recognize 352 and identify the underlying cause of a sporadic yet persistent pattern of environmental 353 test results that were positive for Listeria spp. and was not obliged to report these results. 354  355 The use of audits to help create, improve, and maintain a genuine food safety culture 356 holds the most promise in preventing foodborne illness and safeguarding public health. 357 A common thread in all of the outbreaks described above is a clear lack of food safety 358 culture among the implicated companies. In the E. coli outbreak in South Wales, a 359 public inquiry into the outbreak by Professor Hugh Pennington (2009) found that, in 360 addition to allowing cross contamination through the operation\\u2019s single vacuum 361 packaging machine, butcher William Tudor encouraged ill employees to continue 362 working in establishments and preparing meat for sale. Upon review of statements 363 made by employees and environmental health officers to the police, of video and 364 photographic evidence, and of management documentation, Professor Chris Griffith 365 (2010), head of the food research and consultancy unit at the University of Wales 366 Institute, Cardiff, told the inquiry the culture at the premises was one of little regard for 367 the importance of food safety but where making and saving money was the priority. 368 Health code violations at the abattoir were longstanding, repetitive and widely known 369 among environmental health officers responsible for inspecting the operation. Although 370 foodborne illness may not always be completely preventable, that the risk of a business 371 causing foodborne illness is, to a large extent, a consequence of its own activities. Audit 372 and inspection information must be leveraged into corrective actions to mitigate risk.   373  374 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 11  Food safety culture, not only within the company but also within a supply chain should 375 also be emphasized.  In both the Odwalla and PCA outbreaks, second-party audits were 376 able to identify problems the third party auditors did not.  Open communication 377 between suppliers and buyers including expectations and risk management practices is 378 essential.  Systems where retailers work with their suppliers to help them achieve 379 objectives have had somewhat better buy-in from suppliers and may achieve better 380 results because they reinforce that culture. (Rains, 2009; Steir, 2009).  381  382 Third-party auditing is a business, where an organization or business pays another firm 383 to verify whether a supplier is following agreed-upon standards.  While third-party 384 auditors are not in the same position as regulatory inspectors with respect to policing an 385 industry \\u2013 they can provide information upon which buyers can make decisions. Based 386 on historic examples, audit results have not been well understood by requiring buyers 387 (Griffith, 2010; Schmit, 2009). It is incumbent on auditing firms and food businesses 388 commissioning audits to understand the strengths and limitations of any evaluation 389 process. Companies who blame the auditor or inspector for outbreaks of foodborne 390 illness should also blame themselves. 391  392 References 393 Acheson, D. (2010.)

Some buyers conduct their own 49 audits or additional testing, while some buyers trust the results of third-party audits or 50 inspections.  Third-party auditors, however, use various food safety audit standards 51 and most do not have a vested interest in the products being sold. Audits are conducted 52 under a proprietary standard, while food safety inspections are generally conducted 53 within a legal framework. There have been many foodborne illness outbreaks linked to 54 food processors that have passed third-party audits and inspections, raising questions 55 about the utility of both. Supporters argue third-party audits are a way to ensure food 56 safety in an era of dwindling economic resources. Critics contend that while external 57 audits and inspections can be a valuable tool to help ensure safe food, such activities 58 represent only a snapshot in time. This paper identifies limitations of food safety 59 inspections and audits and provides recommendations for strengthening the system, 60 based on developing a strong food safety culture, including risk-based verification 61 steps, throughout the food safety system. 62  63 1.0 Introduction 64  65 Billions of meals are prepared safely each day throughout the world. Much of that food 66 is deemed safe by some form of verification of practices, known commonly in the 67 commercial food system as external audits or inspection. Yet when outbreaks of 68 foodborne illness happen, the results can be emotionally, physically and financially 69 devastating to the victims and the businesses involved. Many outbreaks involve firms 70 that have had their food production systems verified and received acceptable ratings 71 from food safety auditors or government inspectors. 72  73 Food safety audits and inspections are one activity used to verify that a food producer 74 or individual is following specific guidelines, requirements or rules. Audits involve a 75 \\u201csystematic and independent examination to determine whether quality/safety 76 activities and related results comply with planned arrangements and whether these 77 arrangements are implemented effectively and are suitable to achieve objectives\\u201d 78 (ANZFA, 2001; ANZFA was later morphed into Food Standards Australia New 79 Zealand). Planned arrangements, as defined by the Australia New Zealand Food 80 Authority are commonly referred to as standards within the food industry. The 81 difference between inspections and audits is that an inspection evaluates \\u201cconformity 82 by measuring, observing, testing or gauging the relevant characteristics\\u201d(ANZFA, 83 2001). Audits may be supplemented with microbiological and quality assurance 84 product testing and process inspections by regulatory agencies or industry to help 85 ensure adherence to recognized regulations and good manufacturing practices.  86 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3  Reactive investigations based on direct consumer complaints or concerns raised 87 through social media may provide additional information. 88   89 An audit of food safety practices, facilities, documentation and written procedures is 90 used to gather information regarding food production and processing practices being 91 followed by a particular producer, identifying areas for improvement and areas that are 92 deficient (ANZFA, 2001). Audit reports, in theory, serve as the \\u201ceyes and ears\\u201d for an 93 organization buying food from a supplier (Weise, 2010). There are several types of 94 audits, and a variety of audit organizations, each with their own unique or common 95 food safety guidelines.  96  97 Self-audits are internal audits performed by a food establishment itself.  These 98 businesses usually have a quality assurance team that leads the internal audits. These 99 internal audits may have good potential for reducing risk if the methods followed are 100 those outlined in widely accepted codes and risk assessment guidance documents. 101 Second-party audits are audits that a downstream company, or buyer, performs on their 102 supplier. Third-party audits are performed by an outside firm that usually focuses 103 entirely on verification or standard implementation to ensure that a buyer\\u2019s rules are 104 being followed (Costa, 2010). Third-party audits examine compliance with laws and 105 codes of practice as well as provide \\u201cinsight into management controls and 106 supervision\\u201d (Costa, 2010).  107  108 2.0 The role of audits in food safety 109  110 Third-party audits are one part of a multi-factorial approach to food safety. The 111 popularity of third-party audits has increased corresponding to a shift in food safety 112 governance away from government regulation and inspection towards the 113 development of private food safety standards (Busch, 2011).  Standard setting 114 organizations (e.g. International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the British 115 Retail Consortium (BRC)) include industry consortia, private voluntary associations 116 and buyers.  There are many different food safety standards available to food producers 117 and manufacturers even within a single industry segment. While the various standards 118 are voluntary, demand by buyers essentially makes certification or verification under 119 these standards de facto mandatory for food companies that want to continue to sell 120 their product to major retailers (Busch, 2011). This has created a system for enforcing 121 food safety standards with little burden on taxpayers.  122  123 Costa (2010) argues that third-party audits should focus on strengthening self-audit 124 methods and operational controls to achieve safer food and maximize benefits. The U.S. 125 Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted in a 2008 report that, while inspectors 126 or auditors play an active role in overseeing compliance, the burden for food safety lies 127 primarily with food producers (GAO, 2008). For example, Prevor (2011b) argues that if 128 a company such as Walmart wanted specific standards for a product, even if it exceeded 129 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards, the company would demand that 130 from the auditor -- and get it. Doering (2010) has also said responsibility for verification 131 primarily lies with industry, given that inspection efforts, even if doubled, would not be 132 enough to make sure every food item is safe. Third-party audits provide the data upon 133 which certification and buying decisions are made, and are now a popular choice for 134 retailers who use them to push the responsibility (and costs) for food safety and quality 135 back on to the supplier (Steir, 2009).  136  137 Third-party audits are relied upon within a single company or supply chain for a 138 number of reasons. For some, it is a genuine desire to improve food safety, quality and 139 sanitation or a way to solve/troubleshoot existing problems (Steir, 2009).  For others it is 140 a potential marketing advantage or a customer requirement.   The effectiveness of these 141 audits may link to the motivation behind the audit.  It has been determined that 142 creating a food safety culture is imperative to an effective food safety risk management 143 system (Powell et al., 2011; Yiannas, 2008).  Companies with a strong food safety culture  144 may be more likely to obtain a third party audit because they want to improve 145 operations, not just because of customer demand.  Companies with a strong food safety 146 culture are also likely to use audit results as guidance and opportunity to improve their 147 practices.  Audits -- first- second- or third-party -- are another tool for companies to 148 enhance safe food production. 149  150 What is not clear is the role of third party audits in reducing the risk of contaminated 151 food reaching the marketplace and the ability of auditors to identify problems or high 152 risk operations.  The utility of third party audits has been examined in other industries 153 as well. A 10-year study on workplace safety on U.S. railroads found that high audit 154 scores partially correlated with improved legislative compliance but did not necessarily 155 correspond to improved safety performance (Peterson, 2001). This indicated there were 156 problems somewhere in the system and that the audit process was not necessarily valid 157 for that industry. 158  159 3.0 Limitations of audits 160  161 Audit systems, in their current form, have limitations in improving food safety.  There 162 are no current empirical evaluations that look at the correlation between audit scores 163 and foodborne illness outbreaks but there is a long and storied history of food safety 164 failures involving third-party audits and inspections. 165  166 Third-party audits are analogous in many ways to regulatory municipal inspections of 167 foodservice operations: the effectiveness of both audits and inspections is driven largely 168 by observational judgment and consistency of the inspector or auditor. Foodservice 169 inspection is a cornerstone of local public health, yet inspection scores can be poor 170 predictors of foodborne illness. Jones and colleagues (2004) examined over 160,000 171 inspections in Tennessee over 7 years and found no difference between scores of 172 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 5  foodservices associated with outbreaks and those that were not. Similar results were 173 previously found in Miami-Dade county (Cruz et al., 2001). In Massachusetts, 174 researchers found that jurisdictions had different inspection criteria, and even within a 175 given jurisdiction, a risk to one inspector may not be a risk to another (DeNucci 2007). 176  177 Many foodborne illness outbreaks have been linked to farms, processors and retailers 178 that went through some form of audit certification. The January 2009 outbreak of 179 Salmonella Typhimurium linked to the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) has been 180 frequently cited as an example of a failure in the third party auditing system (Busch, 181 2011; Steir, 2009; Moss and Martin, 2009).  In  January, 2009 PCA recalled over 3,900 182 peanut butter and other peanut-containing products from more than 350 companies 183 (FDA, 2009b), 691 people were sickened and nine died across 46 U.S. states and in 184 Canada (CDC, 2009a). 185  186 Moss and Martin (2009) reported in the New York Times that an auditor with AIB was 187 responsible for evaluating the safety of products produced by PCA. The peanut 188 company knew in advance when the auditors were arriving. \\u201cThe overall food safety 189 level of this facility was considered to be: SUPERIOR,\\u201d the auditor concluded in his 190 March 27, 2008, report for AIB. A copy of the audit was obtained by the Times. AIB was 191 not alone in missing the trouble at the PCA plant in Blakely, Georgia. State inspectors 192 also found only minor problems.  This outbreak and others highlight some of the 193 limitations of both third party audits and government inspections which are included in 194 Table I below. 195  196  197 The Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) is a non-profit foundation managed by the 198 consumer goods forum (GFSI, 2012) and was launched in May 2000 as a response to the 199 growing number of private standards. GFSI is a benchmarking system where \\u201call 200 recognized schemes have a common foundation of requirements which should provide 201 consistent results, in regard to the common requirements applied during the audit, but 202 the benchmarked schemes cannot be considered as equal\\u201d (GFSI, 2012). One objective of 203 the initiative is to reduce costs within the system by reducing the number of different 204 audits a firm requires for their different customers. The success of the GFSI approach 205 has not been evaluated to date. 206  207 Some auditing companies and standards owners are trying to prevent situations where 208 a company may have a food safety problem but still obtain a passing grade, through the 209 application of mandatory or automatic failures (Steir, 2009). The use of auto-failures in 210 an audit is becoming more common.   High-risk activities are identified, such as the 211 quality of water used for washing fresh produce, and if the producer is not compliant 212 with those items, they fail the audit regardless of the final score. Many standards also 213 allow the auditor to suggest an auto-failure if they identify and document any situation 214 they deem to be an immediate food safety risk (CanadaGAP, 2012). 215 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 6   216 Audit vs Inspections 217 Government inspectors have also failed to prevent foodborne illness outbreaks. Five-218 year-old Mason Jones was one of 157 people \\u2013 primarily children \\u2013 who became ill in an 219 outbreak in South Wales caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7 in September 2005. The 220 outbreak was traced to the consumption of cooked meats provided to schools by John 221 Tudor & Son, a catering butcher business. A packaging machine at the business, used 222 for both raw and cooked meats, was identified as the probable source of contamination 223 \\u2013 where E. coli O157:H7 was most likely transferred from raw meat to cooked meat and 224 was then distributed to four authorities in South Wales for their school meal programs. 225 Ultimately, 31 people were admitted to hospital and, tragically, Mason Jones died. 226  227 Following the Wales outbreak, a number of mistakes and shortcomings by 228 environmental health officers were identified \\u2013 which in no way lessened the primary 229 responsibility on the supplier of contaminated food --  including the failure of one 230 officer to verify claims that all food handlers had food hygiene certificates and the 231 failure by another to insist that steps be taken to prevent cross contamination between 232 raw and cooked meats during vacuum packaging (Pennington, 2009). Brian Curtis, a 233 retired senior U.K. Food Standards Agency official, told the inquiry that the Hazard 234 Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan reportedly used by John Tudor & Son, 235 and reviewed by Mr. Curtis at the time of the inquiry, would not ensure the production 236 of safe food. Mr. Curtis faulted environmental health officers for failing to identify the 237 deficiencies and weaknesses in the HACCP plan, and for failing to identify and address 238 the poor hygiene and unsafe food handling practices at the facility. In addition, utilizing 239 announced, as opposed to unannounced, inspections allowed the butcher to falsify 240 backlogged cleaning records before such records were due to be viewed by 241 environmental health officers (Pennington, 2009). 242  243  244 In Sept. 2006, 199 people were sickened and at least three died from consumption of 245 bagged spinach contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 and produced by Earthbound Farms 246 of California. Samples of river water, wild pig feces, and cattle feces from a nearby 247 grass-fed cattle operation tested positive for the outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 248 (California Food Emergency Response Team, 2007).  Following the outbreak it was 249 revealed that the suspect facilities had received a third-party audit of their good 250 agricultural practices (GAPs) from auditor Primus Labs that did not raise concerns for 251 the buyer, Dole Foods, to alter any purchasing decisions. This was the 29th documented 252 outbreak of foodborne illness involving leafy greens in the U.S. Despite decades of 253 letters and pleading by regulators to the industry to improve microbiological safety 254 standards, there was no verification that farmers and others in the farm-to-fork food 255 safety system were seriously incorporating and acting on risk reduction messages, 256 especially in production fields rather than just processing facilities (Powell et al., 2009). 257  258 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 7   259 4.0 Improving audits and inspections 260  261 Food safety auditors and inspectors are an integral part of the food safety system, and 262 their use will expand in the future, for both domestic and imported foodstuffs. 263 Supporters of third-party audits argue this type of audit augments the efforts of food 264 regulatory agencies, such as FDA, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and 265 others.  266  267 Auditing can be helpful, in theory. Audit reports, are only useful if the purchaser who 268 requires them reviews the results, understands the risks addressed by the standards 269 and makes risk-reduction decisions based on the results. From past examples, there 270 appears to be a disconnect between what auditors provide (a snapshot) and what 271 buyers believe they are doing (a full verification of product and process).  272  273 Third-party auditing can also assist regulatory agencies by providing the extra 274 assessment and data a regulatory agency might not be able to collect as often as 275 required \\u2013 but only if the data is shared with regulatory agencies. Audits and 276 inspections can assist in the development of a food safety culture by dictating criteria 277 for the sale of goods (Acheson, 2010). The training component for employees is another 278 use of audits in the daily implementation of food safety practices (AIB International, 279 2007). Third-party audits also provide \\u201cthousands of checks and balances to the food 280 supply system with no direct cost to taxpayers\\u201d (AIB International, 2007). However, 281 theory and practice can differ. 282  283 Critics see many problems with the general way third-party audits are currently 284 conducted and have described them as the equivalent of \\u201cmail-order diplomas\\u201d (Moss 285 & Martin, 2009).  As far as being the \\u201ceyes and ears\\u201d for a company buying from the 286 audited supplier, many problems are apparently missed during visits (Weise, 2010).  287 It is imperative for the food industry to aggressively take corrective actions and make 288 third-party audits and inspections more meaningful, more accurate, and to fully 289 enhance the safety of consumers. 290  291 In an effort to improve the third party audit system, FDA is working to establish 292 accreditation programs under a new food safety law, to insure the quality of audits 293 (Karst, 2011). FDA is also trying to make audit results accessible so they can analyze the 294 results for effectiveness and reliability (Karst, 2011). FDA released guidance for industry 295 in 2009 regarding voluntary third-party certification programs for foods and feeds 296 (FDA, 2009a). In this document, it is clearly stated that industry has the primary 297 responsibility to ensure that food products are safe and meet FDA requirements. The 298 document outlines recommendations for third-party certification programs such as 299 qualifications and training for auditors including coursework and field training. These 300 recommendations, though helpful, are not \\u201clegally established responsibilities\\u201d and the 301 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 8  extensive use of the word \\u201cshould\\u201d in the document infers a recommendation rather 302 than a requirement (FDA, 2009a). 303  304 Third-party audits are only one performance indicator and need to be supplemented 305 with microbial testing, second-party audits of suppliers and the in-house capacity to 306 meaningfully assess the results of audits and inspections. Any and all raw product 307 suppliers should be included in the audit scope. More effective audit systems 308 incorporate unannounced visits along with supplemental information into their 309 framework and require extensive documentation of internal audits, regulatory 310 compliance, laboratory results and raw product certifications. 311  312 Preventive measures such as instilling and enhancing a food safety culture, where there 313 are shared values throughout the organization that support risk-reduction, may 314 improve the safety of the food supply by supplying daily reminders, incentives and 315 food safety priorities in the absence of inspectors or auditors. Improving and 316 encouraging communication with front-line employees \\u2013 any food producer is only as 317 good as its worst front-line staff \\u2013 can help mitigate high-risk situations such as at PCA, 318 where employees said the facility was \\u201ca dump,\\u201d but did not report their concerns to 319 officials before people became ill and died (Sharp, 2009). Audits, regulatory inspections 320 and testing are an important part of the food safety system, but alone and individually 321 they are not enough.  322  323 Education and training are the focus of many food handling behavior interventions. 324 However, research suggests that the impacts of food handler training programs are 325 often inconsistent, and program evaluation is rarely conducted (Almanza & Nesmith, 326 2004; Egan et al., 2007; Frash et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 2008). Measuring knowledge 327 change is a poor indicator of changes in practices.  Yiannas (2008) points out the 328 limitations of focusing entirely on training as food safety culture indicators and 329 suggests training is just one factor of a good organization. Conscientious proprietors 330 provide training and proper tools, remove barriers, and proceed with a focus on 331 positive food safety behavior. The lack of food safety expertise within an organization 332 to effectively evaluate and interpret audit or inspection results may compound 333 problems. Standards applied by auditing firms and regulatory inspections often include 334 training as a component, but outbreak history suggests that little evaluation of 335 effectiveness is explored. 336  337 Researchers have suggested that the only reliable measure of effectiveness of food 338 safety culture-supporting intervention material is through the observation of food 339 preparation practices (Redmond and Griffith, 2003; Anderson et al., 2004; Redmond et 340 al., 2004; Chapman et al., 2010).   341  342 In 2010, beef processor JBS started a trial using video cameras as part of their third-343 party monitoring and auditing efforts (Crews, 2011). Strategically placed cameras 344 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 9  recorded footage that could then be observed by auditors around-the-clock and random 345 audits could then be conducted remotely. Not only does this allow for immediate 346 feedback, it has also proven an effective training tool for employees, as they can observe 347 and learn from watching themselves at work (Crews, 2011). Improvement at the pilot 348 plant was seen in days instead of months and compliance rates consistently exceeded 349 99%. Errors can be addressed almost immediately before problems develop (Crews, 350 2011).   351  352 Assessing food-handling practices of staff through internal observations, externally-led 353 evaluations, and audit and inspection results can provide indicators of a food safety 354 culture. Results of these evaluations can be used to modify interventions and further 355 improve the organization\\u2019s culture of food safety (Mitchell et al, 2007). 356  357 Since most commercial food establishments are audited or inspected, it remains likely 358 that any food establishment that becomes associated with a foodborne illness outbreak 359 will have had some type of audit in the past.  Audits provide only a snap-shot of 360 information and have inherent limitations based upon stakeholder involvement, 361 auditor competence, audit scope, and audit system.  362  363 In August 2008, Listeria monocytogenes-contaminated deli meats produced by Maple Leaf 364 Foods, Inc. of Canada caused 57 illnesses and 22 deaths (Weatherill, 2009). A panel of 365 international food safety experts convened by Maple Leaf Foods, Inc. to investigate the 366 source of the deli meat contamination determined that the most probable contamination 367 source was mechanical meat slicers that, despite cleaning according to the 368 manufacturer\\u2019s instructions, had meat residue trapped deep inside the slicing 369 mechanisms (Weatherill, 2009). An independent investigative review commissioned by 370 the Canadian federal government concluded that the focus on food safety was 371 insufficient among senior management at both the company and the various 372 government organizations involved before and during the outbreak; that insufficient 373 planning had been undertaken to be prepared for a potential outbreak; and that those 374 involved lacked a sense of urgency at the outset of the outbreak (Mason, 2009).  375  376 The specific plant linked to the outbreak received satisfactory marks from federal 377 inspectors for complying with federal regulatory requirements. They appeared to be 378 doing everything right. Employees consistently addressed instances of non-compliance 379 when they were identified. The plant\\u2019s management maintained all required records, 380 ensured that staff training took place, and ensured the established quality assurance 381 program was followed. At all plants, the company conducted environmental testing 382 that went beyond regulatory requirements (Weatherill, 2009).  Prior to the outbreak, 383 Maple Leaf Foods, Inc. conducted more than 3,000 environmental tests annually at the 384 implicated plant and tested products monthly (McCain, 2009). Although no product 385 tests revealed the presence of Listeria spp., a number of environmental samples detected 386 the bacteria in the months before the public was alerted in August to possible 387 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 10  contamination (CFIA, 2009; McCain, 2009). However, the company failed to recognize 388 and identify the underlying cause of a sporadic yet persistent pattern of environmental 389 test results that were positive for Listeria spp. and was not obliged to report these results. 390  391 Audit and inspection information must be leveraged into corrective actions in order to 392 mitigate risk.  However, the use of audits to help create, improve, and maintain a 393 genuine food safety culture holds the most promise in preventing foodborne illness and 394 safeguarding public health. 395  396 A common thread in all of the outbreaks described above is a clear lack of food safety 397 culture among the implicated companies. In the E. coli outbreak in South Wales, a 398 public inquiry into the outbreak by Professor Hugh Pennington (2009) found that, in 399 addition to allowing cross contamination through the operation\\u2019s single vacuum 400 packaging machine, butcher William Tudor encouraged ill employees to continue 401 working in establishments and preparing meat for sale. Upon review of statements 402 made by employees and environmental health officers to the police, of video and 403 photographic evidence, and of management documentation, Professor Chris Griffith 404 (2010), head of the food research and consultancy unit at the University of Wales 405 Institute, Cardiff, told the inquiry the culture at the premises was one of little regard for 406 the importance of food safety but where making and saving money was the priority. 407 Health code violations at the abattoir were longstanding, repetitive and widely known 408 among environmental health officers responsible for inspecting the operation Although 409 foodborne illness may not always be completely preventable, Griffith (2010) concluded 410 that the risk of a business causing foodborne illness is, to a large extent, a consequence 411 of its own activities. 412  413 Food safety culture, not only within the company but also within a supply chain should 414 also be emphasized.  In both the Odwalla and PCA outbreaks, second-party audits were 415 able to identify problems the third party auditors did not.  Open communication 416 between suppliers and buyers including expectations and risk management practices is 417 essential.  Systems where retailers work with their suppliers to help them achieve 418 objectives have had somewhat better buy-in from suppliers and may achieve better 419 results because they reinforce that culture. (Rains, 2009; Steir, 2009).  420  421 Third-party auditing is a business, where an organization or business pays another firm 422 to verify whether a supplier is following agreed-upon standards.  While third-party 423 auditors are not in the same position as regulatory inspectors with respect to policing an 424 industry \\u2013 they can provide information upon which buyers can make decisions. Based 425 on historic examples, audit results have not been well understood by requiring buyers 426 (Griffith, 2010; Schmit, 2009). It is incumbent on auditing firms and food businesses 427 commissioning audits to understand the strengths and limitations of any evaluation 428 process. Companies who blame the auditor or inspector for outbreaks of foodborne 429 illness should also blame themselves. 430 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 11   431 References 432 Acheson, D.

If conducted properly and the results acted upon, audits can reveal strengths and weaknesses in a food safety program, but cannot guarantee future performance. Further, auditors can only examine what a company provides, although skilled auditors know what to ask for and may be able to identify clues to systemic problems.   PCA outbreak, a federal team of investigators later uncovered a number of alarming signs at the peanut plant including testing records from the company itself that showed Salmonella in its products as far back as June 2007 (Martin, 2009) MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTReliance on an effective standard The audit is only as effective as the standard against which the practices are being measured. Standards must be evidence-based, designed to address the commodity/product specific risks and practices and responsive to changing industry practices and new science as it becomes available. Cantaloupe outbreak, July 2011. Previous research had focused on Salmonella and current industry standards may not be robust enough to address risk from Listeria.   Effective audit tool The audit tool (or audit checklist) must be valid. There is no scientific basis for certification/validation in audits (Mahshie, 2009). There is high variability in the quality and reliability of audits and many different types of audit tools that vary in length, complexity, and style. A firm may pass some audits but still have a food safety risk factor Salmonella in eggs, Iowa, 2010, lead to 2,000 illnesses and the recall of 500 million eggs. DeCoster received a superior rating from AIB International, despite audit reports that are typically 10-20 pages and consider over 300 elements (AIB International, 2007). Auditor competence Audits require more than just a checklist, they require paying attention and thinking. The individual ability of an auditor has a significant impact on the outcome of the audit, most third-party audits look for objective evidence to assess compliance, but effective auditors must be able to assess risk, particularly in unique situations and synthesize the information provided to determine effectiveness of the food safety management system In the aftermath of the PCA outbreak, the competency of both the auditor and the auditing firm were criticized. The auditor of the PCA facility was an experienced auditor but was an expert in fresh produce and was not aware that peanuts were susceptible to Salmonella (Moss and Martin, 2009) Audit scope The audit scope must be broad enough to cover all operations, locations and products. When a company is presented with different price quotes they often choose the cheapest one, which is more likely the one with less audit time (Pronk, 2011). This reduces cost for the firm requesting the audit, and reduces the ability of the auditor to see all parts of a complex operation as well as the possibility of the auditor finding instances of non-compliance. On June 28, 2007, Veggie Booty snack food was linked to an outbreak of Salmonella. The plant that made Veggie Booty had received a rating of \\u201cexcellent\\u201d from AIB International, raising questions about the efficacy of auditors and audits, which, in this case and others, did not extend to ingredient suppliers (Moss & Martin, 2009).  Conflict of Interest Almost all food producers/retailers require their suppliers to pay for their own audits. A company receiving a poor audit may be unwilling to hire that auditor again. Even with safeguards in place, auditing bodies still must rely on the honesty of their auditors to declare potential conflicts Follow-up Auditors have no legal authority and cannot demand records, embargo products or close an operation (Costa, 2011). Neither the auditor nor the audited company is required to report non-compliances, even automatic failures, to regulatory agencies. If the buyer does not review the audit report closely, which is often the case (Prevor, 2011a), they may never know that their supplier had a serious non-conformance.  \",\n",

Food safety technology can \\nincrease a company\\u2019s capacity to prevent a foodborne contamination. A food \\nsafety audit\\u2014a quality control tool in which an auditor observes whether a \\nplant\\u2019s processing practices and technologies are compatible with good food \\nsafety practices\\u2014can indicate how effectively food safety technology is \\nbeing used. Fast food restaurants, grocery stores, and other major customers \\nof meat and poultry processing plants conduct their own audits or hire audi-\\ntors to assess the soundness of a plant\\u2019s processing operation. Meat and \\npoultry plants also can audit themselves as a way to help maintain process \\ncontrol and as a marketing tool. In this report, we document the extent of \\nfood safety audits in U.S. meat and poultry processing plants and examine \\nthe association between the use of audits and plant size, firm structure, and \\nfood safety technology use. \\nWhat Were the Study Findings?\\n\\u2022\\tIn the poultry slaughter, cattle slaughter, and ready-to-eat products (e.g., \\nluncheon meats) industries, at least 90 percent of output is from audited \\nplants. \\n\\u2022\\tIn the hog slaughter, ground beef, and not-ready-to-eat products (e.g., \\nmeat cuts) industries, at least 70 percent of output is from audited plants. \\n\\u2022\\tMore than one-half of all plants were audited in the poultry slaughter \\nindustry. About one out of three cattle slaughter and hog slaughter plants \\nwere audited.\\n\\u2022\\tPlants with customer-hired or plant-hired auditors use significantly higher \\nlevels of food safety technology than plants without auditors. The most \\nnotable differences between plants using auditors and those not using \\nauditors were in the use of testing and equipment technologies, and the \\nsmallest differences were observed in sanitation practices. These results \\nhold within plant size categories.\\n\\u2022\\tThe use of double audits may indicate firms with the strongest incentives \\nto maintain food safety. Double-audit plants\\u2014those using both plant-hired \\nand customer-hired auditors\\u2014use greater food safety technology than \\nplants using only one audit type (either plant-hired or customer-hired). \\nThese results hold after controlling for plant size. \\n\\u2022\\tLarger plants and plants owned by multiplant firms are associated with a \\nsignificantly higher level of food safety technology use across all indus-\\ntries that were examined. \\nHow Was the Study Conducted?\\nFood safety technology use in six categories of meat and poultry plants\\u2014\\ncattle, hog, and poultry slaughter; ready-to-eat (e.g., luncheon meats); \\nnot-ready-to-eat (e.g., meat cuts); and ground beef\\u2014is examined using a \\ntechnology index developed by Ollinger, Moore, and Chandran (2004) and v \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nusing Tukey-Kramer comparison tests and other statistical tools. Six technol-\\nogies were examined: hide removal (dehiding), sanitation, operations, equip-\\nment, testing, and an overall measure. The data on the use of food safety \\ntechnologies are nationally representative and include information on 600 \\nslaughter plants and 700 processing-only meat and poultry plants collected \\nby RTI International for USDA\\u2019s Food Safety Inspection Service in 2004 and \\n2005. They are the most recent data available. 1 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nIntroduction\\nFood safety audits provide information about the efficacy of a plant\\u2019s food \\nsafety process control system at some point in time and are becoming \\nincreasingly important to the meat and poultry industry.1 Fast food restau-\\nrants, grocery stores, and other major customers of meat and poultry plants \\nuse audits to assess the soundness of a plant\\u2019s processing operation and often \\nrequire audits as conditions for granting a plant their business. Meat and \\npoultry plants use audits as a way to help maintain process control and also \\nas a marketing tool that could be useful for winning more business (Richard, \\n2003). By 2005, the use of auditors had become widespread. Some recent \\nfood safety incidents, however, have called into the question the usefulness \\nof audits. Moss and Martin (2009) and Harris (2010) reported that several \\nrecently audited plants had recalled millions of dollars worth of peanut, meat, \\negg, and other products.\\nThe 1993 outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in hamburgers served at Jack-in-\\nthe-Box restaurants led to a loss in net income for the restaurant company of \\naround $160 million over the 18 months following the outbreak (Roberts et \\nal., 1997). In response, Jack-in-the-Box imposed strict food safety standards \\non its suppliers and became a leader in the provision of food safety (Golan \\net al., 2004). Other restaurant chains, grocery stores, food manufacturers, \\nand other buyers also recognized the threat that an adverse food safety event \\ncould pose to their business. Thus, they developed their own food safety \\nprocess control programs and hired food safety auditors to evaluate their \\neffectiveness.\\nAudits may complement food safety technology. While the amount of invest-\\nment in food safety technology indicates a company\\u2019s commitment to food \\nsafety and also its capacity to prevent foodborne contamination, food safety \\naudits can indicate how effectively food safety technology is being used.\\nTo date, there has been little research on the use of audits and their relation-\\nship with food safety technology in meat and poultry plants. Although the \\nuse of auditors does not necessarily cause plants to use more food safety \\ntechnology or vice versa, an association may exist between the use of audi-\\ntors and food safety technology, particularly if plants using auditors are the \\ntypes of plants that make more extensive use of food safety investments or \\nif the forces encouraging the use of food safety auditors encourage the use \\nof food safety technologies. Our purpose in this paper is to (1) examine the \\nextent of food safety audit use, (2) see whether the use of audits varies with \\nplant size and across industries, and (3) evaluate whether the use of audits, \\nplant size, and firm type are associated with food safety technology use. \\nOur analysis relies on data from a 2004-05 national survey of meat and \\npoultry plants by RTI International for USDA\\u2019s Food Safety Inspection \\nService (FSIS) on the use of food safety technologies. Altogether, nearly 400 \\nmeat slaughter, more than 200 poultry slaughter, and almost 700 processing-\\nonly plants responded to a survey that was sent to a nationally representa-\\ntive sample of plants. The survey covered an extensive array of food safety \\ntechnologies. Some of these are more labor-intensive food safety tasks, such \\nas sanitation practices, and others are fixed assets, such as steam vacuum \\n1The terminology surrounding food \\nsafety audits can be confusing. In the \\ncertification literature, a first-party \\naudit is an audit performed within \\nthe meat or poultry plant by the plant \\nitself; a second-party audit is an audit \\nconducted by or on behalf of a purchas-\\ning organization, such as a grocery \\nstore chain or another meat or poultry \\nplant; a third-party audit is undertaken \\nby an independent certification body \\nthat certifies a process and has no ties \\nto either the customer or the supplier. In \\nthe trade literature, a third-party auditor \\nis often referred to as an auditor who \\nis not an employee of the plant or cus-\\ntomer. To avoid confusion, we do not \\nuse the first-, second-, and third-party \\naudit terminology.2\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nunits. The survey also gathered information on plant characteristics, such as \\nproduct inputs and outputs, plant size, and firm type. \\nWe measure plant food safety technology using an index that is constructed \\nfrom the food safety technology questions included in the RTI International \\nsurvey. There is one comprehensive measure of all technologies and separate \\nindexes for five technology types\\u2014hide removal (dehiding), sanitation, oper-\\nating practices such as disposal of scrap products (operations), equipment, \\nand testing. By using five specialized technology indexes that separate labor-\\nintensive food safety activities, such as sanitation, from capital-intensive food \\nsafety measures, such as equipment, we can better understand how types of \\ntechnologies vary with plant characteristics. Indexes were based on a more \\ncomprehensive assortment of food safety technologies than was available for \\nOllinger, Moore, and Chandran (2004). \\nWe next discuss food safety audits and then provide an economic framework \\nof how incentives provided by the private market (e.g., major customers) \\nencourage food safety. After that, we discuss the survey methodology, \\ndescribe the data in more detail, and present results of food safety expendi-\\ntures and technological choices in the context of our model.3 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nTypes of Audits and Reasons for Using Them\\nAudits of manufacturing plants are a systematic documentation of the \\nextent to which a plant meets specific standards established by the plant or a \\ncustomer. There are many types of audits, but most fall into these categories: \\nfood safety and good manufacturing practices (GMPs), hazard analysis and \\ncritical control points (HACCP) verification (including benchmarking and \\nconfirming a program), animal welfare, good laboratory practices (GLPs), \\nand quality systems. Auditors may also evaluate document management \\nsystems, pest control practices, water and hygiene controls, corrective and \\npreventive procedures, purchasing and vendor practices, system calibrations, \\nallergen controls, shipping and receiving procedures, education and training \\nsystems, and sanitation practices (Stier, 2009).\\nAudits indicate whether a plant is performing specified functions on a partic-\\nular day. There is no guarantee that the plant will be performing the same \\nway on other days, so it is important that audits be scheduled on a frequent \\nbut random basis. If the auditor comes at a predictable time, there is an incen-\\ntive for plant management to prepare for an audit.\\nAudits cover a prescribed set of activities or processes. Plants receive a \\nfavorable rating if they meet those standards. A favorable rating does not \\nmean that a plant produces safe food. A plant could be producing contami-\\nnated products, yet it could receive a good rating from its auditor. For \\nexample, if the auditor was only obligated to evaluate employee sanitation \\nand the auditor determined that employees properly washed their hands, then \\nthe plant would earn a good rating even if the plant was producing contami-\\nnated products. Cases like this have occurred. Michael Moss and Andrew \\nMartin (2009) indicated that Peanut Corporation of America produced \\nSalmonella-contaminated peanuts for many months even though the plant \\nreceived superior auditing scores from AIB International, an auditing \\ncompany. Lena Sun (2010) reported that Wright County Farms received a \\nsuperior rating from AIB shortly before its eggs sickened more than 1,800 \\npeople. Since the AIB auditors of these establishments did no product testing, \\nthe auditors could not evaluate product food safety, and, since the establish-\\nments satisfactorily performed activities needed to pass their audits, they \\nreceived superior grades.\\nAudit standards vary. Robert Brackett, former senior vice president of the \\nGrocery Manufacturers Association, asserted that some inspections can be \\nrigorous, particularly if they use internationally recognized private bench-\\nmarks (Sun, 2010). However, those audits are expensive and therefore not \\ncommonly done in the majority of U.S. meat and poultry plants.\\nThe effectiveness in improving food safety after an audit depends on \\nthe seriousness with which a plant takes the auditor\\u2019s recommendations. \\nPlant managers likely will implement an auditor\\u2019s recommendations if not \\nfollowing the recommendations poses a risk to their business, such as losing \\na potential contract. However, if a customer does not evaluate audit outcomes \\ncarefully and does not require a plant to make changes, then recommenda-\\ntions may or may not be followed. The Peanut Corporation of America \\napparently did not implement several important recommendations made by 4\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nauditors because the peanut processing plant\\u2019s customers failed to follow up \\non those recommendations by their own auditors (Moss and Martin, 2009).\\nAuditor Services and the Incentives To Use Them\\nLarge fast food restaurants, grocery store chains, and other large customers \\nof meat and poultry plants have recognized that they face considerable \\nmarket risks if they serve contaminated meat and poultry products. These \\nthreats have led some large customers to demand strong food safety measures \\nfrom their meat and poultry suppliers. A meat or poultry plant, on the other \\nhand, wants to reduce its costs as much as possible, so it has an incentive \\nto conduct only the minimum level of sanitation and process control. Since \\nthese two interests are at odds, the plant and its large customer may enter \\ninto a long-term contract in which the plant agrees to perform specified food \\nsafety tasks in exchange for an exclusive production agreement or a price \\npremium for its products. (Ollinger and Mueller, 2003; Golan et al., 2004). \\nA long-term contract does not completely resolve the conflict because the \\nactivities of plants are not observed by their customers. Customers cannot \\ndistinguish between contaminated meat and poultry and wholesome meat \\nor poultry when there is no outward sign of contamination such as an \\u201coff\\u201d \\nsmell or discoloration. As a result, major customers must either risk receiving \\ncontaminated meat or evaluate the food safety performance of their suppliers. \\nIf they choose to evaluate food safety performance, large customers can use \\ntheir own inhouse experts or hire meat and poultry food safety auditors. The \\nfrequency of the evaluations depends on the interests of the large customer.\\nAuditor services may be used in other situations as well. For example, a plant \\nmanager may use an auditor to assess the food safety integrity of the plant\\u2019s \\noperations. Below, we discuss four types of auditing arrangements.\\nTypes of Audits and Their Incentives\\nThere are four types of auditing arrangements that a plant may have:2\\n1. First, a plant may be subject to no audits. These plants likely serve \\ncustomers who do not demand audits and have managers who see \\nno need for audits. A manager may not use auditor services because \\naudits are costly and (1) a plant may be small enough that the manager \\ncan closely monitor operations or (2) the plant may never have had an \\nadverse food safety event and the manager may see no need to change, or \\n(3) the manager may not view food safety as a top priority. \\n2. The second auditing arrangement is when plants are subject to audits by \\ncustomers. These customers want to be sure that the meat or poultry they \\nbuy is safe and that their meat or poultry suppliers are meeting the food \\nsafety standards that they agreed to as part of a purchase contract. In this \\ncase, the auditor acts as an agent of the meat or poultry customer. Since \\nthe customer hires and pays the auditor, the incentives between the meat \\nor poultry customer and auditor are aligned and the auditor has a strong \\nincentive to report any deviations by a plant that are below the standards \\nof the customer.\\n2One might consider a different type \\nof audit in which auditors hired by \\na plant evaluate the performance of \\ncleaning crews hired as contractors by \\nthat plant. Presumably, respondents \\nto the survey would indicate whether \\nthe auditor was hired by the customer \\nor the plant and report accordingly. It \\nshould also be noted that USDA-FSIS \\nand USDA\\u2019s Agricultural Marketing \\nService (AMS) periodically conduct \\naudits as part of their regulatory \\nauthority. Since these are not initiated \\nby the private sector, they are neither \\nreported nor discussed here.5 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\n3. A third type of audit relationship is when a large meat or poultry \\ncustomer wants an audit but leaves it up to the plant to select the auditor. \\nHere plant management is an agent of the customer and the auditor is an \\nagent of the plant management. This type of relationship is complicated \\nbecause plant management hires the auditor. The plant could hire an \\nexperienced auditor that gives a fair assessment or it could hire a low-\\nskilled or less experienced auditor who is less able to identify deviations \\nfrom expected performance and is more likely to give a good report. \\nRegardless of which type of auditor is hired, an auditor should report \\nall observed deviations from generally accepted food safety practices. \\nHowever, this could create a conflict for the auditor because a negative \\nreport would look bad for the plant that hired the auditor and could cause \\nthe plant to deny the auditor any future business. Thus, the decision for \\nthe auditor is to weigh any benefits that may be achieved from giving \\na report that is more favorable to the plant against the costs of losing a \\ngood reputation for auditing services.\\n4. A fourth type of auditing arrangement is when plants hire their own audi-\\ntors. The plant could use the audit results to verify the effectiveness of \\ncomponents of its manufacturing process or its entire processing system. \\nIn this case, a plant would ask an auditor to review all or some of its food \\nsafety activities and could adjust all, some, or none of the processes that \\nan auditor cites as being deficient. Thus, a plant could have an audit and \\nthe audit could indicate that food safety activities that the auditor exam-\\nined met specified standards. Yet, a plant could have poor food safety \\nperformance because activities not evaluated by the auditor caused a \\nsystem failure.\\nPlant managers have the option to comply with audit findings and do so only \\nif it is profitable. Given similar findings, managers would be more likely to \\ncomply with audits as the costs of compliance drop, the value of the custom-\\ner\\u2019s purchase order rises, and the threat of a detectable food safety failure \\nrises.3 For example, a plant would likely comply with the auditor\\u2019s findings if \\nthe customer has a large order and the cost of complying with the audit report \\nis low. It would also likely comply if an audit reveals a serious food safety \\nbreach that could undermine the viability of a plant\\u2019s business. However, \\nif a customer has a small order and the costs of complying with the audit \\nare high, then a plant manager might not strictly comply with the auditor\\u2019s \\nfindings. \\nAudit Compliance and Audit Certification\\nCustomers and plants recognize the incentives existing in auditor-client rela-\\ntionships. Yet, no government or third party guarantees that a plant adhered \\nto the recommendations put forward by the auditor. Rather, it is up to the \\nbuyer to verify that auditor recommendations were followed. For buyers \\npurchasing large quantities of few inputs from a limited number of plants, \\nusing auditor services and verifying their effectiveness may be relatively low \\ncost. But, some buyers may purchase thousands of inputs or buy a few inputs \\nfrom a large number of plants, making it very costly to verify that auditor \\nrecommendations were followed.\\nThere is also no government or third-party agent that attests to the quality \\nof the auditor. Thus, certifications have become a particularly important \\n3Compliance costs are afffected by the \\nstrictness with which a customer may \\nhold plants to the audit findings. If \\nplants must strictly adhere to findings, \\nthen costs rise. If plants do not have to \\nstrictly meet audit requirements, then \\ncosts drop.6\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\ndevice for attesting to auditor skill. But, there are many certifications avail-\\nable, and their quality may depend on the quality and reputation of the certi-\\nfiers (Sun, 2010). Certifiers that are well-recognized professionals in their \\nfield or organizations, such as the Professional Animal Auditor Certification \\nOrganization, Inc., may offer greater assurance of auditor quality than less \\nwell-known certifiers. \\nLarge auditing firms and those with years of experience also can provide \\nsome reassurance about auditor quality because their reputations can be \\nevaluated. According to Kyle Yudis, an executive with Silliker, Inc., a large \\ninternational audit company, there are only about six large, international food \\nauditing companies and hundreds of small food auditing companies (Yudis, \\n2010). The larger companies may serve a range of customer needs, while \\nthe smaller companies tend to specialize in just one industry or one type of \\naudit.4 The larger auditing companies may employ their own auditors or use \\ncontractors.\\nNumber of Audits and the Incentives for Food Safety\\nIt may be difficult to distinguish the food safety performance of plants \\naudited by customer-hired auditors from the performance of plants audited \\nby plant-hired auditors. Both have a single-type of audit arrangement, and, \\nunder these single-audit arrangements, there is one party to the exchange \\nthat may not put a strong emphasis on food safety. Plants subject to audits \\nby customer-hired auditors but not by their own plant-hired auditor have \\ncustomers who place some value on food safety. If the plant chooses not \\nto have its own auditors, that suggests it sees no need for additional audit \\nrecommendations and verifications. Plants using only a plant-hired auditor \\nappear to be concerned about food safety or they wouldn\\u2019t have hired audi-\\ntors. But their customers do not demand these audits and, thus, would not \\nlikely encourage a plant to select a high-quality auditor and follow all audit \\nrecommendations.\\nDouble-audit plants (customer- and plant-hired auditors) likely have the \\nstrongest incentives to maintain food safety. These plants could have \\nparticularly cautious managers who hire auditors to inspect their operations \\nin order to ensure that their plants comply with their customers\\u2019 standards. \\nOr, double-audit plants could have buyers who require them to be audited \\nby particular auditors. Managers of double-audit plants may hire auditors \\nto evaluate aspects of their operations not adequately addressed by their \\ncustomers\\u2019 audits. Or, an audit may be used to determine whether a plant\\u2019s \\nprocedures meet acceptable standards. Regardless of the explanation, it \\nappears that double-audit plants may place a stronger emphasis on food \\nsafety than single-audit plants because both parties (customer and plant) \\ninvest in auditor services.\\n4According to Stier (2009), there are \\nmany types of food safety audits. These \\naudits may cover all or only part of a \\nplant\\u2019s entire food safety quality con-\\ntrol system. Some common food safety \\naudits are: Food Safety and Good \\nManagement Practices (GMPs) for \\nFood Processing Facilities; Food Safety \\nand GMPs for Distribution Centers; \\nHACCP Verification Audit (benchmark-\\ning and confirming a program); Animal \\nWelfare Audit; Good Laboratory Prac-\\ntices Audit; Quality Systems Audit; and \\nSafe Quality Food (SQF) Audit. All of \\nthese programs as well as auditors have \\nto have special types of certifications, \\ndepending on the type of food audited \\nand the type of audit performed.7 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nEconomic Framework\\nPlants pay for auditor services, perform cleaning and sanitation tasks, monitor \\nplant operations, conduct product testing, and make capital investments in \\nfood safety equipment in order to enhance food safety. These investments have \\ncost the meat and poultry industry millions of dollars (Ollinger, Moore, and \\nChandran, 2004). Yet, there is no evidence that consumers are willing to pay \\na higher price for food safety (i.e., for guarantees that meat or poultry has less \\nrisk of harmful pathogens). Li and Hooker (2009) found that firms have rarely \\nadvertised that a product was free of pathogens and that there was no signifi-\\ncant difference in price for firms that did advertise. Below, we examine why it \\nmay still be profitable for firms to invest in food safety. \\nWhy Plants Make Food Safety Investments and  \\nUse Auditor Services\\nThere are several factors motivating food safety investment. First, fear of \\nlost profitability and revenues due to product recalls may encourage firms to \\nuse food safety technologies. Thomsen and McKenzie (2001) found that that \\nfirms that recalled contaminated meat or poultry products suffered a decline \\nin long-run profitability. Piggott and Marsh (2004) and Marsh, Schroeder, \\nand Mintert (2004) determined that adverse food safety events led to tempo-\\nrary declines in meat and poultry consumption. Thomsen, Shiptsova, and \\nHamm (2006) established that sales of branded frankfurter products declined \\nmore than 20 percent after a product recall. Finally, McKenzie and Thomsen \\n(2001) found that recalls for E. coli O157:H7 resulted in a decline in prices \\nfor boneless beef. \\nPlants may also invest in food safety technology and audit services to support \\nan important brand. Shapiro (1983) showed that plants selling branded \\nproducts must support their brands with investments because their products \\nare readily identified by consumers and they want to convey an image of \\nhigh quality. Food safety investment is necessary to avoid brand destruction \\nthrough a product recall. Sara Lee, for example, suffered a large recall of \\nbranded hot dogs and was able to regain profitability in its branded hot dog \\nbusiness only after more than $70 million of investment in food safety and \\nmarketing (Auerswald, 1999).\\nPlants selling generic products, in contrast to those selling branded products, \\nsell products to buyers that resell or reprocess that product with identical \\nproducts from other suppliers, such that the producer of any single product \\ncannot be identified. Thus, the plant producing generic products may invest \\nless in food safety technology than plants selling branded products. All plants \\nmust invest in food safety technology up to a point that will enable them to \\nmeet USDA/FSIS or State regulatory standards.5 \\nOther factors encouraging food safety technology use by meat and poultry \\nslaughter and processing plants are purchase specifications and the fear \\nof lost business from fast food restaurants and other large customers. \\nCompliance with purchase specifications often requires the use of an array \\nof food safety technologies (Golan et al., 2004). Meat and poultry plants \\nwith contracts with large customers are always under a threat of a contract \\n5All meat or poultry plants must be \\ninspected by either the Federal or \\nState Government. Under the Code \\nof Federal Regulations (9 CFR Parts \\n321, 332, and 381 [Docket No. FSIS-\\n2008-0039] RIN 0583-AD37), select \\nState-inspected establishments have \\nthe option to ship meat and poultry \\nproducts, bearing an official USDA \\nmark of inspection, across State lines if \\nthey comply with all Federal standards \\nunder the Federal Meat Inspection \\nAct (FMIA) and the Poultry Products \\nInspection Act (PPIA). These establish-\\nments will receive inspection services \\nfrom State inspection personnel that \\nhave been trained in FMIA and PPIA \\nrequirements. State-inspected plants \\nnot among this select group of plants \\nare permitted to ship only within their \\nStates. All State inspection agencies \\nmust meet the same safety standards as \\nthese of federally inspected plants.8\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\ncancellation if a serious product recall occurs. Hudson Meat left the ground-\\nmeat business after Burger King, a major customer, cancelled its contract \\nfollowing a major recall of Hudson products (Winter, 2002). Likewise, \\nTopps Meat and Westland-Hallmark Meat companies also exited the beef \\nindustry after their products were subjected to recalls. \\nPlant Size and Firm Type, Food Safety Investment, and \\nthe Use of Auditors\\nThe threat of business losses due to product recalls, the need to support \\nbranded products, and compliance with customer specifications encourage \\nplants to make food safety investments and use auditor services. However, \\nplants must still reach maximum profitability. Thus, they minimize their \\ncosts under the constraints of making the food safety investments and using \\nthe auditor services that their markets demand.\\nFood Safety Technology and Auditor Use and Plant Size\\nCost minimizing behavior, different types of plant production technolo-\\ngies, and the food safety investments that plants must make to meet market \\ndemands suggests that plant-level food safety technology use may vary \\nacross plants. One determining factor in food safety technology use is the \\ncompatibility of a plant with different food safety technologies. Large plants \\nusing high-speed production lines must use high-speed food safety tech-\\nniques to ensure that production lines operate continuously and produce meat \\nand poultry that is free of harmful pathogens. Small cattle slaughter plants \\nthat butcher only a few animals per day may obtain the same level of food \\nsafety by closely monitoring operations and thoroughly cleaning plant facili-\\nties. Thus, small and large plants likely make different types and amounts of \\nfood safety investments.\\nTechnological compatibility is important, but there are other reasons why \\nlarger plants may have a greater incentive to make food safety investments \\nand use auditor services than smaller plants. First, large plants may have \\nmuch greater cash flow and access to credit than small plants, and this greater \\naccess may enable them to purchase equipment more easily. Second, large \\nplants have much more to lose in the event of a serious food safety failure. \\nFor example, assume that a plant can be sold for the value of its fixed invest-\\nments, contracts, and goodwill and 50 percent of the value of firm is due \\nto fixed investment and 50 percent is due to contracts and goodwill. Now \\nsuppose that there are two plants\\u2014one valued at $1 million and one valued \\nat $1 billion\\u2014and that each loses its reputation for food safety. If the loss of \\na reputation for food safety causes all goodwill to vanish, then the smaller \\nplant loses $500,000 and the larger plant loses $500 million. Thus, a large \\nplant would be willing to invest more in food safety technology and auditor \\nservices than would a smaller plant. \\nThird, large plants may also have lower costs of using auditor services and \\nsome food safety technologies. Auditor services and carcass pasteurizing \\nand other modern food safety equipment are expensive fixed costs, but large \\nplants can spread theses fixed costs over more units of output than a small \\nplant can, resulting in a lower cost per pound of output. For example, assume \\na large cattle slaughter plant processes 1 million pounds of meat per day 9 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nwhile a small plant processes 1 million pounds in a year, and that each plant \\nchooses to pasteurize cattle carcasses with a steam pasteurizer costing $1 \\nmillion in capital expenditures. If each plant must pay for equipment within \\n1 year, then the cost per pound for the large plant is less than one-half cent \\nper pound while that for the small plant is about $1 per pound.6 In addition, \\nspecialization of labor may enable large plants to gain more expertise about \\nfood safety technologies. This expertise may make them more prone to use \\nfood safety technologies than would a smaller plant.\\nGreater use of some food safety technologies and auditor services at large \\nplants than at small plants does not mean that output from large plants there-\\nfore is safer. Small plants have an incentive to provide robust food safety if \\nthe markets they serve require it. Some small plants serve niche markets that \\nlink plants with products. By contrast, large plants with no pressure from \\ncustomers and selling generic products on the spot market may feel little \\nneed to invest in food safety because their products may not be easily identi-\\nfied, especially once they have been reprocessed or labeled further down the \\nsupply chain.\\nSmall plants realize their own advantages in maintaining food safety. Most \\nimportantly, they have more operational flexibility than do large plants. If a \\nsmall plant has food safety problems, managers can slow production lines \\nand address those problems with little lost production time. Moreover, sanita-\\ntion and operations\\u2014two fundamental food safety technologies that all plants \\nmust maintain\\u2014tend to be scale-neutral (i.e., a plant with twice as much \\noutput as another plant may have to devote twice as much effort to sanitation \\nand operations). Thus, smaller plants emphasizing sanitation in all their oper-\\nations and maintaining constant vigilance over food safety process control \\nmay reach the same level of food safety as a large plant using complex food \\nsafety equipment. \\nA small plant may have less need for an auditor. Small plants are often \\nmanaged directly by owners, who have a strong incentive to maintain food \\nsafety in order to avoid a loss of business as well as a blow to their personal \\nreputations. Moreover, these plants have less complex operations, making \\nthem easier to monitor. \\nSingle- and Multi-Plant Firms and Food Safety Investment\\nFirms that own more than one plant (multiplant firms) may be more likely to \\nhave audits and make food safety investments than single-plant firms. First, \\nthe expected losses at a multiplant firm may be higher than at a single-plant \\nfirm. Suppose, similar to a previous hypothetical example, 50 percent of the \\nvalue of firm is due to fixed investment and 50 percent is due to contracts \\nand goodwill. Now suppose that there are three plants producing the same \\nproduct and each plant is valued at $100 million and that one firm owns two \\nplants and the other firm owns one plant. If both firms lose their reputations \\nfor food safety, then the single-plant firm loses $50 million and the two-plant \\nfirm loses $100 million. Thus, multiplant firms would be willing to invest \\nmore in auditor services and food safety technology than single-plant firms.\\nFirms that own more than one plant may have lower costs of implementing \\nfood safety technologies. Firms experience a learning curve when adopting \\n6 This is a simple hypothetical example, \\nnot intended to be factually correct. Ac-\\ntual costs to these two types of plants \\nwould be very different than those ex-\\npressed here. However, the example is \\nvalid since there still would be a large \\ndifference in costs.10\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nmore advanced technology, enabling multiplant firms to install and imple-\\nment new technologies in other plants at a lower cost after they have already \\nused it in one plant. This may be why Dunne (1994) found that multiplant \\nfirms were more likely to invest in manufacturing technologies than single-\\nplant firms. \\nSummary\\nDue to their size, large plants find it necessary to invest more in high-speed \\nfood safety technologies to provide the food safety they need to meet their \\ncustomers\\u2019 demands. They also may suffer a greater financial loss than \\nsmall plants if they have a food safety failure, have lower per-unit cost of \\nfood safety fixed-cost investments, and may have lower financing costs. \\nThus, it is no surprise that Dunne (1994) found that larger plants were more \\nlikely to adopt new manufacturing technologies and Ollinger, Moore, and \\nChandran (2004) and Muth (2002) found that large meat and poultry plants \\nmake greater use of food safety technology than small plants do. For similar \\nreasons, firms that own more than one plant may make greater use of food \\nsafety technology and auditor services than single-plant firms.\\nOur discussion of audit arrangements and food safety performance suggests \\nthat single-audit plants (customer- or plant-hired auditors) may emphasize food \\nsafety less than double-audit type plants (customer- and plant-hired auditors). \\nSimilarly, a single-audit plant may emphasize food safety more than a no-audit \\nplant of a similar size. Economic theory suggests that if a plant values food \\nsafety higher, then it will invest more in food safety, suggesting an association \\nbetween auditor use and food safety technology use.7 Thus, we expect food \\nsafety technology levels to be higher for double-audit plants than for single-\\naudit plants and for audit plants than for no-audit plants.\\n7Ollinger and Moore (2009) showed \\nthat food safety technology negatively \\naffects Salmonella levels in meat and \\npoultry products, suggesting that \\nprocessors who place a higher value on \\nfood safety invest more in food safety \\ntechnology.11 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nSurvey Techniques and the Data\\nPlant data on self-reported food safety technologies and practices were \\nobtained from a national survey of Federal and State-inspected meat \\nslaughter, poultry slaughter, and processing-only plants. The survey was \\nsponsored by FSIS and conducted by RTI International in 2004 for meat and \\npoultry slaughter plants and in 2005 for processing-only plants. The analysis \\ndescribed in this report focuses on federally inspected plants.8\\nA detailed description of the multimodal survey approach used for adminis-\\ntering the surveys is given in Cates et al. (2005, 2006). The survey instrument \\nand study design were approved under the U.S. Office of Management and \\nBudget\\u2019s information collection clearance process. A brief overview of the \\nsampling methods, questionnaire development, survey administration, and \\nanalysis procedures is given in appendix A. \\nThe analyses compare large and small plants. We defined large plants as \\nthose plants falling in the top quintile of volume of production (80-99 percen-\\ntile) and the small plants as those falling in the bottom quintile (0-19 percen-\\ntile). The distributions of plants by quintile and total numbers of plants for \\neach of the six analysis categories are provided in table 1. \\nVariable Measurement\\nThere are four types of variables used in the analysis: an indicator for each of \\nthe four types of audits, whether the plant was owned by a single- or multi-\\nplant firm, plant size, and food safety technology. Our measures of plant \\naudit type were taken directly from the survey and include one no-audit, \\ntwo single-audit, and one double-audit types. Single-audit plants have either \\naudits sponsored by customers or audits sponsored by the plant or the parent \\n(owner) of the plant. Double-audit plants have audits by both customers and \\nthe plant.\\n8Virtually all State-inspected plants are \\nin the very small size category, with \\nnine or fewer employees.\\nTable 1   \\nPlants in each size quintile by type\\nSize percentiles (ranked by pounds of output) Total \\nnumber  Plant type 0\\u201319 20\\u201339 40\\u201359 60\\u201379 80\\u201399\\n------------------------Number of plants------------------------\\nSlaughter1\\n Cattle slaughter 52 53 53 53 53 264\\n Hog slaughter 51 52 51 52 51 257\\n Poultry slaughter 40 41 41 41 41 204\\nProcessing only \\n RTE products 32 33 32 33 32 162\\n NRTE products 42 42 44 42 41 211\\n Ground beef 15 16 17 13 18 79\\n1Slaughter industries includes plants that only slaughter animals (i.e., slaughter-only plants) and \\nplants that both slaughter animals and process raw meat.\\nRTE=Ready To Eat.\\nNRTE=Not Ready To Eat.\\nSource: USDA, Economic Research Service and RTI calculations.12\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nThe measure of whether the plant was owned by a single- or multiplant \\nfirm was taken from a survey question asking whether a plant has a parent \\ncompany that owns other plants. Plant size is based on pounds of produc-\\ntion per year and was calculated by summing responses to the volume ques-\\ntions in the surveys.9 There were 74 meat slaughter and 16 poultry slaughter \\nplants that did not give production volumes. For these plants, we calculated \\nestimated values based on 2004 slaughter volumes obtained from FSIS\\u2019s \\nAnimal Disposition Reporting System. Since output is reported in animals \\nslaughtered in this dataset, we converted animals slaughtered to their weight \\nequivalent. We did this by multiplying the number of animals slaughtered \\ntimes the average dressed weight of that animal. Output volumes for poultry \\nspecies were defined as the number of birds slaughtered times the average \\nlive weight times the average dressing percentage. Average dressed (carcass) \\nweights, live weights, and dressing percentages for meat species in 2004 \\nwere obtained from USDA/ERS Red Meat Yearbook; average live weights \\nfor poultry species in 2004 were obtained from USDA/National Agricultural \\nStatistical Service Poultry Yearbook; and, average dressing percentages for \\npoultry were obtained from USDA/Agricultural Marketing Service Market \\nNews for the week ending November 1, 2008. Dressing percentages for 2008 \\nwere used because estimates were not available for 2004.10 Note that for \\ntwo meat slaughter plants, slaughter volumes for 2004 were not available, so \\nwe used their 2003 volumes. Furthermore, for five poultry slaughter plants, \\nslaughter volumes for 2004 were not available, so we used 2003 volumes \\n(four plants) or 2002 volumes (one plant).\\nConstruction of a Food Safety Technology Index\\nWe constructed a food safety technology index based on a methodology \\ndiscussed in an earlier ERS report (Ollinger, Moore, and Chandran, 2004). \\nThis technology index is grounded on the idea that food safety process \\ncontrol is a system in which plants marshal several different types of equip-\\nment and practices to maintain process control\\u2014 produce meat or poultry \\nthat is free of harmful contaminants.\\nIt is more precise to compare similar technologies and production practices \\nacross plants (e.g., equipment of one plant to equipment of another) rather \\nthan an overall system of food safety that includes a mixture of technolo-\\ngies and practices. Thus, we created five food safety technology indexes that \\ncorrespond with questions in the survey. These five technologies are:\\n\\u2022\\tDehiding/slaughter (cattle and hog slaughter only)\\u2014method of removing \\nthe hide from (dehiding) carcasses, sanitizing practices and frequencies \\nin the slaughter areas, and whether a plant requires its animal suppliers to \\nmeet pathogen-control standards.\\n\\u2022\\tSanitation\\u2014sanitizing practices and frequencies in the further processing \\nareas and removal of biomatter.11\\n\\u2022\\tOperations\\u2014use of written policies and procedures for recalls, tracking \\nproducts backward and forward, whether a plant requires its meat \\nsuppliers to meet pathogen-control standards, employee food safety \\ntraining, use of dedicated manager and staff for food safety activities, etc.\\n9For meat slaughter, the volume ques-\\ntions were 1.5 and 2.12. For poultry \\nslaughter, the volume questions were \\n1.5 and 2.11; see: http://www.fsis.usda.\\ngov/PDF/SRM_Survey_Slaughter_&_\\nProcessing_Plants.pdf/. For processing-\\nonly plants, the volume questions were \\n1.12 through 1.15; see: http://www.fsis.\\nusda.gov/PDF/SRM_Survey_Meat_&_\\nPoultry_Processing_Only_Plants.pdf /.\\n10The meat species and carcass weight \\nare: steers\\u2013806 pounds, heifers\\u2013740 \\npounds, cows\\u2013614 pounds, bulls\\u2013893 \\npounds, veal calves\\u2013201 pounds, bar-\\nrows and gilts\\u2013196 pounds, sows\\u2013313 \\npounds, boars\\u2013220 pounds, sheep\\u201366 \\npounds, lambs\\u201369 pounds, goats\\u201325 \\npounds, and other meat species\\u2013684 \\npounds (assumed bison).

It \\nincludes cutting, deboning, trimming, \\ngrinding, cooking, and other process-\\ning areas. This step precedes packaging \\nproducts for the consumer.13 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\n\\u2022\\tEquipment\\u2014use of food safety equipment and other technologies in \\nthe slaughter area (e.g., steam vacuum units or organic acid rinses) \\nand processing area (e.g., high pressure processing or application of \\nantimicrobials). \\n\\u2022\\tTesting\\u2014pathogen testing practices, organisms tested, and testing \\nfrequencies.\\nThree principles were followed in creating the food safety technology index. \\nFirst, the rating system should be monotonic because more intensive opera-\\ntions should yield greater food safety protection than less intensive ones. For \\nexample, plants with more intensive cleaning or that use a specific piece of \\nfood safety equipment should have higher scores than plants with less inten-\\nsive cleaning or without the same piece of equipment. Second, comparisons \\nshould be made for technology types (see earlier discussion). Third, since \\nfood safety quality control requires a systematic approach, a variety of tech-\\nnology components within each technology type should be considered. For \\nexample, steam vacuum units, carcass pasteurizers, and various sanitizing \\nsprays are important technologies, included in the overall and equipment \\nindexes, and considered by meat experts as components of an effective \\nprocess control system.\\nConstruction of the index followed several general procedures that are \\ndescribed in appendix B and lead to an index that ranges from 0 to 1. That \\ndiscussion can be summarized as follows. If plants do not use a type of food \\nsafety equipment or procedure, they were assigned 0 points for that tech-\\nnology, and, if the procedure or equipment is used, then they were assigned \\n1 point. If plants used an intermediate level of a procedure or task, then point \\nvalues falling between 0 and 1 were assigned. For example, if the options \\nfor cleaning were once per week, once per day, once per shift, or once per \\nhour and the plant chose once per shift, then it would be assigned a number \\nbetween 0 and 1e. After assigning values, all assigned values were added \\ntogether and the resulting sum was divided by the total number of questions \\nused to create that particular index (e.g., sanitation). Appendix table B1 gives \\nthe survey questions supporting each technology index for each technology \\ntype for the cattle, hog, and poultry slaughter and processing industries and \\nall processing-only plants. 14\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nData Discussion \\nTables 2, 3, and 4 present pounds of output by plant size and type of industry \\nand type of outside auditor.12 Table 2 shows that the largest plants are very \\nmuch larger than the smallest plants when measured in terms of pounds of \\noutput. Cattle and hog slaughter plants in the top quintile produced more \\nthan 10,000 times more pounds of output than competitors in the bottom \\nquintile. Plants in the top quintile in other industries were between 100 and \\n1,000 times larger in terms of pounds of output than their competitors in the \\nbottom quintile. Notice also that slaughter plants in the top quintile were \\n15-45 times larger in terms of output than the largest processing-only plants, \\nbut cattle and hog plants in bottom quintiles were about the same size as the \\nprocessing-only plants. Finally, poultry plants in all quintiles are larger than \\ntheir counterparts in other industries.\\nTables 3 and 4 show auditing practices by quintile. More than 80 percent \\nof plants in the top quintile of each industry were subject to audits of any \\ntype, while from 55 to 90 percent of plants in the bottom quintile of each \\nindustry had no audits. The majority of plants in the top quintile of all but the \\nnot-ready-to-eat (NRTE) industry were double-audit plants (i.e., used both \\ncustomer-hired and plant-hired auditors). Most plants in the bottom quintile \\nof each industry had no audits, and a majority of plants in the bottom three \\nquintiles in all industries except poultry slaughter were no-audit plants.\\nAppendix table B1 shows that cattle and hog slaughter plants in the top quin-\\ntiles were mainly single-species plants (i.e., either cattle-only or hog-only); \\n12Appendix tables B2-B4 show the \\nnumber of animals slaughtered by in-\\ndustry and plant size and output shares \\nby industry and size.\\nTable 2   \\nSlaughter and processing industries: Output per plant per industry quintile1\\nPlant size quintile (ranked by pounds of output)\\nPlant type 0\\u201319 20\\u201339 40\\u201359 60\\u201379 80\\u201399\\n----------------------------Mean pounds per plant----------------------------\\nSlaughter1\\n Cattle slaughter 28, 042 157,808 508,319 3,328,599 317,592,240\\n Hog slaughter 23,999 137,691 445,834  2,717, 570 293,875,382\\n Poultry slaughter 4,405,970 66,701,669 151,698,487 228,093,237 450,675,247\\nProcessing only \\n RTE products 13,125 132,273 651,563  7,966,818 22,262,813\\n NRTE products 22,024 126,310 550,114  3,680,952 13,292,927\\n Ground beef 30,667 196,875 752,059  5,038,462 11,358,056\\nNotes: Mean pounds for slaughter were calculated by multiplying number of head slaughtered by average carcass \\nweight pounds (lbs) per head as reported in USDA\\u2019s Red Meat Yearbook and Poultry Yearbook for 2004.

Primal cuts accounted for more than 80 percent \\nof the output of cattle and hog slaughter plants in the top quintile. In contrast, \\nthree-fourths of the output of plants in the bottom quintile consisted of raw \\nground meat and processed products. Plants in the top and bottom quintiles \\nof the other industries had similar output mixes. Poultry plants in all quin-\\ntiles produced mainly raw, not ground products; half the output of plants of \\nall quintiles in the ready-to-eat (RTE) industry was fully cooked, not shelf \\nstable products; plants of all quintiles in the NRTE industry produced a mix \\nof output; plants of all quintiles in the ground beef industry produced mainly \\nraw ground meat.\\nResults \\nWe examine differences in statistical means of the technology index across \\nfive size categories of plants, two firm types (whether the plant is a part of \\na single-plant or multiplant firm), four audit types, and five plant sizes and \\ntwo audit types. We do pair-wise means tests for comparisons of two groups \\n(e.g., single-plant versus multiplant firms). However, a different statistical \\ntest is required when there are more than two groups (e.g., comparisons of \\ntechnology use across the five groups (quintiles) in table 5). It can be shown \\nthat a positive (significant) outcome is more likely if there are more compari-\\nsons. A Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test is used in this study to \\nadjust for the tendency to have false positives in series of pair-wise statistical \\ntests. This multiple comparison test requires a stronger level of evidence for \\nan individual comparison to be deemed \\u201csignificant\\u201d than would a series of \\npair-wise means tests. Although there are other multiple comparison tests, \\nthe Tukey-Kramer method is most appropriate for our case because the data \\nare unbalanced (SAS manual, p. 2,514, 2009).13 \\nFood Safety Technology Indexes and Plant Characteristics\\nPlant size \\nTable 5 shows that the food safety technology indexes increase with size \\nand that there are sharp differences between plants in the top and bottom \\npercentiles in the cattle and hog slaughter industries. In both industries, the \\ntechnology index values were about one-third larger for plants in the top \\nquintile relative to those in the bottom quintile. Based on the Tukey multiple \\ncomparison test, the index values for plants in the top cattle slaughter quintile \\nwere significantly larger than the index values for plants in the other four \\nquintiles for all but the sanitation index (p<0.01). For sanitation, the index \\nvalue for plants in the top quintile was significantly larger (p<0.05) compared \\nto only plants in the bottom two quintiles. For hog slaughter, index values \\nfor plants in the top quintile were significantly larger for all but sanitation \\nand dehiding. None of the dehiding index comparisons were significantly \\ndifferent.14 For sanitation, the technology index for plants in the top quintile \\nwas significantly larger (p<0.05) when compared to only plants in the bottom \\ntwo quintiles.\\n13See http://support.sas.com/documen-\\ntation/cdl/en/statug/63033/html/default/\\nviewer.htm#statug_glm_a0000000862.\\nhtm/ for more discussion.\\n14Hog slaughter operations do not \\ntypically dehide hogs.

By contrast, nearly 90 percent of NRTE plants in \\nthe top quintile had audits.26\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nConcluding Discussion\\nProviding an economic framework and then testing several implications of \\nthat framework with simple means tests, Tukey multiple comparison tests, \\nand other univariate methods allowed us to examine the incentives of meat \\nand poultry plant managers to use food safety auditors and food safety \\ntechnologies. \\nWe find that meat and poultry plants that are subject to audits have higher \\nfood safety technology indexes than plants not subject to audits. We also \\nfind (1) that double-audit plants (at least one auditor hired by customer and \\none hired by plant) had higher index values than both no- and single-audit \\nplants for all technologies except sanitation and operations, (2) single-audit \\nplants (at least one auditor hired by either customer or plant) generally had \\nhigher index values than no-audit plants for all technologies except sanita-\\ntion and operations, and (3) large plants and plants owned by multiplant firms \\nhave higher food safety technology indexes than their small and single-plant \\ncompetitors.\\nThis work both updates and extends earlier work by Ollinger, Moore, and \\nChandran (2004) by showing that plant size is correlated with a food safety \\ntechnology index at a different point in time (2004 versus 2001) and by \\nshowing that the technology indexes are correlated with food safety audits. \\nIt is interesting to observe that the sanitation index is higher only for audited \\nversus unaudited plants in the cattle and hog slaughter industries and not \\nother industries. We attribute this outcome to FSIS\\u2019s regulatory focus. FSIS \\nstresses cleaning and sanitation, but mandates very little fixed investment \\nand testing. This regulatory focus on sanitation may reduce the marginal \\nimprovements achievable through even more sanitation but may not affect \\nthe gains from other food safety technologies and practices. Thus, managers \\nmay be making discretionary food safety investments in non-sanitation tech-\\nnologies\\u2014operations, equipment, testing, and dehiding\\u2014since those technol-\\nogies (1) may provide greater marginal improvement in food safety process \\ncontrol and (2) may offer a wider range of practices and technologies that can \\nbe used.\\nIt is very important to remember that, since univariate methods were used \\nin the analysis, we did not control for other factors affecting the use of food \\nsafety technologies. Thus, the results provide some, but not complete confi-\\ndence of an association between a technology index and a group of plants \\nclassified by their size, firm type, and audit arrangements.15\\n15 Survey responses were self-reported \\nby the plant, which increases the likeli-\\nhood of receiving biased information, \\nparticularly since the survey was con-\\nducted for FSIS, a regulatory agency. \\nHowever, we believe most of the data \\nare accurate because (a) the question-\\nnaire stated that the responses would be \\nkept confidential, (b) the questionnaire \\nsaid that only aggregated information \\nwould be provided to FSIS, and (c) \\nmost of the questions dealt with the use \\nof technologies and not more sensitive \\ninformation. It was not within the scope \\nof the study to verify the responses \\nthrough onsite visits or other methods.27 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nReferences\\nAuerswald, Beth A. 1999. \\u201cRestocking the Shelves: Recovering from a \\nRecall,\\u201d Food Quality.

The sampling frame was a Food Safety and Inspection \\nService, USDA,  database of Federal and State-inspected plants that \\ncontains plant-level information on production volume, annual revenue, \\nnumber of employees, inspection activities, and contact information from \\nvarious USDA sources. All commercial plants that currently slaughter meat \\nspecies (cattle, swine, lamb, goat, and other meat species) or poultry species \\n(chicken, turkey, and other poultry species) were included in the sampling \\nframe for the slaughter surveys. All commercial plants that do not slaughter \\nbut conduct further processing of meat and poultry were included in the \\nsampling frame for the processing-only survey. Custom-exempt plants were \\nexcluded.16 The sample was stratified by inspection status (Federal versus \\nState) and hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) size (very \\nsmall, small, and large) as follows:\\n\\u2022\\tlarge plants have 500 or more employees, \\n\\u2022\\tsmall plants have 10 or more employees but fewer than 500, and \\n\\u2022\\tvery small plants have fewer than 10 employees or less than $2.5 million \\nin annual sales.\\nThe sample design specified a sample size that was expected to yield preci-\\nsion of +/\\u20135 percent or better for estimates of all proportions. For federally \\ninspected plants, a systematic sample of very small plants and a census of \\nsmall and large plants were included.17\\nQuestionnaire Development. The questionnaire was designed to collect \\ninformation on the use and frequency of sanitation practices, use of specific \\nfood safety technologies and practices, use and types of microbiological \\ntesting, food safety training procedures, response to the bovine spongiform \\nencephalopathy (BSE) interim final rules by beef packing plants, and plant \\ncharacteristics (e.g., age, size, and number of shifts). Plants were asked to \\nprovide information on their activities during the past year. The slaughter \\nsurveys were administered in 2004, and the processing-only survey was \\nadministered in 2005. Before administering the survey, the questionnaires \\nwere reviewed by trade associations and pretested with a small number of \\nplants.\\nSurvey Administration. A variety of procedures aimed at maximizing the \\nsurvey response rate were used, including many of the procedures recom-\\nmended by Dillman (2000). Before the start of data collection, several \\nindustry trade organizations sent an e-mail message to their membership or \\nposted information in their newsletter and on their website that described the \\nsurvey and encouraged their participation. Sampled plants were contacted \\nby telephone to identify the plant manager and then mailed a letter on \\nFSIS letterhead that described the upcoming survey. Plant managers were \\ncontacted by telephone to screen for eligibility and to identify the target \\nrespondent for the survey (if not the plant manager). The self-administered \\nquestionnaire was delivered via Federal Express followed by a thank you/\\nreminder postcard. Respondents completed the mail questionnaire and \\nsent it back to RTI for keying. Those who did not respond were reminded \\n16Custom-exempt plants can only \\nslaughter and process livestock for the \\nexclusive use of the owner.\\n17Systematic sampling ensures that the \\nselected sample represents the popula-\\ntion by forcing the sample to include \\nplants with varying characteristics, \\nsuch as geographic location and type of \\nspecies.31 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\nthrough a series of telephone calls, and the questionnaire was remailed to \\nnonrespondents. \\nThe numbers of respondents and response rates for each of the surveys are \\nprovided in appendix table A1.\\nFrom each of the survey datasets, we created analysis datasets to focus on \\ncategories of interest as follows:\\n\\u2022\\tFor cattle slaughter plants, the original dataset included 384 federally \\ninspected plants that slaughtered hooved animals. Plants that slaughtered \\nonly veal calves (4 plants), only cows and bulls (12 plants), or only other \\nmeat species were excluded, resulting in a final dataset of 264 plants that \\nslaughtered steers and heifers. Plants that also slaughtered hogs in addition \\nto steers and heifers were retained in the dataset.\\n\\u2022\\tFor hog slaughter plants, the original dataset included 384 federally \\ninspected plants that slaughtered hooved animals. Plants that slaughtered \\nonly sows and boars (19 plants) or only other meat species were excluded, \\nresulting in a final dataset of 257 plants that slaughtered market hogs. \\nPlants that also slaughtered cattle in addition to barrows and gilts were \\nretained in the dataset.\\n\\u2022\\tFor poultry slaughter plants, the original dataset included 218 federally \\ninspected plants that slaughtered young chickens or young turkeys. Of \\nthese, 14 plants that slaughtered only poultry species other than young \\nchickens or young turkeys were deleted, resulting in a final dataset of 204 \\nplants. \\n\\u2022\\tFor processing-only plants that produce processed products, the \\noriginal dataset included 667 federally inspected plants.

First, we grouped similar tech-\\nnologies and practices into one of the five types of food safety practices and \\ntechnologies described above. Second, we valued all questions equally with a \\nmaximum value of 1 and a minimum value of 0. Third, we assigned the most \\nintensive operation within each question a value of 1 and the least intensive \\na value of 0. For example, equipment usage questions and similar questions \\nhad just two possible responses: 1 or 0. Many sanitation and plant operations \\nquestions, however, had multiple choices. For these questions, we assigned \\na 1 to operations that generate the most food safety, a 0 to operations gener-\\nating the least food safety, and an intermediate value between 0 and 1 for \\noperations providing intermediate food safety performance. Intermediate \\nvalues could have been chosen on a linear, logarithmic, or some other mono-\\ntonic scale. We assumed a linear relationship. Thus, if five response choices \\nwere provided, then values would be in fourths (0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and \\n1.0) and, if four response choices were given, then values would be thirds \\n(0.0, 0.33, 0.67, 1.0).\\nFinally, we created a technology index for each technology category by \\nsumming the values of the responses for each of the questions within that \\ncategory\\u2014plant equipment, testing procedures, plant operations, sanitation, \\nand dehiding\\u2014and dividing by the number of questions, yielding an index \\nvalue between 0 and 1. For the overall technology category, we divided the \\ntotal of all technology questions by the total number of food safety tech-\\nnology questions. Examples of the index are given in Ollinger, Moore, and \\nChandran (2004)\\nAlthough we tried to create as precise an index as possible, it is important to \\nrecognize that the index is not exact. First, we chose a linear scale to weigh \\nintermediate survey questions. Second, all pathogen-control activities within \\na category were assumed to be of equal importance. For example, sanitizing \\nknives is of equal importance to washing hands and each of those is equal \\nto the use of a steam vacuum unit. But, it may be that sanitizing knives is \\nmore important than washing hands and the steam vacuum units, in which \\ncase knife sanitation should have a heavier weight. Third, the five tech-\\nnology categories may not be of equal importance. For example, it may be \\nthat sanitation and cleaning is more important than equipment. To partially \\naccommodate this concern, we emphasize the categorical (e.g., index of 34\\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\npathogen-control equipment) rather than the overall pathogen-control plant \\nrating in our discussion. \\nFourth, several procedures employed in order to make a survey response \\nusable may have influenced the final index values:\\n\\u2022\\tA value of 0 for binary responses and the midpoint value for frequency \\nresponses (responses with more than a 0/1 choice, such as a scale) were \\nassigned if the question had a missing response that was not attributed to \\na skipped question. This might have had the tendency to reduce the tech-\\nnology index value for some plants.\\n\\u2022\\tFor questions with multiple responses (e.g., circle all that apply), we used \\nthe response with the highest index value.\\nAppendix table B1   \\nSurvey questions supporting technology indexes for meat and poultry slaughter industries1 \\nType of plant Technology Question number\\nCattle slaughter Dehiding 1.2, 1.6, 1.7, 1.9, 1.9a, 1.9c-e, and 3.2;\\nSanitation 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.13, 2.13c-g, and 5.6\\nOperations 1.9f, 1.9j, 1.9k, 2.13a, 2.13h, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.8, 5.9, and 5.11\\nEquipment 1.8a-k and 2.14a-g\\nTesting 3.1, 3.3, 3.4a-j, 3.5, 3.6a-j, 3.7, 3.8a-k, 3.9, 3.10a-h, 3.11, 3.12a-e, \\n3.13a-e, and 3.14\\nHog slaughter Dehiding 1.2, 1.6, 1.7, 1.9, 1.9a, 1.9c-e, and 3.2;\\nSanitation 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.13, 2.13c-g, and 5.6\\nOperations 1.9f, 1.9j, 1.9k, 2.13a, 2.13h, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.8, 5.9, and 5.11\\nEquipment 1.8a-k and 2.14a-g\\nTesting 3.1, 3.3, 3.4a-j, 3.5, 3.6a-j, 3.7, 3.8a-k, 3.9, 3.10a-h, 3.11, 3.12a-e, \\n3.13a-e, and 3.14\\nChicken slaughter Sanitation 1.2, 1.3, 1.7c-e, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.9c-g, and 5.7\\nOperations 1.7a, 1.7f, 1.7j, 1.7k, 2.9a, 2.9h, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.9, 5.1d, 5.12\\nEquipment 1.6a-g and 2.10a-g\\nTesting 3.1, 3.2, 3.3a-k, 3.4, 3.5a-k, 3.6, 3.7a-i, 3.8, 3.9a-i, 3.10, 3.11a-e, \\n3.12a-e, and 3.13\\nMeat and poultry  \\nprocessing only  \\n(all categories)\\nSanitation 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.16c-g, and 4.6\\nOperations 1.16a, 1.16h, 1.16k, 1.16l, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.10, 4.11, and 4.13\\nEquipment 1.17a-i\\nTesting 1.18, 2.1, 2.2a-k, 2.3, 2.4a-l, 2.5, 2.6a-o, 2.7, 2.8a-k, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11a-c, \\nand 2.12a-c\\n1 Slaughter industries include plants that only slaughter plants (i.e. slaughter-only plants) and plants that both slaughter animals \\nand process raw meat.\\nSlaughter survey questions:  http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/SRM_Survey_Slaughter_&_Processing_Plants.pdf/. \\nProcessing-only plant questions:  http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/SRM_Survey_Meat_&_Poultry_Processing_Only_Plants.pdf/.35 \\nFood Safety Audits, Plant Characteristics, and Food Safety Technology Use in Meat and Poultry Plants / EIB-82\\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\\n\\u2022\\tIf establishments indicated more cleaning shifts than production shifts \\n(suggesting they may have misunderstood the question), we set the \\nnumber of cleaning shifts equal to the number of production shifts.\\n\\u2022\\tFor cattle and hog slaughter plants, nine questions were used to construct \\nthe sanitation index, but eight of these questions were for further \\nprocessing operations and one was for slaughter operations.

It provides management with information on the efficiency with \\nwhich the company controls the quality of its processes and products [1]. \\nThe audit in simple terms could be defined as the inspection of a \\nprocess or a system to ensure that it meets the requirements of its \\nintended use [2]. International organization for standardization \\n(ISO) defines the audits as \\\"Systematic, independent and \\ndocumented process for obtaining audit evidence and evaluating \\nthem objectively to determine the degree to which the verification \\ncriteria are met\\\" [3]. \\nInstead of considering the audit as an intrusive and potentially \\nthreatening review, pharmacies should consider the audit as a \\nquality control mechanism. The results of the audit and the resulting \\ncorrective actions ensure all the involved parties that a program \\nworks in accordance with established rules of practice [4]. \\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, audits are virtual means for \\nassessing compliance with the established objectives defined in the \\nquality system and thus paving the way for the continuous \\nimprovement program by providing feedback to management [2]. A \\ncompany that produces drugs today must be able to demonstrate \\nthat it does so with absolute reliability, in optimal conditions and \\nwith extreme uniformity that allows accurate reproduction [1]. \\nIn food and drug administration (FDA) and ISO environments, \\nauditing of both compliance and performance is essential. \\nPharmaceutical audit experience includes the drafting and revision \\nof validation policies, guidelines and standard operating procedures \\n(SOP) from project qualification to performance evaluation phases \\n[1]. If implemented correctly; it can be one of the most effective \\nmeans of improvement [5]. \\nDefinition of internal audit \\nThe chartered institute of management accountants, UK (CIMA) \\ndefines Internal Audit as:  \\n\\u2018An independent appraisal activity established within an \\norganization as a service to it. It is a control which functions by \\nexamining and evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of other \\ncontrols; a management tool which analyses the effectiveness of all \\nparts of an organization\\u2019s operations and management.\\u2019 \\nThe institute of internal auditors (IIA) also defines Internal Audit on \\nsimilar lines as:  \\n\\u2018Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and \\nconsulting activity designed to add value and improve an \\norganization\\u2019s operations. It helps an organization accomplish its \\nobjectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate \\nand improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and \\ngovernance processes.\\u2019 \\nThese definitions state two clear functions of the Internal Audit \\nactivity namely;  \\n\\uf0d8 Internal control: A process which is performed by the \\nemployees of the company as well as the information technology \\nsystems that are used to assist the company in achieving its \\nobjectives.  \\n\\uf0d8 Management tool: These monitors and evaluates the \\neffectiveness of operational processes and risk management of a \\ncompany [6]. \\nGoals of an audit  \\nThe simple goal of this complex process is to evaluate existing \\nactivities and documentation and determine if they meet the \\nestablished standards. An audit will evaluate the strengths and \\nweaknesses of quality control and quality assurance processes, the \\nresults of which will help us to improve processes and build a better \\nsystem for the benefit of the company. Every product manufactured \\nby a pharmaceutical company has characteristics that must be \\nquantified or qualified by laboratory tests. Quality control and \\nquality assurance are the necessary processes that play the role of \\ncontrol and balance system in pharmaceutical industry. \\nWith proper preparation and planning, the audit itself must easily \\nachieve the intended purpose. Effective auditing and proper \\ncompliance with standards will help build brand reputation and \\navoid the negative effects of non-compliance, such as fines, bad \\npublic relations and court proceedings [7]. \\nObjectives \\nAudit objectives may include:  \\n\\uf0a7 Evaluating conformity of requirements to ISO 9001 \\n\\uf0a7 Evaluating conformity of documentation to ISO 9001 \\nInternational Journal of Applied Pharmaceutics \\nISSN- 0975-7058                               Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019 \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n15 \\n\\uf0a7 Judging conformity of implementation to documentation \\n\\uf0a7 Determining effectiveness in meeting requirements and objectives \\n\\uf0a7 Meeting any contractual or regulatory requirements for auditing \\n\\uf0a7 Providing an opportunity to improve the quality management \\nsystem \\n\\uf0a7 Permitting registration and inclusion in a list of registered \\ncompanies \\n\\uf0a7 Qualifying potential suppliers [3] \\nAudits and regulatory standards \\nThe ISO, a global leader in the development of international \\nstandards, is instrumental in boosting interest in quality audits \\namong manufacturers and other types of businesses when it \\npublished the ISO 9000 standards in 1987. Today, popular standards \\nsuch as ISO 9001: 2000, ISO 14001:2004, and ISO 13485 all require \\ninternal audits of the quality system (or the environmental \\nmanagement system in the case of ISO 14001: 2004). Under these \\nstandards, audit serves as a mechanism for evaluating and \\nimproving quality. The same principle is reflected in a number of \\nregulations enforced by the Food and Drug Administration. Under \\nthe Quality System Regulation (21 Code of federal regulations [CFR] \\nPart 820), medical device manufacturers are required to conduct \\naudits to ensure that the quality system is compliant (Sec. \\n820.22). The current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) \\nregulations for pharmaceuticals (21 CFR Parts 210-211) and for \\nblood and blood components (21 CFR Part 606) include general \\nrequirements for regular evaluation of quality standards. Guidance \\nfor the pharmaceutical industry and blood establishments also \\nemphasize the importance of audits. For example, the \\u201cGuidance for \\nIndustry Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP \\nRegulations\\u201d recommends internal audits and supplier audits. The \\n\\u201cGuidelines for Quality Assurance in Blood Establishments\\u201d call for a \\ncomprehensive audit of the quality assurance program [5]. \\nBenefits of auditing \\nWhilst there is usually low influence on regulatory inspections, \\naudits should be seen as a management tool to assess the company\\u2019s \\nin-house quality management system. Internal, as well as external \\nauditing, can help to achieve this goal. The major benefits of an \\neffective audit system can be summarized as follows:  \\n\\u2022 Managing a quality management system \\n\\u2022 Detecting in advance weak points, through identification of \\nunsatisfactory trends or situations \\n\\u2022 Preventing quality failures, on the basis of quality data reviewing \\n\\u2022 Informing Senior Management about the quality level of facilities \\nand/or operations \\n\\u2022 Standardizing audits will optimize the output, the quality level of \\naudits will increase (and therefore the quality of products and \\nservices) which will finally lead to a continuous improvement loop. \\n\\u2022 The auditee will understand that audits are not created to \\ncontrol and criticize his work, but will improve the company's \\nperformance. This will lead to a higher acceptance of the audits. He \\nwill see audits as a chance to educate and improve his knowledge in \\nterms of quality related aspects. \\n\\u2022 Combining audits of quality, safety, and environmental matters \\nwill reduce the number of audits significantly which will give a \\ngreater acceptance to the auditee and will save his time. \\n\\u2022 Additional benefits can be achieved by pooling audits, for \\nexample, Shared Third Party Audits. \\n\\u2022 By establishing a high-quality audit system throughout the \\nindustry, the level of compliance will increase. Mutual confidence \\nbuilding and an improved relationship between the partners will be \\nthe result of these efforts [9]. \\nTypes of audits \\n1. Internal Audits \\nThe quality audit system mainly classified in three different \\ncategories:  \\n2. External Audits \\n3. Regulatory Audits \\nQuality audits are performed to verify the effectiveness of a quality \\nmanagement system. [5] \\nThis type of audit is also known as First-Party Audit or self-audit. \\nThose auditing and those being audited all belong to the same \\norganization. [1] Internal audit is a professional activity that consists \\nof advising organizations on how to achieve their goals in a better \\nway. The internal audit involves the use of a systematic methodology \\nto analyze business processes or organizational problems and \\nrecommend solutions. The main objectives of internal audits can be \\nsummarized as follows:  \\nInternal audit \\n1. To assist the internal control system. \\n2. Review of organizational policies and their operations. \\n3. Verify the accuracy and authenticity of errors and frauds. \\n4. Detection and prevention of errors and faults. \\n5. Safeguarding the assets \\n6. Applicability of accounting policies. \\n7. Helps in smooth functioning of the internal check system. \\nIn a pharmaceutical facility for internal auditing, one requires to \\ncheck mainly two things namely, \\n\\uf0fc Activities carried out by different departments and \\n\\uf0fc Documents maintained by these departments. \\nFor this purpose, a department-wise questionnaire and document \\nlist is required to be prepared in detail. [8] \\nThis type of audit is also known as Second-Party Audit. It refers to a \\ncustomer conducting an audit on a supplier or contractor. [1] \\nAlthough there are no strict legal requirements for this control. It is \\nalways advisable to evaluate the competence of the contractors in \\nwhich we produce our products or carry out the analysis of our \\nproducts or any other activity according to GMP. Performing these \\naudits also offers important commercial advantages:  \\nExternal audits \\n\\u2022 Develop knowledge and confidence in the partnership agreement \\n\\u2022 Ensures that requirements are understood and met \\n\\u2022 Allow the reduction of some activities (e. g. in-house quality \\ncontrol (QC) testing of starting materials) \\n\\u2022 reduce the risk of failure (and, by implication, its costs) \\nMany pharmaceutical industry suppliers are ISO 9001 or ISO 9002-\\ncertified and are regularly audited by their certification body. \\nPharmaceutical contract manufacturing or packaging companies will \\nneed to be licensed and will be subject to regulatory audits. [8] \\nThis type of audit is also known as Third-Party Audit. Neither \\ncustomer nor supplier conducts this type of audit. A regulatory \\nagency or independent body conducts a third party audit for \\ncompliance or certification or registration purposes. [1] \\nInternational regulatory bodies such as. Medicines and healthcare \\nproducts regulatory agency (MHRA), UK, United States food and \\ndrug administration (USFDA), Therapeutic goods administration \\n(TGA), Australia, Medicines control council (MCC), South Africa, etc. \\nare responsible for carrying out these checks. There is a team to \\nRegulatory audits \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n16 \\nperform the audit; it must be composed of audit inspectors and a \\nmultidisciplinary company team.  \\nThe company must have representatives from each of the following \\ndepartments: production, quality control, warehouse, maintenance, \\nadministration/personnel and marketing/sales. These audits can be \\nperformed without warning (MHRA currently performs around ten \\npercent of its inspections in the UK in this way) as manufacturers \\nare required to always comply with GMPs. Regulatory bodies in \\nother countries where products are sold can also audit companies \\n(e. g. FDA audits European manufacturers). \\nAll regulatory inspectors are extensively trained, competent and \\nprofessional. All MHRA inspectors are professionally qualified and \\nhave a minimum of five years of appropriate experience in a \\nproduction operation; they will be in the registers of persons eligible \\nto act as qualified persons and lead auditors. \\nFailure to approve a regulatory audit may result in restrictions (or \\nrevocation) of production or import/export license. (The FDA has \\nrecently imposed \\\"punitive consensus decrees\\\" on financial \\ncompanies that did not respond adequately to the audit results and \\ncomply with the GMPs). Therefore, it is essential that companies \\nhave defined processes for managing audits and staff should be \\nadequately trained for being audited. Internal audits can provide \\nvaluable opportunities for practice [8]. \\nPrinciples of auditing \\nThe audit is characterized by dependence on a number of principles. \\nThese principles should help to establish audit as an effective and \\nreliable tool to support management policies and controls, by \\nproviding information on what an organization can act to improve \\nits performance. Adherence to these principles is a prerequisite in \\norder to provide relevant and sufficient audit conclusions and allow \\nauditors to work independently from each other, to reach similar \\nconclusions in similar circumstances. \\na) Integrity: the basis of professionalism \\nThe auditors and the person who administers an audit program \\nmust:  \\n-Carry out their work with honesty, diligence, and responsibility;  \\n-Observe and comply with applicable legal requirements;  \\n-Demonstrate their competence while carrying out their work;  \\n-Be sensitive to any influence that can be exercised on the judgment \\nwhile conducting an audit. \\nb) Fair presentation: the obligation to report truthfully and \\naccurately \\nThe audit findings, audit conclusions and audit reports should \\ntruthfully and accurately reflect the activities of the audit. Significant \\nobstacles encountered during the audit and unresolved diverging \\nopinions between the audit team and the auditee should be \\nreported. The communication should be truthful, accurate, objective, \\ntimely, clear and complete. \\nc) Due professional care: the application of diligence and \\njudgment in auditing \\nAuditors should pay due attention to the importance of the task they \\nperform and the trust placed in them by the audit client and other \\ninterested parties. An important factor in the execution of work with \\ndue professional attention is having the ability to express reasoned \\njudgments in all audit situations. \\nd) Confidentiality: security of information \\nAuditors should exercise discretion in the use and protection of \\ninformation acquired in the course of exercising their duties. Audit \\ninformation should not be used inappropriately for personal gain by \\nthe auditor or the audit client, or in a manner detrimental to the \\nlegitimate interests of the auditee. This concept includes the correct \\nmanagement of sensitive or confidential information. \\ne) Independence: the basis for the impartiality of the audit and \\nthe objectivity of the audit conclusions \\nThe auditors should be independent of the activity audited wherever \\npossible, and in all cases, they should act in a manner that is free \\nfrom prejudice and conflicts of interest. For internal audits, auditors \\nmust be independent of the operational managers of the function \\nbeing audited. Auditors must maintain objectivity throughout the \\nreview process to ensure that audit findings and conclusions are \\nbased only on audit evidence. \\nFor small organizations, internal auditors may not be totally \\nindependent of the activity being audited, but all efforts must be \\nmade to eliminate bias and encourage objectivity. \\nf) Evidence-based approach: the rational method for \\nachieving reliable and reproducible audit conclusions in a \\nsystematic audit process \\nAudit evidence must be verifiable. In general, it will be based on \\nsamples of available information, since an audit is conducted in a \\nlimited period of time and with limited resources. An appropriate \\nuse of sampling should be applied, as it is closely related to the \\nconfidence that can be included in the audit conclusions [10]. \\nThe auditor within the audit system  \\nAn auditor is defined by ISO 19011 as a person with the competence \\nto perform an audit. To perform an audit, the auditor must be \\nauthorized for that particular audit. \\nAuditor's responsibility \\nThe auditor has the following responsibilities:  \\n\\uf0a7 Assist in the selection of the team and inform the team \\n\\uf0a7 Responsibility to plan and manage all phases of the audit \\n\\uf0a7 Represent the audit team with the auditee \\n\\uf0a7 Control conflicts and manage difficult situations \\n\\uf0a7 Direct and control all meetings with the team and the auditee \\n\\uf0a7 Make decisions about audit issues and the quality system \\n\\uf0a7 Report the results of the audit without delay \\n\\uf0a7 Report the main obstacles encountered \\n\\uf0a7 Report critical non-conformances immediately \\n\\uf0a7 Possesses effective communication skills \\nManaging an audit program \\nAn audit program may include one or more audits, depending on the \\nsize, nature, and complexity of the organization to be audited. These \\naudits may have a variety of objectives and may also include joint \\n(multiple auditing organizations) or combined (Quality management \\nand Environmental management systems) audits. Management of an \\naudit program includes all the activities necessary for planning and \\norganizing the types and number of audits, and for providing \\nresources for conducting them effectively and efficiently within the \\nspecified time frames [fig. 1]. \\nThe organization\\u2019s top management should grant the authority for \\nmanaging the audit program. Those assigned the responsibility for \\nmanaging the audit program should:  \\n1. Plan, establish, implement, monitor, review and improve the \\naudit program \\n2. Identify the necessary resources and ensure they are provided. \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n17 \\n \\nFig. 1: Managing an audit program\\u2013process flow [3] \\n \\n \\nFig. 2: Various steps of audit activities [3] \\n \\nThe planning and conducting of audit activities involve the following \\nprocess flow or life cycle: as is depicted in Fig. 2. [3]. \\nAudit activities \\nInformation gathering \\nWhat is information? \\nInformation is simply the facts or knowledge provided or learned. It \\ncan be tacit, in people's heads, or explicit, in documents-electronic or \\nhard copy [11]. \\nDuring the audit, information relevant to the objectives, scope and \\ncriteria, including information on interfaces between functions, \\nactivities and processes, should be collected by appropriate \\nsampling and should be verified. Only verifiable information can be \\naudit evidence which must be recorded [3]. \\nAudit evidence is any information used by the auditor to determine \\nif the audited information is in accordance with the established \\ncriteria and to arrive at the conclusions on which the audit opinion is \\nbased. Internal Audit Evidence includes any data, information, \\nprocess flows, vouchers, bills, memos, contracts or transactions.  \\nThe internal audit evidence collected would be dependent on the \\nfollowing:  \\n\\uf0d8 Audit procedures to use-specific procedures should be spelled \\nout for instruction during the audit. \\n\\uf0d8 Sample size-how many items should be tested for each audit \\nprocedure.  \\n\\uf0d8 Items to select-determine which items in the population should \\nbe selected.  \\n\\uf0d8 Timing-timing can vary from the beginning of the accounting \\nperiod to the closure of it [6]. \\nMethods of gathering audit information \\nThere are six basic methods of gathering information during an \\naudit. Depending on the type of information that needs to be \\nobtained, the Internal Auditor will need to determine which method, \\nor combination of methods, should be used. \\nInterviews \\nInterviewing is a powerful data collection technique, which works \\nwell on its own and is often used to support other techniques, such \\nas observation. The interviewee\\u2019s insights can guide the Internal \\nAuditor\\u2019s decisions about what to observe. The most important thing \\nto remember when interviewing is to always talk to the right person, \\nas it can save a lot of time and confusion.  \\nCommunication is a key element to the success of any audit. The more \\neffectively the Internal Auditor interviews personnel, the more useful \\ninformation will be gathered. Questions may be asked several times in \\ndifferent ways or to different people depending on their level of \\nresponsibility (Operator, Supervisor, etc.) in order to get a complete \\nanswer. \\nInspections \\nWhen inspecting something, it is good practice to start with general \\nobservations and then proceeding to the more specific elements. First, \\nthe Internal Auditor will have a good overall look around the facility and \\nthen examine specific items more closely, noting anything that does not \\nseem quite right. It is important to ask questions throughout the \\ninspection. If a problem is found, the Internal Auditor must investigate \\n(dig deeper) to explore the extent of the finding.  \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n18 \\nReviewing documents \\nWhen reviewing company records, the Internal Auditor can use a \\nnumber of techniques. Random sampling is one of them. It gives a \\ngeneral idea of the quality of record keeping and exposes the \\npotential problem areas. However, one sample taken in one given \\nperiod of time is usually not enough to form accurate conclusions. \\nAnother important aspect of record keeping is clarity. Documents \\nshould be clear regardless of who reads them. Details vary but, in \\ngeneral, every document should carry a title, an owner and a \\nrevision status. If any of this information is missing, the Internal \\nAuditor should ask why. The revisions noted should be checked \\nagainst the master record. Changes must be authorized, signed and \\ndated by an authorized person. \\nObservations \\nThe simplest way to check how a process works is to observe it in \\naction. Observing a routine activity for a couple of hours can give the \\nInternal Auditor the opportunity to see how something is done \\nunder normal circumstances. He or she should ask questions about \\nwhat they see, making sure at all times not to interfere with the \\nprocesses they are observing, as that may cause the personnel not to \\ncarry out their tasks as they usually do. \\nVertical tracking  \\nThis method is also referred to as \\u201cvertical auditing\\u201d and consists of \\nfollowing a specific development from the beginning until the end, \\nsimultaneously checking all the records that are produced in the \\nprocess. Applying the vertical tracking technique can lead the \\nInternal Auditor to areas that were not initially part of the scope, but \\nit does facilitate a bigger picture view, as this allows the Internal \\nAuditor to see how the various parts of a given program work \\ntogether. \\nExercises \\nThe aim of an exercise is to test something that is usually done at the \\nfacility as part of the routine. However, the Internal Auditor gets to \\npick the time and the circumstances for the test. The subject of \\ntesting can be the personnel, the program, or the equipment. An \\nInternal Auditor should not run an exercise without the knowledge \\nand cooperation of the auditee. Doing so is likely to have negative \\nconsequences as unannounced actions may breach certain facility-\\nspecific rules or regulations which the Internal Auditor is unaware of.  \\nTaking notes \\nA good Internal Auditor must have his or her own efficient way of \\ntaking notes. This is an extremely important part of the job that \\ncannot be neglected. Notes must get reviewed and refined along the \\nway. In situations where taking notes is inconvenient, a mental note-\\ntaking technique should be used. Notes are used to organize \\nthoughts and observations which will, in turn, help the Internal \\nAuditor reach accurate conclusions throughout the audit. Notes need \\nto be reviewed and completed at the end of each audit day [12]. \\n \\n \\nFig. 3: Process for collecting information to reach audit conclusions [3] \\n \\nAdministration \\nThe internal audit team must have the confidence and trust of the \\nkey stakeholders it works with and be seen as a credible source of \\nassurance and advice. This confidence should not be assumed and \\ncan only be established and maintained by having an effective \\nworking relationship, by delivering high-quality and timely advice \\nand internal audit reports that are seen to be contributing directly to \\nassisting the organisation to meet its responsibilities. The key \\nstakeholders of internal audit are:  \\n\\u2022Chief Executive \\n\\u2022Board of Directors \\n\\u2022Audit Committee \\n\\u2022Senior management \\n\\u2022External auditor \\n\\u2022Other reviewers \\nThe importance of these individual relationships is analysed below. \\na) Chief executive \\nWhile internal audit reports functionally to the Audit Committee, it \\nis important that the Head of Internal Audit has direct access, as and \\nwhen required, to the Chief Executive. \\nOrganisations today, recognize the advantages in making the Head of \\nInternal Audit directly accountable to the Chief Executive. This not \\nonly sends a clear signal about the importance of the internal audit \\nfunction, it also facilitates regular contact between the Chief \\nExecutive and internal audit. This contact should be used as an \\nopportunity to gain insights into new and emerging risks and issues \\nfacing the organisation and to discuss the role the Chief Executive \\nexpects internal audit to fulfill in the company. \\nb) Board of directors \\nThe Head of Internal Audit may formally report to the Board of \\nDirectors on the effectiveness of the internal audit function in order \\nto exchange views and ideas. As the Audit Committee is usually a \\nsub-committee of the Board, this responsibility is often delegated to \\nthe Audit Committee. As a minimum, it is important that the Head of \\nInternal Audit has direct access to the Chair of the Board and the \\nChief Executive, as and when required. \\nc) Audit committee \\nAudit Committees play an integral role in the governance framework \\nof organizations. It assists Chief Executives and Boards to \\nunderstand whether key controls are appropriate and operating \\neffectively. In this respect, the relationship between internal audit \\nand the Audit Committee is crucial and has a number of dimensions \\nwhich are mentioned below:  \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n19 \\na) Advise the Chief Executive about the internal audit plans of the \\norganisation;  \\nb) Direct or coordinate work programs relating to internal and \\nexternal audits;  \\nc) Review the content of internal [and external] audits to identify \\nsignificant matters of concern, and to advise the Chief Executive on \\ngood practice or opportunities for improvement;  \\nd) Review the adequacy of responses to reports of internal and \\nexternal audits;  \\ne) Endorse the internal audit charter and be responsible for either \\nreviewing and approving internal audit plans or recommending \\ntheir approval by the Chief Executive/Board of Directors;  \\nf) Act as the internal audit function\\u2019s primary client and form a \\nsound professional relationship with the internal audit team as a \\nwhole and each of its members;  \\ng) Utilize internal audit reports and its general interaction with the \\nInternal Audit team, to assess the effectiveness of controls and the \\nperformance of the organisation and \\nh) Utilize the internal audit function to undertake secretariat \\ncompliance \\nGiven this relationship, it is important that both formal and informal \\nlines of communication be maintained between internal audit and \\nthe Audit Committee and with individual committee members, \\nparticularly the Chair. Audit Committee members should be in a \\nposition to be able to openly discuss matters of interest with the \\nHead of Internal Audit. It is also good practice for the Audit \\nCommittee to meet privately with the Head of Internal Audit from \\ntime to time to ask questions and to seek feedback from internal \\naudit without management being present. This practice also \\nsupports the independent role of internal audit. \\nd) Senior management \\nTo effectively fulfill its responsibilities, it is important that internal \\naudit has a professional and constructive relationship with senior \\nmanagement of the organization. Internal auditors should interact on a \\nregular basis with members of the senior management team, and \\nthrough the delivery of practical, business-focused and useful reports \\nand advice, build a relationship that is based on cooperation, \\ncollaboration and mutual respect. Meetings with organization \\nmanagers should be used as an opportunity to be briefed on key \\nbusiness developments and associated risks facing the organization. \\nThese meetings should also be used to obtain informal feedback about \\nthe performance of internal audit and to assist in identifying ways that \\ninternal audit can best assist organization management. Thus, the \\ninternal audit team would encourage managers to seek their advice \\nand assistance on either an informal or formal basis as the need arises. \\ne) External auditors \\nExternal auditors too must help in developing internal audit strategy \\nand internal audit work plan. Both audit teams need to address the \\nkey financial and business systems underpinning the company's \\nfinancial statements and to avoid duplication of compliance and \\nassurance. To avoid such duplication, the external auditor must \\nevaluate the work of the internal audit function to determine its \\nadequacy for external audit purposes. The Internal audit function \\ncan be made responsible for liaising with external auditor on behalf \\nof the organization. Such a role can be a useful way for an internal \\naudit team to be aware of planned and actual external audit \\ncoverage. Thus, a constructive relationship between both sets of \\nauditors assists in the conduct of external audits. Such a role can \\nonly be fulfilled when there is healthy communication between \\ninternal and external audit teams which can be achieved by setting \\nup formally establish meetings between internal and external audit \\nto allow for a routine exchange of information. \\nf) Other reviewers \\nInternal audit is one of a number of internal and external review and \\nassurance activities that exist as part of an organization\\u2019s \\ngovernance arrangements. The company shall benefit when all these \\nactivities, such as those performed by the Ombudsman and \\nregulators, operate in a coordinated and complementary manner to \\nthe greatest extent possible. This requires regular formal and \\ninformal contact between review bodies to minimize duplication \\nand overlap. Some organisations see a benefit in protocols being \\nformalised for such activities: providing, for example, for the regular \\nexchange of views and information and for the reporting of the \\nresults of work undertaken in a coordinated manner. Protocols can \\nbe particularly important in situations where internal audit needs to \\nwork closely with other entities as a result of inter-agency or other \\nagreements. [6] \\nAudit planning procedures  \\nIn order to conduct an audit effectively and efficiently, the work \\nneeds to be planned and controlled. The form and nature of the \\nplanning required for an audit will be affected by the size and \\ncomplexity of the enterprise, the commercial environment in which \\nit operates, the methods of processing transactions and the \\nreporting requirements to which it is subjected.  \\nAudit planning is the formulation of the general strategy for audit \\nwhich sets the direction for the audit, describes the expected scope \\nand conduct of the audit and provides guidance for the development \\nof the audit program.  \\nAdequate planning of an audit work aims at  \\na. Establishing the intended means of achieving the objectives of \\nthe audit  \\nb. Assisting in the direction and control of the work  \\nc. Helping to ensure that attention is devoted to critical aspects of \\nthe audit work  \\nd. Ensuring that the work is completed expeditiously  \\ne. Facilitating review of the audit work  \\nf. Helping to assign the proper tasks to members of the audit team \\nand coordinates outside experts. \\nThe audit plan  \\nThe auditor should develop an audit plan for the audit in order to reduce \\naudit risk to an acceptably low level. The audit plan is more detailed than \\nthe overall audit strategy and includes the nature, timing, and extent of \\naudit procedures to be performed by engagement team members in \\norder to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to reduce audit risk \\nto an acceptably low level. Documentation of the audit plan also serves \\nas a record of the proper planning and performance of the audit \\nprocedures that can be reviewed and approved prior to the performance \\nof further audit procedures. [13] \\nPlanning objectives \\n\\\"The objective of the auditor is to plan the audit so that it will be \\nperformed in an effective manner.\\\" Audits are potentially complex, \\nrisky and expensive processes. Although firms have internal \\nmanuals and standardized procedures, it is vital that engagements \\nare planned to ensure that the auditor:  \\n\\u2022 Devotes appropriate attention to important areas of the audit;  \\n\\u2022 Identifies and resolves potential problems on a timely basis;  \\n\\u2022 Organizes and manages the audit so that it is performed in an \\neffective and efficient manner;  \\n\\u2022 Selects team members with appropriate capabilities and \\ncompetencies;  \\n\\u2022 Directs and supervises the team and reviews their work; and \\n\\u2022 Effectively coordinates the work of others, such as experts and \\ninternal audit. \\nThe purpose of all this is to ensure that the risk of performing a poor \\nquality audit (and ultimately giving an inappropriate audit opinion) \\nis reduced to an acceptable level [14]. \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n20 \\nThe steps in planning an audit include (Planning Procedures\\n1. \\n): \\nBasic discussions with the client \\n2. \\nabout the nature of the \\nengagement are performed first, and the auditor meets the key \\nemployees or new employees of a continuing client. The overall \\naudit strategy or the timing of the audit may also be discussed. \\nReview of audit documentation \\n3. \\nfrom previous audits \\nperformed by the accounting firm or a predecessor auditor (if the \\nlatter makes these audit documentation available) will assist in \\ndeveloping an outline of the audit program. \\nAsk about recent developments \\n4. \\nin the company such as \\nmergers and new product lines which will cause the audit to differ \\nfrom earlier years. \\nInterim financial statements are analyzed to identify accounts \\nand transactions that differ from expectations (based on factors such \\nas budgets or prior periods). The performance of such analytical \\nprocedures is mandatory \\n5. \\nin the planning of an audit to identify \\naccounts that may be misstated and that deserve special emphasis in \\nthe audit program. \\nNon-audit personnel \\n6. \\nof the accounting firm who have provided \\nservices (such as tax preparation) to the client should be identified \\nand consulted to learn more about the client. \\nStaffing \\n7. \\nfor the audit should be determined and a meeting held \\nto discuss the engagement. \\nTiming \\n8. \\nof the various audit procedures should be determined \\nOutside assistance needs should be determined, including the \\nuse of a specialist \\n9. \\nas required and the determination of the extent of \\ninvolvement of the internal auditors of the client. \\nPronouncements \\n10. \\non accounting principles and audit guides \\nshould be read or reviewed to assist in the development of complete \\naudit programs fitting the unique needs of the industry. \\nScheduling with the client \\nThe internal audit work plan would generally include:  \\nis needed to coordinate \\nactivities.[15] \\n1. Audit title \\n2. Functional and Operational Area to be covered \\n3. Director and manager responsible \\n4. Type and scope of internal audit \\n5. The benefit expected by the audit procedure \\n6. Resources allocation for the purpose of the audit \\n7. Proposed duration and timelines for completion [6] \\nAuditing procedure \\nThere are total 10 steps of the audit process:  \\n1. Notification: Audit process begins with notification. The \\nnotification process alerts the party to be audited of the date and \\ntime of the process. The notification also will list the documents that \\nthe order wishes to review in order to understand the organization \\nof the company. \\n2. Planning: Planning is the steps the auditor takes, before the audit, \\nto identify key areas of risk and areas of concern. \\n3. Opening meeting: Meeting between the auditing staff and senior \\nmanagement of the auditing target as well as administrative staff. \\nThe auditors will describe the process they will undertake. \\nManagement will describe areas of concern to them and the \\nschedule of the employees that must be consulted.  \\n4. Fieldwork: Fieldwork begins after the results of the meeting are \\nused to adjust the final audit plans. Employees are notified of the \\naudit, schedules are drawn up regarding the activities of the audit \\nstaff, and an initial investigation begun after learning of business \\nprocedures, interviewing key staff, testing current business \\npractices by sampling, reviewing the law and testing internal rules \\nand practices for reasonableness. \\n5. Communication: The audit team should consistently be in \\ncontact with the corporate auditor to clarify processes, gain access \\nto documents and clarify procedures. \\n6. Draft audit: At the completion of the audit, the next step, the draft \\naudit, is prepared. The draft audit detail what was done and what \\nwas found, a distribution list of parties to receive preliminary \\nresults, and a list of concerns. \\n7. Management response: The draft is given to management to \\nreview, edit and suggest changes, probe areas of concern and correct \\nerrors. Upon making final corrections, the report is given to \\nmanagement for the seventh step, the management response. \\nManagement is requested to answer the report by stating whether \\nthey agree with the problems cited, the plan to correct noted problem \\nand the expected date by which all issues will have been addressed. \\n8. Final meeting: The final meeting is designed to close loose ends, \\ndiscuss the management response and address the scope of the \\naudit. \\n9. Report distribution: The ninth step is the report distribution, \\nwhere the final audit report is sent to appropriate officials inside \\nand outside the audit area.  \\n10. Feedback: The last step is the audit feedback whereby the \\naudited company implements the recommended changes and the \\nauditor's review and test the quality, adherence and effects of the \\nadopted changes. This continues until all issues are adopted and the \\nnext audit cycle begins. [1] \\nAs the audit proceeds, there might arise some situations where the \\nfacts indicate there is a failure, either partially or wholly, of the \\nquality management system, such a situation is \\ncalled \\nRecording nonconformities or deficiencies \\nnonconformity\\u201d. \\n\\uf0a7 a condition adverse to Quality \\nWhat is nonconformity? \\n\\uf0a7 The non-fulfillment of a requirement \\n1. The procedure or defined process does not conform to the \\nregulatory requirements \\nThere may be nonconformity for one of three reasons \\n2. The procedure or process has not been put into practice in the \\ndescribed way \\n3. The practice, what is actually done, is not effective (planned \\nresults not achieved). \\nThe statement of nonconformity needs to be in a format \\nunderstandable both to people in the audit and to those who were \\nnot. People who were not present at the audit will be assigned to \\ntake the necessary corrective action most often. This need alone \\ndefines some rules for the recording of nonconformities:  \\n1. Exact observation of the facts. Only the facts are needed, and \\nthe reporting of them needs to be exact. \\n2. Where was it found? The statement needs to identify exactly \\nwhere it was found; otherwise, it may not be found again. \\n3. What was found? It needs to be clear so that people understand \\nwhat aspect of the system is nonconforming. \\n4. Why is it nonconformity? The statement needs to make it clear \\nwhat specified requirement has not been met. \\n5. What is the objective evidence of the nonconformity? What \\naudit evidence do we have\\u2013records, documents, statements or \\nobservations for our nonconformity findings? \\n6. Who was involved? The statement often has no need to involve \\nspecific people, but where the objective evidence was based on a \\nAgarwal et al. \\nInt J App Pharm, Vol 11, Issue 1, 2019, 14-22 \\n \\n21 \\nstatement, and then the statement and the originator (s) need to be \\nclear. Job titles rather than names should be used. \\n7. Use local terminology. Industry has its own names for certain \\nactivities, documents, etc. These unique terms should be used for clarity. \\n8. Make it retrievable. Someone has to go back after the audit and \\nput it right, possibly after a considerable period of time. \\n9. Make it helpful. To be helpful, nonconformity statements \\nshould be complete, correct, concise and clear. Suggestions, \\nparticularly on external audits, are not recommended, nor are they \\nthe auditor\\u2019s duty [3]. \\nClassification of deficiencies \\nThe number of nonconformities that can arise during an audit can be \\nnumerous. Following types of defects are identified during an \\ninternal audit and these are helpful in regulatory compliance:  \\nCritical defect \\nCritical defects have a high probability of resulting in a product \\nrecall or in an adverse physiological response by the consumer. \\nCritical deficiencies found in internal audits that usually produce \\nsignificant effects on the strength, identity, safety, and purity of the \\nproduct that will be considered during regulatory compliance. \\nThe possible source of a critical defect \\n\\u2022 Cross-contamination of materials of the product \\n\\u2022 Incorrect labeling \\n\\u2022 Active ingredients outside of specifications \\n\\u2022 Product manufactured according to obsolete or unapproved \\nprocedures \\n\\u2022 Open sterile products located in a non-aseptic area \\n\\u2022 Untrained operators working in the sterile filling area \\n\\u2022 Contaminated purified water or water for injection system \\nMajor defect \\nMajor defects found during the internal audit can reduce the \\nusability or stability of a product, but without causing harm to the \\nconsumer. \\nThe possible source of a major defect \\n\\u2022 Major equipment not calibrated or out of calibration \\n\\u2022 Inadequate segregation of quarantine components \\n\\u2022 Inadequate evaluation of production process outside of action \\nlevels \\n\\u2022 Process deviations not properly documented or investigated \\n\\u2022 Operator not trained in or familiar with the standard operating \\nprocedures \\n\\u2022 Preventive maintenance on a critical water system not conducted \\naccording to schedule \\n\\u2022 Lack of standard operating procedures for cleaning equipment. \\n\\u2022 Audits of a contract manufacturer not conducted \\nMinor defect \\nMinor defects have a low probability of affecting the quality or \\nusability of the product which can help in regulatory compliance. \\nPossible source of the minor defect \\n\\u2022 Failure to complete all batch record entries \\n\\u2022 Warehouse not cleaned according to schedule \\n\\u2022 Cracks in wall surfaces \\n\\u2022 Failures to correct documentation errors properly \\n\\u2022 Operator uniform not properly worn \\n\\u2022 Standard operating procedure review is overdue \\n\\u2022 Adhesive tape used on manufacturing equipment \\n\\u2022 Laboratory buffer solutions are obsolete [16] \\nCONCLUSION \\nA quality systems approach calls for audits to be conducted at \\nplanned intervals to evaluate effective implementation and \\nmaintenance of the quality system and to determine if processes and \\nproducts meet established parameters and specifications. An audit \\nperformed by a well-trained and thoroughly prepared auditor can be \\nhighly beneficial by identifying areas for genuine improvement. An \\naudit should not to be seen as interrogation with the auditee as \\npermanent loser, it is a comparison of what is laid down to what is in \\nplace. Auditing is no goal in itself. Auditing in the pharmaceutical \\nsector serves two different categories: regulatory compliance and \\nbusiness needs. When employees and managers begin to see audits \\nas opportunities to improve, they begin to see auditors not as police \\nofficers but as productive members of the organization. \\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \\nNil \\nAUTHORS CONTRIBUTIONS \\nAll the authors have contributed equally \\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS \\nNone \\nREFERENCES \\n1.

Problem Statement\\nThe last three years have been problematic for Argentine agribusinesses given that\\nthe economical crisis of December 2002 has strongly affected them; however, it\\nforced farmers and processors to look for new alternatives. Instead of domestic\\nmarket, export appears as an advantageous opportunity because of disparity in the\\ndollar / peso rate, among others.

Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\ninternational level requires building competitive advantages linking quality and\\norigin and/or food safety and quality assurance management as key drivers of\\nagribusiness.\\nIn the food chain, the development of food safety is mandatory while quality\\nassurance is voluntary. It is not the same to implement food safety such as: GMP ,\\nSSOP , HACCP  and/or others, that assures the consumption of food is safe, than to\\nimplement quality assurance such as: ISO  9000 Standards, total quality\\nmanagement or continues improvement, which are quality assurance systems\\nsatisfying customers\\u2019 implicit and explicit expectations . By all means, to the food\\nindustry, food safety is a pathway to quality management, and both are essential\\ntechnological innovations for competitiveness.\\nIn the domestic market, the perception of the needs of food safety and quality\\nassurance -as strategy of competitiveness by the Small and Medium Sized Food\\nIndustry- is recent. This requirement has been promoted by the globalization\\nprocess, new markets penetration, exports increasing, consumers\\u2019 satisfaction, and\\nby world-wide dissemination, as competitive advantages and, in some cases, as\\npara-technical barriers.\\nThe current situation in Argentina related to food safety shows that just 35 beef\\nslaughterhouses, 12 poultry, eggs and hunting products industries, and 300 fishing\\n-factory vessels, have been GMP and HACCP audited and approved by the\\nArgentine National Inspection Services, the European Union, and the United\\nStates. Those statistics point out an increase since more than three years ago\\nHACCP approvals in the Argentine food industry were not more than 20. The\\nscenario of quality assurance is less optimistic because only 15% of the 450 ISO\\ncertified industries belong to a food industry sector.\\nThat proves in despite of sharing the same institutional and organizational frame,\\nnew technological designs emerge from that uncertain economic scenario, allowing a\\nrealistic study of the effectiveness and efficiency of Argentine agribusinesses and its\\nnew and potential alternatives.\\nAt the time of deciding any new technological system, the restrictions and obstacles\\nare common to most medium and small sized food industries around the world,\\nincluding human, economical and technological resources deficiency:\\n\\uffff  \\\"\\u2026inadequate basic hygiene,\\n\\uffff  inadequate infrastructure and facilities\\n\\uffff  financial limits,\\n\\uffff  lack of knowledge of the business\\n\\uffff  lack of skill and information,I.

The cases\\nunder study are introducing technological designs as food safety and quality\\nassurance systems\\u2013with third party or self certification- generating new business\\nunderneath of both a chaotic domestic market and a competitive international one.\\nThe three experiences selected for this comparative analysis are confronting the\\naforementioned obstacles at different organizational levels and in different\\ntechnological models. They are developing:\\n\\uffff  GMP and HACCP in the lamb slaughterhouse,\\n\\uffff  Green Beef Quality Protocol \\u2013 Good Cattle Practices and Traceability-, in the\\nCattle Farms, Quality Management -ISO 9001/2000 Standard- in Private\\nPort (Grain & Cereal Reception \\u2013Quality Homogenization \\u2013 Identity\\nPreservation - Ship Load) Service.\\nThe common purpose of those agribusinesses' leaders is to develop strategic and\\ncompetitive advantages based on food safety and quality assurance. The\\nmanagement recognized the need of leading a cultural change inside the\\norganization \\u2013in the human resources area- and found out that the technological\\napproach, as a common goal, would drive it. They chose those new designs as a\\npathway to accomplish the workforce commitment with a precise objective.\\n2. Objective\\nThe main objective of the paper is to make a comparative analysis of three cases\\nunder study. Agribusinesses developing new technological models are focused on the\\nevaluation of food safety and quality assurance systems related to strategic and\\ncompetitive advantages. The result of that analysis allows also evaluating impacts\\non the food chain under the light of the agribusinesses\\u2019 new vision and values.\\nExternal limitations and internal restraints are expected as a result of the complex\\neconomical scenario and precarious strategic alliances under which those\\nagribusinesses are inserted.\\n3.

The farmers also self-constituted the\\nshareholders of Patagonia Sur slaughterhouse, which is processing sheep\\nfrom Patagonia. They settled a strategic alliance with the provincial\\ngovernment \\u2013owner of the slaughterhouse and the plant manager \\u2013\\nresponsible for the concession. This slaughterhouse is implementing GMP\\nand HACCP in order to meet the terms of the European Union requirements\\nto keep the current market and to increase the exports volume of Estancias\\nde Patagonia\\u2019s farmers.\\n\\uffff  The second case is on beef agribusiness, located in the \\u201cpampas,\\u201d an\\nimportant cattle area in Buenos Aires hinterland called \\u201cCuenca del Salado\\u201d.\\nThis case is about creating network of certified cattle suppliers-- a consortium\\nof origin and quality assurance--that meets organic and natural meat\\nattributes. The group of farmers is developing good cattle practices (GCP),\\nincluding features such as: genetic, animal reproduction, natural grass feed,\\nhandling, and animal health and welfare, all under the Product and Process\\u2019s\\nQuality Protocol. They also are developing traceability starting with\\nindividual identification and a database network. The system might need a\\nthird party certification.\\n\\uffff  The last case is grain and cereal stocking and ship loading, private port\\nservice at Terminal Quequen, located in Buenos Aires Province. The process\\nof the service includes reception, storage, and quality homogenization,\\nidentity preservation (IP) and ship load. Historically, it was a government-\\nrun organization and after privatization, it became a private company. The\\ninvolved actors are shareholders owning the plant and a manager with\\nprivate sector management\\u2019s skill, managing the plant. Because of the\\nincomes and the complex interaction between workers with different\\nbackground, the manager\\u2019s decision is to implement the strategic plan and\\nISO 9001/2000 with the main purpose of transforming the \\u201chuman resources\\u201d\\nin \\u201csocial Capital\\u201d like competitive assets, by means of ISO\\u2019s certification.\\n3.1. Food Safety - Self-control ProgramI. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\n\\u201cEstancias de Patagonia SA\\\" is a group of farmers from Santa Cruz, Patagonia\\u00b4s\\ntrademark, and through a strategic alliance they become the shareholders of the\\nSlaughterhouse \\u201cPatagonia Sur\\u201d where their sheep and lambs are processed.\\nProvincial Government owns the plant, and it had been given in concession to a\\ncontractor who also is the manager. The farmers-government-manager partnership\\nis important in the light of decision making. Meaning that all the partners decided\\nto implement GMP and HACCP in the slaughterhouse to meet the European Union\\nrequirements in order to keep the current market and increase the volume of its\\nexports to the European Union, the United States and Japan.\\nThe partners bet on food safety system with the main purpose of adding value to\\ntheir products, as first step, and planning ISO 9001(vs 2000) certification, as a next\\nstep. Although aware that they are a sort of collective strategy (farmers, industry\\nmanagement and government) with a win-win relationship and common interest,\\nnot all of them have deeply understood the main purpose. Thus, they decided\\nstarting with a technological model that would provoke the cultural crash and the\\nensuing change.\\nThe Design and Implementation of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point\\nSystem (HACCP) Proposal is a part of previous project called \\u201cLamb from\\nPatagonia, Santa Cruz, Denomination of Origin.\\u201d It was financially supported by\\nthe Provincial Government and technically assisted by the university in 2000/2001.\\nThe university with the co-ordination of the National Inspection Service\\n(government financing University assistance) assists this new proposal, based on\\nHACCP Design 2002. The contractor financially supports all the investment and\\nexpenditures related to implementation of the self-control program.\\n\\u201cPatagonia Sur\\u201d annual outcome is around 150,000 sheep and lambs. However, the\\nfactory slaughters hares from May to August, the most profitable activity, lamb\\nprocessing, starts in December and ends by April. The plant has almost 200\\nemployees, 40 of which are permanent and the rest are temporary. This is a key\\nissue since HACCP needs trained personnel and on account of workers\\u2019 transitory\\ncondition, training must be made earlier every year.\\nThe Good Manufacture Practices and Sanitation Standard Operative Procedures\\nare the food hygiene and correct manipulation prerequisites required in both\\ndomestic and international markets. Those prerequisites have been essential to\\nprocess safe food for human consumption. They also are useful tools to the design of\\nslaughterhouses and the operative processes of safe food.\\nThe HACCP System is founded on those prerequisites and consequently has become\\nworldwide food safety\\u2019s synonymous, being to both industry and governments\\nrequired standards. The HACCP provides systematic and proactive evaluation ofI. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nfood safety because it defines potential hazards: biological, chemical and physical,\\nwhich can jeopardize consumer\\u2019s health.\\nA successful HACCP Plan means a settled and proved system by SENASA, a\\nnational or international third party certification and approval by the inspection\\nservices of the United States and/or the European Union. Currently, SENASA is\\nalso requiring not only HACCP (by June of 2003), but also the ISO 9001 rule\\u2019s\\ncertification by 2005. It is offering a stable institutional framework to those who\\nhave invested in food safety and would have to invest in quality assurance.\\n3.1.1 Introducing HACCP System: Phase of Application\\nThe process of implementation began with a first inspection and evaluation audit,\\ndriven by SENASA, to define the current situation and the following methodology.\\nMany hygienic and sanitary hazards were found in the process, caused by\\ninadequate and old infrastructure dating back more than 30 years, low employees\\u2019\\ncompetence and serious cross contamination difficulties due to operative process\\nflow.\\nThe implementation selected method was the progressive one taking into account\\nslaughterhouse\\u2019s features, manager and employees\\u2019 availability, and SENASA and\\ndifferent countries\\u2019 mandatory specifications and requirements. This method has\\nallowed initiating activities simultaneously knowing HACCP plan requires many\\ninvestments that must be decided by the manager.\\nIn order to develop process performance, the process\\u2019s critical limits are listed and\\ndefined, such as: temperature, time, and pH, among others, respecting its\\nparameter range, allowing the process to be under control. Because there is no\\nmicrobiological standard reference in the world, it is required to register the meat\\npacker data at least for more of 3 years and to analyze the trend in order to define\\nthe factory standard.\\nOnce the Critical Control Points (CCP) are agreed, they must be constantly\\nmeasured through analysis and/or visual observations, which are verified  in\\nnormal conditions, assuring the process can be maintained and that it is realistic.\\nThe statistical methodology is used to verify that the process stays under control in\\nthose conditions. During the verification, it is also demonstrated whether the\\nprocess is able to reach the defined control criteria (critical limit).\\nAs a result, the manager encouraged his supervisors to search for hygiene and cross\\ncontamination due to failure of infrastructure and incorrect manipulation focusing\\non the plant flow, the operative process and the product. Major investment was\\nmade and changes introduced since this process started but there are still manyI. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\ninfrastructure repairs, hardware and software innovations, and technical changes\\npending.\\n3.1.2  Phase of Human Resources Structural Changes\\nOne of the most common causes of process failures is the lack of commitment, which\\ncan be only driven by the leader. For that reason it is necessary to focus on training\\nand dissemination as the adequate tools to provoke motivation and increase\\ncompetence as well. By all means, training was highlighted from the beginning,\\neven though it has continued through the whole process. The shareholders have\\nattended dissemination meetings because at the moment of decision making their\\nawareness of the HACCP needs is very important.\\nAs HACCP principles require, HACCP team members were decided. The tem\\nconsists of interdisciplinary experts from Buenos Aires University, Estancias de\\nPatagonia SA, manager plant, veterinary plant, a SENASA inspector (placed in the\\nindustry), and it is supported by SENASA (experts). The veterinary plant will\\nmanage the quality program, and will be responsible for keeping the HACCP\\nupdated and permanently reviewed.\\nThe team meets periodically and area supervisors are permanently called up to\\nwork on the HACCP plan with the purpose of making them aware of their essential\\nrole of managing personnel. The supervisors\\u2019 main responsibility is to make workers\\naware of manipulating high-risk food. Employees unaware of the importance of\\ncleanness, hygiene, and right manipulation cannot be blamed for jeopardizing food\\nsafety and consequently, consumers\\u2019 health. However, the person responsible for\\nleading the change is the manager who must show commitment through daily\\ndecision and behavior.\\nSo far, the motivation and awareness of all involved workers has been apparently\\npositive since the manager started making the recommended investments and\\nworking on the process hygienic basic problems. Meanwhile, the HACCP team had\\nmeetings with all technical areas in order to keep them motivated and committed.\\n3.1.3 Impact of the self- control system\\nDuring the process, the external context changed and the original requirements\\nincreased as a result of the European Union visit to Argentine meat industry.\\nFulfilling specifications requires deeper changes and more investment. In the last\\nmonths the activities were carried out according to the planned agenda; however,\\ndelays have already appeared as a result of delayed investment and workers\\nmanipulation changes.I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\n\\u201cPatagonia Sur\\u201d had all the expected obstacles related to insufficient basic hygiene,\\nlow personnel competence, financial scarcity, old infrastructure and facilities, and\\npoor communication. About the strategic alliance, the partners have been acting\\nwithout assuming their duties, which was neither helping nor supporting HACCP\\nimplementation. Still worse, the contractor did not comply with the minimal signed\\ncontract with both the government and the shareholders. The shareholders never\\nvisited the slaughterhouse until some problems showed up. At the beginning, the\\nveterinary Plant was working without empowerment and SENASA inspector was\\nneither controlling nor demanding minimal regulation requirements.\\nThose technical and financial limitations and partners\\u2019 behavior impacted in the\\nemployees\\u2019 commitment and motivation. Consequently, the HACCP success has\\nbeen jeopardized, and reviewing minimal requirements has been the main cause of\\nthe delayed agenda.\\nUnder those circumstances, there were also positive impacts. The first was to make\\nevident all the emerging problems both technologic and operative -based on\\ninfrastructure complications- making the partners aware of those limitations and\\ndriving them to make the necessary decisions on investing.\\nThe second HACCP positive impact was also to bring out the complexity of the\\nstrategic alliance. It forced the partners to review their own duty, demanding\\nshareholders, management and the local SENASA inspector to meet the terms of\\nthe original agreement. As long as those internal constraints are not faced and\\nsolved, the new model will fail, not being a genuine competitive advantage at all.\\n3.2. Green Beef Quality Protocol \\u2013 Self Certification Model\\nThe proposal \\u201cPampas del Salado\\u201d introduces a paradigmatic change aimed at the\\nconstruction of a new strategy in the business of cattle and beef in Argentina. This\\nis a unique \\u201cPilot Project\\u201d which defines a new model planned to go from calf region\\n\\u201cPampas del Salado\\u201d to the entire livestock of the \\\"Pampas Argentina.\\\" This is a\\nleading case involves more than 300 farmers from 11 municipalities, almost 200\\nthousand hectares and more than 65,000 animals, compared to the larger number of\\nArgentine livestock, nearing 50 million head.\\nThe institutional framework must protect property rights in order to allow the use\\nof the geographical area name as denomination of origin. Also, the law must provide\\na stable and secure platform in order to make the competitive advantages\\nsustainable in the long run. Organizational innovation consolidates the coordination\\nof collective action and strategic alliance based on the significant asset involved.\\nThe technological aspect is related to the three quality protocols formulated,\\nenabling different attributes of quality, origin and required traceability in order to\\nadd value to one of the most remarkable Argentine products.I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nThe main objective starts joining the collective action of cattle dealers around the\\norigin and quality protocols: green beef , grain beef  and eco-beef . This strategy\\naims at increasing negotiation ability in the cattle sector in order to influence the\\nbeef business. The idea is to collect local data creating local knowledge with global\\nimpact, and a farmers\\u2019 network managing information and knowledge through\\nCOPRODER, a regional group of municipalities, in order to become a self-certified\\nfarmers network.\\nThe network is built through registers that collect local data, such as information of\\norigin and quality of the cattle and beef. The registers convert this information in\\nvaluable knowledge to consumers in any market. That is the core of the added value\\nin information and knowledge for consumers. That is also the key to negotiation\\nstrengths in farmers\\u2019 hands.\\nAs this model is a collective strategy among farmers and processors, with the\\ncoordination and support of provincial and local governments, the first phase of the\\nproject has been financially supported by the government and assisted by experts of\\nthe Buenos Aires University during 2001 and 2002's first semester. The second\\nphase, the 2002 second semester, counted on financial support of local government\\nand the same technical assistance, although caravans purchase for individual\\nidentification was afforded by the farmers. By all means, the roles in this collective\\nstrategy have been functional and dynamic.  It also proves that, slowly but\\nprogressively, those roles are going toward the farmers since they are not only the\\nowners of the business but also the beneficiaries of the gains.\\n3.2.1. Introducing Green Beef Protocol: Phase of Application\\nAfter of almost three years of the project development, important advances have\\nbeen made. The farmers are in charge of handling the information through the\\nNetwork of local Registries. Although the Network is coordinated by Pampas del\\nSalado Regional Consortium and it is carried out through:\\n\\uffff  Collective action\\n\\uffff  Origin and traceability\\n\\uffff  The quality of cattle and beef: Good Cattle Practices\\nThat set is enclosed under the quality protocol \\u201cGreen Beef\\u201d. The university quality\\nmeat laboratory has been working on the standardization of the \\u201cgreen beef: grass\\nfeeding\\u201d protocol. The lab is carrying out the objective and measurable\\ndemonstration of both product and process\\u2019 quality and has developed a sampling\\nmethodology. Standardization is about selecting representative farms and identified\\nanimals, as well as finding out and objectively demonstrating the relationshipI. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\namong Argentine beef quality attributes with agro-environmental conditions and\\nhandling.\\nSo far, the Green Beef protocol governs 11 municipalities--COPRODER and British\\nand Continental breeds--according to quality standards and other issues regarding\\nperformance. These issues involve handling, animal health, weight and age of\\nslaughter, high standards and grades of carcasses (good cattle practices), animal\\nwelfare and others.\\nTraceability is now supported by the National Administration through regulations\\n(years 2002 and 2003) that have been passed as a consequence of European Union\\nrecommendations and that are very helpful to provide a safe environment for this\\nleading case.\\nTraceability starts with animal individual identification and gathering data such as\\nfarmers\\u2019 register number and animal date of birth. Nowadays, calves have been\\nidentified and registered, and are going to be certified taking the data out of local\\nand regional registries.\\nThe definitive Quality Protocol, \\u201cgreen beef,\\u201d has not been finished yet, due to the\\nfact that lab is still collecting and analyzing data and also because some issues are\\nstill under farmer discussion. Quality and traceability are going to be demonstrated\\nand audited using both the parameters/standards and the data objectively\\nmeasured and recorded on the field.\\nSo far, the farmers have settled individual identification, bought the caravans and\\nadjusted the quality protocol in order to certify, at least, calf origin and quality\\nattributes before selling and moving them to another farm.\\n3.2.2  Phase of Human Resources Structural Changes\\nA group of mayors from different municipalities agreed that cattle growing in\\nnatural conditions would be one of the main regional projects. Eleven mayors and\\nrural association members met in order to develop this proposal and in spite of the\\ndiscrepancy of interests. They agreed that this project was going to be the most\\nrealistic for the region.\\nThe facts show that the internal organizational aspect is difficult to accomplish and\\nis particularly difficult in this case, because of the involved actors: 300 farmers,\\nprovincial and 11 municipal governments, technicians from the university,\\nCOPRODER and the rural associations. These organizations make collective action\\nvery complex.I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nFarmers and processors were coordinated by rural associations, supported by\\nmunicipal and provincial governments, and technically assisted by professionals.\\nThey had many meetings before finding the most suitable organizations that meet a\\ncommon interest and make it possible to have collective actions. The decision\\nmaking goes bottom up -from farmers to representatives of local commissions and\\nthe regional consortium- in that order. Those meetings, conferences and workshops\\nwere the common place where all participants exchanged knowledge and expertise,\\nideas and opinions, in order to reach the fitting quality protocol and to develop an\\nappropriate traceability procedure.\\nDissemination among farmers was done in the middle of enormous difficulties such\\nas the most severe floods of the Province of Buenos Aires, the reappearance of foot\\nand mouth disease, the spectacular reduction of the real estate prices, and the\\npolitical and economic crisis of the years 2001 and 2002. That very unfavourable\\nsituation trigger farmer awareness of being the only ones responsible for adding\\nvalue to their products, building competitive advantages and improving their\\nnegotiation capability in the cattle business.\\nSo far, the group of cattle dealers are willing to appropriate the project, and they\\nare strongly convinced of their leadership in the continuity of the process. Besides,\\nfarmers are also aware that either success or failure is under their own\\nresponsibility. Now, they are in charge.\\n3.2.3. Impact of the self-certification model\\nRegarding the European Union and shortly others new countries traceability will be\\nrequired. It is a fact that the entire livestock in Argentina will be affected. The\\nnational government is strongly supporting the project, given that both the\\nAgricultural Secretariat and the National Inspection Service (SENASA) adopted\\nregulations making traceability mandatory for exports. This is a significant\\ninstitutional decision offering an adequate framework to the leading case, since new\\nand fair rules of the game will run the whole business. Furthermore, cattle dealers\\nof the Pampa del Salado are already organized and they can take advantage of this\\nto export.\\nOnce that first experience is consolidated, it is possible to move on to the next goal,\\ndeveloping the denominations-of-origin strategy in order to create competitive\\nadvantages for the entire Argentine beef business. The proposed pathway will be\\nextending from the calves of Pampa del Salado to the young bulls of the Pampa\\nArgentina.\\nTaking into account that many farmers are involved, many opposite interests\\ncoexists, and current businesses are being affected, this project is the most difficult\\nto achieve of the three projects analyzed. The change of paradigm is not onlyI. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nresponsibility of the farmers, it is the responsibility of politicians, technicians, and\\nthe rest of the actors involved of the beef chain.\\nThe collective strategy is very strong and very fragile at the same time. Reaching a\\nconsensus among farmers has been a very tough task, and it has not finished yet.\\nThis leading case is founded on institutional, organizational, and technological\\nchanges affecting the Argentine beef business, and not all of the involved actors are\\nwilling to take sides.\\nThis is also a very ambitious project that, sooner or later, will affect many\\nconsolidated interests and informal business. However, since many farmers are\\ninvolved, the opponents will be restrained to do so openly. Furthermore, this pilot\\nexperience involves almost 65,000 animals against a cattle business that involves\\nalmost 50 million head, meaning there is a long way to go.\\n3.3. Implementation Of Strategic Plan And ISO 9001 (VS 2000)\\nTerminal Quequen S.A. (TQ) is a private port located in Buenos Aires and its\\nagribusiness operations include reception, storage, quality homogenization,\\nblending and identity preservation (IP), and ship load services. Terminal Quequen\\nis implementing ISO 9001/2000 with the main purpose of transforming the \\u201chuman\\nresources\\u201d in \\u201csocial Capital\\u201d as competitive assets by means of ISO\\u2019s certification.\\nTQ was born as a private company ten years ago, after 20 years of being a\\ngovernment-run organization (National Grain Board). The private company was run\\nby a government manager until the last year when a grain business experienced\\nmanager took charge of the position. Plant value is estimated to be about $ 20\\nmillion US. Since the privatisation almost $12 million US were invested from\\ncompany profits.\\nThe company manages 160,000 tons, mainly in maize and wheat operations. The\\nloading activity is concentrated from December to March for wheat and from April\\nto May for maize and it manages almost 80 vessels of 20 thousand ton capacity each\\nand around 50 thousand trucks.\\nArgentina\\u2019s unfavourable economic situation (2001 and 2002) makes the company\\ninvest in human resources as an attractive alternative to add value and\\ncompetitiveness of very low cost rather than to investing in either technology or\\nother matters. Furthermore, since unemployment rose by 20%, and 50% of the\\nArgentine population lives in poverty; the management can not afford any\\nconfrontation with neither the labor union nor with the government.\\nInstead, the general manager chose to implement a new technological model in\\norder to make the needed paradigm change from inside. The challenge to theI. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nmanagement is to convert this \\u201cworkforce in human capital\\u201d which means\\nconverting it in dynamic and competitive assets. Additionally, this process allows\\nthorough inner research of the company technical and human resource problems.\\nThe management is very confident about the construction of competitive advantages\\nthrough the strategic plan and ISO certification. Hence, this would put the company\\nin a better position compared to their domestic and international competitors, being\\nQuality Management ISO standard a remarkable marketing tool, at least in this\\nbusiness. Certainly, the general manager\\u2019s conviction is that the company has an\\ninnovating profile since new ideas and proposals are evaluated constantly.\\n3.3.1. Introducing ISO 9001 (vs. 2000): Phase of Application\\nThe evaluation reported prescriptive recommendations evidencing the differences\\ndetected between the real operation of the organization and the demanded\\noperation in the ISO 9001 requirements. The diagnostic evaluation essentially\\naimed at evaluating the approach used in the definition of methodologies for\\ndifferent processes, remaining for a later step a stricter evaluation of the\\nimplantation degree and effectiveness.\\nThe management gets involved with the development, implementation,\\nmaintenance and continuous improvement of the Quality System. The involvement\\nis demonstrated through the following aspects: assuring that all workers of\\nTerminal Quequ\\u00e9n S.A. understand that the company\\u2019s high-priorities are there for\\nthe satisfaction of:\\n\\uffff  Client requirements,\\n\\uffff  Internal rules requirements,\\n\\uffff  Expectations of the shareholders, and\\n\\uffff  Maintenance of an appropriate worksite environment.\\nAll the processes of Terminal Quequ\\u00e9n S.A. were made to fit in the previous\\nrequests. The management issues and spreads Quality Policy like an explicit\\ncommitment to the values mentioned, and assures the objective is aligned with the\\nPolicy of effective Quality.\\nTerminal Quequ\\u00e9n S.A. defines the Client\\u2019s approach as an essential strategy for\\noperation development. This strategy is sustained and implemented through: a)\\nknowledge of the clients\\u2019 different expectations, b) the systematic translation of\\nthose expectations to requirements, considering operative availability and\\neconomical feasibility, c) the commitment to offer the service fulfilling the\\nrequirements, through parameters within the chain of clients - internal suppliers,\\nd) satisfaction evaluation of the diverse clients, and e) implementation, control and\\nimprovement of the Quality system .I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nThe Operative Procedure is like any cereal and grain stocking and loading company\\nthat operates blending different standards to increase product quality \\u2013\\nhomogenisation-. It also handles Identity Preservation (IP) with identification of the\\nraw materials and products \\u2013from the farm to the vessel-. There is an electronic\\ndata program to trace all operations from truck\\u2019s reception to vessel unloading.\\nThe Administrative Procedure has insufficient software although it has planned to\\ndevelop a program for the works ordered, for cost\\u2019s center, and for storeroom stock.\\nThere is a supplier database and critical suppliers are chosen both by quality and\\nprice criteria.\\nThe Preventive and Corrective Maintenance Procedure is being developed. In fact,\\npredictive and preventive controls are a very large issue related to people safety\\nsince the plant is fifty years old. The old silos do not have temperature and\\nhumidity controls, just the new ones do. Periodic data and statistics are being\\norganized. The company uses calibration patterns and has written a procedure of\\ncritical control equipment and instrument calibration.\\nOnce the previous phase is complete and part of the problems aforementioned\\nsolved; the pre certification and certification will be carried out. The Pre-\\ncertification audit it is recommendable, although non-mandatory.\\n3.3.2. Phase of Human Resources Structural Changes\\nThe Quality Policy assures the provision of both human and material resources for\\nthe appropriate development of the Quality System. Commitment to Quality is well-\\ndefined, also, through the effective leadership of the manager and its closest team.\\nThis leadership is based on unrestricted respect of said Quality Values - the\\nbackbone of operative management.\\nThe company has 102 employees; most of them are from the public sector. In the\\nopinion of private organizations, Argentine workers coming from the public sector\\nhave a culture for working inefficiently. This implies extensive conflict focused on\\nthe coexistence of two very different work site cultures, which makes the operation\\nheavy and slow.\\nThe modified flow chart has been a very helpful tool in reducing obstacles since it\\nhas included a definition of required position competence, personnel profiles, and\\ntraining needs; and thus, responsibilities and functions remain clearly defined.\\nBesides, it makes it possible to detect and eliminate both unnecessary and\\nbureaucratic tasks through the writing of procedures for specific jobs.I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nThe human resources structural change started with initial training focused on ISO\\nintroduction as a tool to bring all employees on line. Oriented and motivational\\nworkshops were arranged to make workers identify their process inefficiencies and\\nto look for potential solutions. As a first experience, all workers were listened to and\\nall opinions were openly discussed, counting on the fact that workers know the\\ntasks they are supposed to perform and the possible solutions to problems as well\\nas.\\nThe following step was internal auditor selection and training, and preparation for\\nthe first internal audit. Part of the management and some employees were willing\\nto be quality system internal auditors, which means self-evaluation and evaluation\\nof other processes.\\n3.3.3. Quality Assurance Impacts\\nWhile the ISO 9001 (vs. 2000) requirements have been almost accomplished, the\\nhuman resource structural change has not happened yet. Certainly, ISO 9001 is a\\nvery useful tool but it must be used progressively. In fact, it can be discouraging to\\ndiscuss employees\\u2019 overt conflicts and dissatisfaction, as management is not\\nstrongly convinced. Moreover, uncertainties and doubts are expected during the\\nimplantation process, knowing that these changes are to break old paradigms.\\nConsequently, commitment and motivation drop and go up alternatively. Things do\\nnot occur overnight and this does not mean either failure or success, not until the\\nprocess is done and has proved it may be maintained.\\nFrom the very beginning, a certain opposition and other obstacles were detected and\\nunfortunately this was happened among managers, those closest to the general\\nmanager.  That restriction comes from management\\u2019s peculiar idea of not sharing\\nknowledge and concealing information, as this means \\u201ckeeping power\\u201d. Still, the\\nproblem is being openly discussed, although as of yet it has not been solved.\\nLikewise, the company has done some benchmarking and research on problems,\\nbenefits, and competitive advantages. It has concluded that despite all the\\ndifficulties it has faced, the process is being improved, sorted out and systematized,\\npeople are getting organised and their profiles are known and fitted according to\\nindividual competence. A new annual training plan -training and performance\\nevaluation- as well as all tools as may be useful for the company efficiency and\\nefficacy, have been settled.\\nIn summary, all those internal movements, changes and worries are avenues\\nleading to Quality Assurance and the satisfaction of shareholders, employees,\\nmanagement and clients.I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\n4. Results & Conclusions\\nSociety at large and, above all, the agribusinesses were affected as a result of\\nArgentina\\u2019s economic and political collapse. Agribusiness executives were forced to\\nlook for new alternatives in the international market since the domestic market was\\noffering neither the possibility to increase incomes nor a certain environment. On\\nthe other hand, international competitor level showed that in order to be\\ncompetitive it was necessary to add value for the creation of competitive\\nadvantages. Technological innovation such as food safety and quality assurance\\nseemed to be the right strategy, as key drivers for competitiveness. As a result, the\\nlocal agribusiness is going through external constraints -due to institutional,\\norganizational and technological limitations- all the way to internal restrictions\\ncaused by cultural, technological and financial insufficiency.\\nBeing competitive not only entails facing the organizational and technological\\nunbalances, compared to international competitors, but also requires a safe\\ninstitutional platform. An unstable institutional scenario with unclear and\\nchanging rules of the game and informal contracts is not a healthy framework for\\nany innovative design, permanently threatening any effort and achievement.\\nOrganizations fail to provide the necessary framework for the development of new\\ndesigns, forcing transactions to operate in an informal economy .  Then, real\\ninnovation requires a transparent business culture and dependence on an\\ninstitutional and organisational frame to provide a formal structure .\\nThe leading cases described show that building competitiveness is to be\\naccomplished from the process of technological approach, taking into account that\\nFood Safety is a road to Quality Assurance and both are keys to building\\ncompetitive advantages.\\nIn the internal context, the situation is no less complex since partnerships in the\\nthree cases mean collective action based on a common vision and values. The\\ndelayed implementation of the proposals is also a consequence of internal\\norganization issues based on the required cultural change. Cultural change may\\ntake years but, despite the delays, it is expected that these leading cases will\\nsucceed in the long run.\\nLimitations and restraints are part of the analysis as they emerge from the complex\\neconomic scenario and from the precarious strategic alliances in which those\\nagribusinesses are inserted. Poor interrelationships among share holders,\\nambiguous rules of the game and low commitment have been the emerging facts of\\nthat collective action . In this context, it was pretty obvious that different levels of\\nimplementation and different impacts on human resources\\u2019 expected change were to\\nbe found.I. Jatib / The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review Vol 6 Iss 1 2003\\nParticularly, in the HACCP model, the external context changed due to the\\nenhancement of the original requirements as a result of European Union more\\ndemanding standards. The HACCP positive impact was that it brought out the\\ncomplexity and uncertainty of the collective strategy and that it made both\\nshareholders and management and SENASA\\u2019s inspector review their lack of\\nresponsibilities and low commitment.  The HACCP system also made evident all the\\nfailures -both technological and operative- in the process. Consequently, all partners\\nare now trying to work out those obstacles.\\nThe impact of the self-certification model of \\u201cPampa del Salado\\u201d confirmed and\\nmade publicly evident that there are contrasting interests at stake, above all, in the\\nmany current informal cattle and beef businesses.  As this is an ambitious project,\\nrepresenting 0.13 % of the total Argentine cattle business, the proposal of extending\\nthe calves of Pampa del Salado to the entire Argentine beef business, will take more\\ntime and more farmer involvement. However, the pilot project could help to\\nintroduce institutional, organizational, and technological changes in the Argentine\\nbeef business. The change of paradigm is not only the farmers\\u2019 and processors\\u2019 duty\\nbut also the duty of politicians, technicians, and of the other stakeholders involved.\\nInternally, the partners to this collective action will have to keep working on the\\nissues that have already come forward and focus on reinforcing their commitment.\\nIn spite of ISO 9001 implantation being almost accomplished, the human resource\\nstructural change has not yet been reached. It is expected that operative\\nmanagement opposition will dwindle as a consequence of both the natural\\nimplantation process and a strong leadership. At the same time, the rest of the\\nworkers are making the service more efficient and doing the necessary efforts to\\nachieve client satisfaction. After all of the tackled difficulties, the process is\\nbecoming more efficient and effective and the satisfaction of shareholder, employee,\\nmanagement and client expectations that is Quality Assurance -which is one of the\\ncompany\\u2019s concerns- is on its way.\\nAlthough the leading cases are undergoing institutional and organizational\\nscenarios of external instability and are internally precarious, their essential\\nstrength is having a clear goal and well defined objectives. The certainty of going\\nstep by step allows both moving forward and expectation of success, all the\\nwarnings having been given. By next June 2003, there will be new developments in\\nsome of the innovation models discussed.  The outcomes thereof will be further\\ndiscussed at that time.I.

From 2005 to 2007 the JRC-IPTS carried out two projects on food quality assurance \\nschemes in the EU-251. In 2008 and 2009, the JRC-IPTS cooperated with Akdeniz University \\n(UNIAKD) to analyse food quality assurance schemes in Turkey.  \\n \\nIn the study the governance structure of food quality assurance in Turkey is explained, which \\nincludes public, semi-public and private institutes, laws and legislations, policies and \\nresearch. There are five public and one semi-public institution with relevance to food quality \\nand safety in Turkey (the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (TKB), the Turkish \\nStandards Institution (TSE), the Turkish Patent Institute (TPE), the Under-Secretary for \\nForeign Trade (DTM), the Under-Secretary of the State Planning Organisation (DPT), and the \\nTurkish Accreditation Agency (T\\u00dcRKAK)).  \\n \\nA workshop with the participation of key stakeholders was organised in order to carry out a \\nSWOT analysis of the food quality assurance in Turkey. The Logical Framework Matrix \\n(LFM) incorporated the opinions, ideas and contributions of stakeholders. Producer \\norganisations, food processing industry associations and cooperatives in the food sector were \\ninvited to the workshop in Ankara for a broad contribution. The project team moderated the \\nLFM discussion based on the preliminary LFM derived from the SWOT analysis conducted in \\nprevious workshops. Afterwards, a Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) study was conducted by \\ninterviewing local stakeholders and farmers from 12 villages who produce major commodities \\nin terms of the production volume, export value or special characteristics.  \\n \\nA lack of quality awareness of consumers and producers is determined as the main problem \\nfrom the SWOT and LFM studies. Producers' knowledge is limited and their quality \\nperception focuses mainly on food safety. Furthermore disorganised small scale producers are \\nunable to solve quality issues by themselves. Coordination and collaboration among actors in \\nthe food chain are weak in terms of developing and ensuring food quality. Incentives for food \\nquality through complementary procedures or financial support are limited. Therefore it is \\ndifficult for small producers and enterprises to improve product quality, which might result in \\nexclusion from dynamic food markets. Through the RRA studies on the participation of \\nsmall-scale producers in organic farming it was also observed that they voiced limited interest \\nin the subject. Key stakeholders are not sufficiently organised to obtain Geographical \\nIdentification (GI) certification for the important food products in their region. \\n \\nThere are barriers in exports due to insufficient quality, reducing the Turkish share in world \\nfood markets. However, the infrastructure regarding food safety issues, such as minimum \\nlegal requirements, requested by importing country authorities and/or multinational food retail \\nchains, has generally been improved in Turkey. For example, observations show that there are \\ngreat quality improvements in milk production; milk quality now exceeds the minimum Food \\nCodex requirements. The main driver for this improvement is the existence of large scale \\nnational and international dairy companies pushing forward quality standards in the market.  \\n \\n                                                 \\n1 Visit http://foodqualityschemes.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/index.html for more information.  \\n 4\\nThe conclusions of the project lead, among others, to the following recommendations. \\nConsumer and producer quality awareness must be improved to effectively overcome food \\nquality assurance scheme problems in Turkey. Therefore, cooperation between different \\ngovernment institutions, and also media, is required to inform the wider public about food \\nquality. Investment in infrastructure is required of public institutions to further develop the \\nnecessary conditions for the production of safe and quality foods. Marketing campaigns \\nabroad could promote GIs and organic agriculture in Turkey. The EU accession process is \\nsupportive of the development of food quality in Turkey and its continuation will be an \\nimportant driver in the coming years, as will be support from the EU and other international \\norganisations, e.g. the World Bank. Future research may focus on supply chain analysis and \\nobstacles to collaboration between key actors, consumer response to quality in domestic \\nmarkets, and on a model to prevent small scale producers being excluded from dynamic \\nmarkets.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAuthors: \\nAhmet Ali Ko\\u00e7, Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Administrative \\nSciences, Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey \\nSerhat Asci, Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences, \\nAkdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey \\nHami Alpas, Department of Food Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, \\nTurkey \\nFatma Handan Giray, Department of Agricultural Economics, Faculty of Agriculture, \\nSuleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey (formerly JRC-IPTS) \\nStephan Hubertus Gay, European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Institute for \\nProspective Technological Studies (IPTS), Seville, Spain \\n \\n 5\\nTable of Contents \\nExecutive Summary ................................................................................................................... 3 \\nTable of Contents ....................................................................................................................... 5 \\nList of tables ............................................................................................................................... 6 \\nList of figures ............................................................................................................................. 6 \\n1.

Introduction \\nThe Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS), one of the seven research \\ninstitutes of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC), has \\nconducted research on food quality assurance under the idea of enhancing value added to farm \\nproducts. The research was initiated in 2005 by the European Parliament and DG Agriculture \\nand Rural Development asked the JRC-IPTS to carry out a project on 'food quality assurance \\nand certification schemes managed within an integrated supply-chain in the EU-25'. The \\nresearch aimed to (i) identify the driving factors of the EU food industry development and \\ntheir impact on production and trade, and (ii) analyse the advisability of a community legal \\nframework for protection of food quality and certification schemes. The work was structured \\ninto two major steps: (a) stakeholders consultation process, which included a series of \\nworkshops in selected MS, stakeholders' hearing in May 2006 and the final stakeholders' \\nconference in February 2007 to ensure that the analysis was based not only on the best \\nexisting knowledge in the field, but also on the experience and knowledge of the different \\nstakeholders; (b) research studies on food supply chains (dynamics, quality certification, \\nreview of existing studies and methodologies, food quality assurance scheme inventory and \\nthe economic analysis of nine case studies included)2. \\n \\nFollowing the above studies, the JRC-IPTS decided to expand this research on food quality \\nissues to Candidate Countries. The JRC-IPTS has cooperated with Akdeniz University \\n(UNIAKD) to expand the project. The food quality assurance schemes project in Turkey \\nstarted in July 2008 and lasted for a period of seven months.  \\n \\nThis study initially elaborates the governance structure of food quality assurance in Turkey \\nwhich includes public, semi-public and private institutes, laws and legislations in a broad \\nbased perspective, and policies and research on food quality issues. Thereafter, a workshop \\nwas organised with the participation of key stakeholders in order to carry out a SWOT \\nanalysis of the food quality assurance in Turkey. The third activity was focused on building a \\nLogical Framework Matrix (LFM), with stakeholders from the food and feed industry and \\npublic institutions, based on information gathered from the previous three activities and \\ncontributions made by stakeholders. Following these activities, a Rapid Rural Appraisal \\n(RRA) study was conducted by interviewing local stakeholders and farmers in villages \\nlocated at 12 different locations and on nine major commodities in terms of the production \\nvolume, export value or special characteristics. This report provides final conclusions and \\nspecific recommendations.  \\n \\n                                                 \\n2 Visit http://foodqualityschemes.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/index.html for more information.  \\n 8\\n2. Review of the current setting regarding food quality in \\nTurkey \\nFood quality corresponds to food characteristics including external factors (texture, flavour, \\norigin and appearance; size, shape, colour) and internal factors (chemical, physical, microbial) \\n(Grunert, 2002). Food quality also deals with the traceability of raw materials, ingredients and \\npackaging as suppliers and consumers may be susceptible to any form of contamination, and \\nconsumers and retailers also need to trust manufacturing and processing standards. In \\naddition, food quality also deals with labelling issues to ensure the correct use of products, \\ningredients and provide the correct nutritional information.  \\n \\nAgriculture still plays an important role in Turkey\\u2019s economy, even though its share in the \\neconomy has decreased significantly during the last few decades. The agricultural sector made \\nup about 22 % of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) at the beginning of the 1980s, but that has \\ndeclined to around 10 % in recent years. The annual growth rate of the Turkish agricultural \\nsector was 3.4 % in 2009 and 0.08 % in the first half of 2010 (DPT, 2010). Agriculture is still \\nan important buffer against urban unemployment. Total unemployment account for 14 % in \\n2009 and 10.4 % in July 2010, for non-agricultural activities these figures are 17.4 % and \\n13.6 %, respectively. However, nearly 30 % of the economically active population lives in \\nrural areas (DPT, 2009), while agricultural employment accounted for 24.6 % of employment \\nin 2009 and 26.8 % in August 2010, according to the participation in the workforce (DPT, \\n2010). Agriculture, fishery and food products-beverages made up around 8.4 % of the total \\nexport value of 107.2 billion US$ in 2007 (DPT, 2008). \\n \\nThe size of the Turkish food sector is estimated to be 45 billion Euros globally. The food \\nprocessing sector represents a 20 % share in total production of the manufacturing sector and \\ncontributes approximately 5 % to the Gross National Product (Guittard, 2006). According to \\nthe Industry Census of TU\\u0130K in 2002, there are 30 649 enterprises and 247 769 employees in \\nthe food processing sector (DPT, 2007). Most of them are small to medium-size enterprises. It \\nwas also mentioned in the food industry expert committee report that around 10-12 % of the \\nfood processing enterprises are relatively modern and of a large size. Only a small proportion \\nof food processing enterprises firms meet the EU quality norms-standards (Oskam et al, \\n2004). These figures have been improved rapidly during the last few years at the request of \\nmultinational food retail chains and export markets. \\n \\nTurkey has also been a contractor in a series of international agreements related to fair trade \\nrules since 1994. Therefore, some commitments have to be undertaken such as establishing \\nspecial courts to create powerful industrial property rights throughout the country, and \\ntraining and presentation functions must be performed to raise public awareness. For instance, \\nthe 'WTO agreement' and its annex IC 'Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual \\nProperty Rights' and the customs union with the EU were constrained by liability regarding \\npatents, trademarks, industrial design and geographical indications3 (GIs). \\n \\nPolicies dealing with food safety and quality started to develop in the mid-1990s, due to the \\ncustoms union agreement with the EU in 1995, and strengthened during the 2000s because of \\nexports to developed market economies and greater concern over food safety and quality. The \\npenetration of supermarkets into domestic retail markets is another driving force behind food \\nquality and safety (Oskam et al, 2004): simulations of the long-term impact of EU accession \\n                                                 \\n3 GIs cover both PDO and PGI according to the Turkish legislation, similar to the EU quality system. \\n 9\\nsuggest that the increased market access to the EU could generate a significant increase in \\ndemand, in both quantity and quality, that would support significant growth of the agricultural \\nand food sectors in Turkey (World Bank, 2006). Turkey has formally adopted a number of \\ntypical elements of food safety regulations and control systems in the accession period to the \\nEU. There are developments which signal some of the more formal approaches to deal with \\nfood safety and a few available empirical analyses of food safety applications in Turkey, but it \\nis difficult to discuss food quality issues as there is no accessible comprehensive study and the \\ndefinition of quality is even more difficult. \\n \\nThis chapter provides information and describes the current situation of food quality \\nassurance schemes in Turkey. It contains a literature review, projects implemented to improve \\ninfrastructure of food quality assurance schemes, information about main public, semi-public \\nand private organisations, legislations related to food safety and quality, policies supporting \\nfood safety and quality, and information about the current situation of food quality assurance \\nindicators.   \\n \\n2.1. Organisations responsible for the food quality \\ninfrastructure \\nThere are five public institutions and one semi-public one with relevance on food quality and \\nsafety in Turkey. Enforcement of the responsibility of food safety was divided between the \\nMinistry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (TKB) with Decree-Law \\n560 in 1995 and, later, unified at the TKB in 2004 with Food Law No. 5179. Both ministries \\nprepared the framework 'Decree-Law 560' and the Turkish Food Codex together. Until Food \\nLaw 5179/2004, the Ministry of Health and TKB were the two major government \\ndepartments responsible for food safety controls at selling and serving points (the Ministry of \\nHealth) and for the production units (TKB). Both were also responsible for registering and \\ngiving permission to food producing firms, as well as for onsite inspections of food producing \\nplants and food selling points before the 'Food Law No. 5179'. With this new food law, TKB \\nbecame the competent authority for inspecting all food stages from production to \\nconsumption and took over all responsibility for food safety inspections. Inspection and \\nanalysis of drinking water quality and safety remains the responsibility of the Ministry of \\nHealth. However, considering that the EU accession period is one of the most important \\ndrivers of food safety and quality issues, after EU criticism of 'Food Law No. 5179' regarding \\nthe national food codex commission, risk analysis, scientific committees, national food \\nassembly, feedback system, temporally injunction, emergency cases, crises management, \\ntraceability and market monitoring (Giray et al.), a new draft was prepared and submitted to \\nthe parliament in 2009. The 'Veterinarian Services, Crop Health, Food and Feed Law No. \\n5996' (Official Gazette, 13.06.2010; No. 27610) has been approved and enforced since June \\n2010.  \\n \\nThe Under-Secretary for Foreign Trade (DTM) and General Directorate for Standardisation \\nfor Foreign Trade has inspection units at selected points for the issuance of the 'Inspection \\nCertificate(s)' for agricultural products to be exported/imported within the scope of the \\nstandards mandated in exports/imports.  \\n \\nThe Under-Secretary of State Planning Organisation (DPT) is the main decision-making body \\nand is responsible for preparing the Development Plans and Annual Programmes of the \\nGovernment including food safety and quality policies and investment decisions for \\nimproving the quality assurance infrastructure of TKB.  \\n 10\\n \\nThe TSE (Turkish Standards Institution) previously had a very important role in food quality, \\nsince they prepared the respective mandated Turkish standards, conducted conformity \\nassessment tests and issued certificates for the respective food products. But with the new \\nlegislation, their official role is reduced to issuing only Conformity Certificates to food \\nimporters and to conducting auditing activities for the quality assurance systems (ISO 9000s, \\n22000 and so on) established by food producing plants. This latter function is also being \\npracticed by private European firms with regional offices in Turkey (i.e. Bureau Veritas, \\nT\\u00dcV).  \\n \\nMoreover, the Turkish Patent Institute (TPE) acts as a certification and auditing body for \\ntrademarks and GIs. TPE has been established, as an independent legal entity with a special \\nbudget being attached to the Ministry of Industry and Trade with the objective to support \\ntechnological development in Turkey and to protect industrial property rights, as well as to \\nprovide the public with information on industrial property rights, thereby supporting the \\ncultivation of a competitive environment and the development of research and development \\nactivities (www.tpe.gov.tr). \\n \\nIn addition, the Turkish Accreditation Agency (T\\u00dcRKAK) is a semi-public accreditation \\nbody supplying accessibility of standards and quality audits worldwide. T\\u00dcRKAK has been \\nestablished subject to private law provisions, but is linked to the Prime Ministry. T\\u00dcRKAK \\naccredits local and international bodies rendering laboratory, certification and inspection \\nservices, ensures the operation in accordance with established national and international \\nstandards, and thereby facilitates international recognition of product/service, system, \\npersonnel and laboratory certificates (www.turkak.org.tr). \\n 11\\nTable 1: Role of the main institutions in Turkish food quality assurance  \\nInstitution Main related laws  Issue date \\nand number \\nRole in food quality Harmonisation status \\nwith EU legislation \\nStatus \\nMinistry of \\nAgriculture and \\nRural Affairs (TKB) \\n \\nVeterinarian \\nServices, Crop \\nHealth, Food and \\nFeed Law N. 5996 \\n \\nFood Law No.5179 \\n \\n \\nOrganic Farm Law  \\nNo. 5256 \\n \\nITU (GAP) \\nRegulation \\n13.06.2010 \\nNo. 27610 \\n \\n \\n \\n05.06.2004,  \\nNo. 25483 \\n \\n01.12.2004 \\n \\n \\n08.09.2004 \\nNo. 25577 \\nMainly responsible for \\nfood safety, animal \\nwelfare and agricultural \\nproduction. \\n- Food Law does not \\ninclude feed and \\nveterinary concepts. \\n- Not harmonised with \\nthe latest law released \\nin the EU. \\n- idem for requirements \\nof GlobalGAP. \\nPublic \\nTurkish Standards \\nInstitution (TSE) \\nLaw No.132  \\n(establishment) \\n18.11.1960 Responsible for the \\npreparation of Turkish \\nfood standards. \\n \\n- Harmonise some food \\nproduct standards with \\nCodex. \\nPublic \\nTurkish Patent \\nInstitute (TPE) \\nGIs Law No.555 27.06.1995 \\nNo.22326 \\nTrademarks and GIs \\nCertification institute. \\n- There is yet no TSG \\nconcept. \\nPublic \\nUnder-Secretary for \\nForeign Trade \\n(DTM) \\nForeign Trade \\nTechnical Inspection \\nLaw No.4703 \\n \\nCommuniqu\\u00e9 about \\nTurquality support  \\n \\n11.07.2001 \\nNo. 24459 \\n \\n \\n \\n24.05.2006 \\nNo. 26177 \\nResponsible for the \\ninspection of product \\nstandards in foreign \\ntrade. \\n \\nRegulating incentives \\nfor the quality of \\nexported products. \\n Public \\nUnder-Secretary of \\nState Planning \\nOrganisation (DPT) \\nLaw No.4004  \\n(reorganisation) \\n16.06.1994 Responsible for the \\npreparation of \\nDevelopment Plans and \\nAnnual Programmes of \\nthe Government, \\nincluding investment \\nfor improving food \\nsafety and quality \\ninfrastructure. \\n Public \\nTurkish \\nAccreditation \\nAgency (T\\u00dcRKAK) \\nLaw No.4457 \\n(establishment) \\n27.10.1999 Responsible for \\naccessibility of \\nstandards and quality \\naudits worldwide. \\n Auto-\\nnomous \\nMinistry of Health* Law No.1593 24.04.1930 Responsible for \\ninspection, safety and \\nquality of drinking and \\nusage water. \\n Public \\nMunicipalities* Law No. 5216 Law \\nNo. 5393 Law No. \\n5302 \\n10.07.2004 \\n03.07.2005 \\n22.02.2005 \\nResponsible for food \\nsafety inspections at \\nfood selling points and \\nthe food service sector. \\n Public \\nMinistry of Industry \\nand Commerce*  \\nLaw on SMEs \\nDevelopment and \\nSupport \\n12.04.1990 \\nNo. 3624 \\nResponsible for SMEs \\norganisation and \\nsupporting their \\nrequirements. \\n Public \\n* No direct responsibility to ensure food quality. \\n \\n2.1.1. Public institutions  \\nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (TKB) \\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (TKB) has two essential sections which are the \\nmain service units and advisory and control units. The main service units of TKB are the \\nGeneral Directorate of Agricultural Production and Development, the General Directorate of \\nPlant Protection and Control, the General Directorate of Structuring and Support, and the \\n 12\\nGeneral Directorate for Agricultural Research and Department of Foreign Affairs and EU-\\nCoordination. TKB conducts research, and prepares plans and programmes on the \\nimprovement of agricultural production, and conservation of natural resources such as land, \\nwater, plants and animals. In addition, support of animal breeding, control of food and feed \\nproduction and usage of plant and animal drugs, supervision of services related to food and \\nfeed, control of animal diseases, provision of agricultural services and infrastructure, and \\nrehabilitation of social services related to agriculture are also under the mandate of TKB4.  \\n \\nIn Turkey, TKB is the main responsible institution for food safety. According to Food Law \\nNo. 5179, TKB is mainly concerned with the technical and hygienic aspects in food \\nproduction sites and focuses on the issuing of production licences for food producers and the \\ncontrol of selling and consumption points. TKB also issues control certificates for imports and \\nexports of foodstuffs. In addition, TKB is the contact point of the Codex Committee in Turkey \\nand related product communiqu\\u00e9s. \\n \\nThe food inspection system of TKB is composed of 40 laboratories within 81 provincial \\ndirectorates and over 5 000 food inspectors are carrying out food inspections (Ko\\u00e7, 2007). \\n \\nTKB is also responsible for the general management of the organic fruit and vegetable \\ncultivation system and Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) in Turkey. The Secretariat of \\nOrganic Agriculture and the Organic Agriculture Committee were established in 1993 under \\nthe Department of Research, Planning and Coordination, which is classified as one of the \\nadvisory and control units. Through the restructuring of TKB due to harmonisation of \\ninstitutions for EU accession, the responsibility was taken from the Department of Research, \\nPlanning and Coordination and given to the General Directorate of Agricultural Production \\nand Development in 2003 and a GAP5 (ITU) section was also established in the same unit. \\nCurrently staff dealing with issues on organic agriculture and GAP is employed in the \\nAlternative Agricultural Production Techniques Department. \\n \\n                                                 \\n4 www.tarim.gov.tr; access date: 15.08.2008. \\n5 ITU refers to Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) in Turkish and the ITU standards are regulated by Turkish \\nlegislation. \\n 13\\n \\n \\nFigure 1: Organic agriculture and ITU (GAP) organisation chart in TKB \\n \\nTurkish Standards Institution (TSE) \\nThe Turkish Standards Institution (TSE) was established by Law No. 132 on 18.11.1960 for \\nthe purpose of preparing standards for every kind of item and product together with their \\nprocedure and service. Turkey has been a member of ISO (International Organisation for \\nStandardisation) since 1955. TSE is publically funded, works according to the special rules of \\nlaw and has a juristic personality. Furthermore, authorities have entrusted TSE with \\nrepresenting Turkey within the regional and international organisations dealing with \\nstandardisation. TSE is very active at national level but also at international level (ISO and \\nIEC).  \\n \\nTSE is in charge of preparing standards for every item and product including their production \\nprocedure. The standards set by TSE are known as 'Turkish standards'. These standards are \\nvoluntary and can be made compulsory by the approval of the concerned ministry. It is \\nessential that any standard is a Turkish standard before it can be made compulsory. The \\nstandards made compulsory are published in the Official Gazette. In 2002 there were 18 129 \\nTurkish standards catalogued in TSE and over 20 000 in 2005.  \\n \\n 14\\nIf a firm desires to be accredited by ISO 9000 or ISO 22000, Turkish standards for products \\npublished by TSE have to be applied, and this should be audited by private auditors from \\ncertification firms. There are almost 1750 standards prepared by TSE related to food quality \\nand sanitary aspects. All the standards will be harmonised with EU standards and almost 600 \\nstandards have been repealed by new standards since the 1990s. However, there is no \\nmandatory domestic market inspection by TSE, although TSE contains certification auditors \\nfor products, production, services, laboratories and vehicles (www.tse.gov.tr). Furthermore, \\nall goods imported and exported must be compatible with TSE standards and this is inspected \\nby Under-Secretary for Foreign Trade (DTM) \\n \\nTurkish Patent Institute (TPE) \\nThe Turkish Patent Institute was established on June 19, 1994, based on the power granted by \\nLaw No. 4004 dated 16.06.1994, as an independent legal entity with a special budget acting \\nunder the authority of the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  \\n \\nLegislations were created as a reform feature to undertake liability on patenting, trademarks, \\nindustrial design and GIs, derived from the WTO agreement and its annex the 'Agreement on \\nTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights' (TRIPS) and the customs union with \\nthe EU. Therefore, special courts were established to create powerful industrial property \\nrights throughout the country and important achievements have been made through education \\nand presentations to inform public-oriented users of the system. \\n \\nUnder-Secretary for Foreign Trade (DTM) \\nThe Under-Secretary for Foreign Trade prepared the 'Ministerial Decree on the Regime of \\nTechnical Regulations and Standardisation in Foreign Trade' and its supplementary legislation \\nfor transparency in its implementation, gathering all regulations regarding standardisation \\npolicies in Turkey and establishing a legal base for the harmonisation of Turkish legislation \\nwith EU legislation6 . \\n \\nThe 'Decree on the Regime of Technical Regulations and Standardisation in Foreign Trade' is \\nin conformity with the requirements laid down in the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) \\n'Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade'. It prohibits discrimination among trading partners \\nand aims to ensure that imported products comply with the requirements of human health and \\nsafety, animal welfare or plant life, or the environment.  \\n \\nThe Foreign Trade Technical Inspection Law No. 4703 is related to the controls of \\nagricultural products to be exported within the scope of the standards mandated in exports. It \\nalso determines the framework of import controls, which are regulated by communiqu\\u00e9s in \\nmore detail. The aim of this application, dating back to the 1930s in Turkey, is to protect the \\nprestige of traditional Turkish agricultural products and create stable markets in foreign \\ncountries. \\n \\nThe standards, mandatory in exports, are TSE standards as mentioned before. These standards \\nare parallel to the UN/ECE standards and inspections are performed according to the OECD \\nscheme. Following the inspection carried out by the inspectors of DTM, a control certificate is \\ngiven to the exporter if the product is found to be in conformity with the relevant standard. \\nThe exporter cannot export the product without a control certificate. \\n \\n                                                 \\n6 www.dtm.gov.tr, access date: 16.08.2008 \\n 15\\nProducts will be exempted from inspection if the exporter possesses the 'Certificate of \\nCompetence on Commercial Quality Inspection'. This certificate is issued by the DTM for \\nproducers who are found to be competent in carrying out inspections by themselves. These \\nproducers are subject to periodic and random controls by the inspectorates. \\n \\nUnder-Secretary of the State Planning Organisation (DPT) \\nThe Under-Secretary of the State Planning Organisation (DPT) is affiliated to the Prime \\nMinister. The main duties of DPT are listed as follows: (a) advise the government in \\ndetermining economic, social and cultural policies and targets for the country by taking into \\naccount every type of natural, human and economic resources and possibilities of the country; \\n(b) prepare long-term development plans and annual programmes in accordance with the \\ntargets determined by the government; (c) coordinate activities of the ministries and public \\ninstitutions concerning economic, social and cultural policies, ensure efficient implementation \\nand advise the government regarding policy issues; (d) develop future-oriented strategies by \\nworking closely with international institutions, help reduce uncertainties in the medium and \\nlong-term for the private sector by making policy recommendations in cooperation with the \\nprivate sector.  \\n \\nDPT is responsible for the preparation of the annual investment programme and allocation of \\nthe national investment budget to the food control projects mentioned in the report. DPT is \\nalso responsible for the preparation of development plans and annual programmes of the \\ngovernment for food safety and quality policies. The last development plans on 'food industry' \\nand 'food safety, vegetable and veterinary' were prepared in 2007 for the next five years. The \\nreports were focused on the general situation and future expectations. \\n \\nThe SWOT analysis of the Turkish food industry performed by DPT highlights the \\nimportance of quality problems in the sector. According to the analysis there are two main \\nweaknesses in the Turkish food industry regarding quality: i) there is a real problem in the \\nsupply of high quality and homogenous raw materials, and ii) applications by enterprises of \\nfood safety and quality management systems are not at a satisfactory level. The analysis \\ndefines opportunities in food quality: i) legislation is increasingly oriented towards EU \\nstandards and the preparation for EU accession may have a positive influence on the adoption \\nof further legislation, ii) the Turkish food industry has the potential to process diversified \\norganic and ecological products and iii) food companies are increasingly oriented towards \\ndeveloping quality management systems (ISO, HACCP, GAP) (DPT, 2006). Implementation \\nof geographical indications (GIs) started in 1995 in Turkey. As of January 2009, 107 products \\nare registered with a geographical indication certificate and 65 of them are agricultural and \\nfood products (www.tpe.gov.tr, accessed 31.01.2009). It is obvious that the application of EU \\nfood quality standards through adjustments to food safety, environmental and other standards \\nshould begin in the early stages of the accession process. This is because EU safety and \\nquality standards will need to be implemented progressively, to allow enough time for food \\nprocessors and farmers to prepare, if they have a well-defined and credible timetable, for \\nspecific adjustments.  \\n \\n2.1.2. Autonomous and private bodies (semi-public organisations)  \\nTurkish Accreditation Agency (T\\u00dcRKAK) \\nT\\u00dcRKAK was established in 1998 with 33 employees. T\\u00dcRKAK acts as the major \\norganisation for conformity assessment. It aims to provide information and advice to the \\nprivate sector, particularly in industrial regions which are far from the central decision-\\n 16\\nmaking process. At present, accreditation decisions are taken by an authorized committee \\ncomposed of a general secretary and two deputies. \\n \\n  \\nFigure 2: Accreditation mechanism of T\\u00dcRKAK in Turkey  \\n \\n 17\\nSince April 2006 T\\u00dcRKAK has formed part of the European co-operation for Accreditation \\nMultilateral Agreement (EA MLA) for testing, calibration, inspection and Quality \\nManagement System (QMS) certification. T\\u00dcRKAK has been evaluated for product \\ncertification, Environmental Management Systems (EMS) and certification of personnel. In \\nMay 2006, T\\u00dcRKAK signed the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation - Mutual \\nRecognition Arrangement (ILAC MRA) for testing and calibration. In June 2006, T\\u00dcRKAK \\nbecame a member of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF). \\n \\nTable 2: List of accredited bodies by T\\u00dcRKAK (See Annex B for detailed information) \\nList of accredited firms and institutions  Food related accreditation Total \\nTesting laboratories 27 152 \\nCalibration laboratories - 44 \\nQuality Management System (QMS) 26 37 \\nInspection bodies 2 30 \\nProduct certification bodies 3 6 \\nPersonnel certification bodies 2 8 \\nSource: www.turkak.org.tr  (Access date, 20 August 2008).  \\n \\nThe Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) concept was introduced in Turkey \\nwith the TGKY (Turkish Food Codex Regulation) in 1997. TGKY quite clearly describes the \\nprinciples and application steps of HACCP to be incorporated in food plants to achieve the \\nhygienic conditions defined. All food sectors are foreseen to be covered, but a period of \\nadaptation has been provided before making HACCP compulsory and subject to official \\ninspections. Many food manufacturing and/or retailing companies in different fields of the \\nfood producing sectors started to employ the HACCP system from 1997 on, particularly food \\nmanufacturers exporting to EU countries since it is compulsory in the framework of the \\ncustoms union.  \\n \\nThe HACCP system has become compulsory both for the domestic market and all export \\ndestinations with the 'Regulation on Market Surveillance and Control of Food and Food \\nContact Materials and Responsibility of Food Business Operators' of 30.03.2005 and repealed \\nby the 'Regulation on Inspection and Control of Food Safety and Quality' (9.12.2007, No. \\n26725). This regulation was abolished by the State Council at the end of August 2008 because \\nof incompatibility with Municipality Laws and a new legislation, with the same content, was \\npublished on 26.09.2008. Since 31.03.2008 (Regulation on Inspection and Control of Food \\nSafety and Quality) all food manufacturers must apply the HACCP quality assurance system. \\n \\nISO 22000, a new common standard for the supply of safe food since September 2005, should \\nreplace all HACCP standards. However, it is not expected that ISO 22000 replaces private \\nstandards like British Retail Consortium (BRC) and International Food Standards (IFS). The \\nmain differences are as follows: ISO 22000 could be intended to be used by organisations \\nthroughout the food chain and appears to be less prescriptive than private standards, in that it \\ndoes not address control lists of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), Good Hygiene \\nPractices or other prerequisites in detail. ISO 22000 was published by TSE as TS EN ISO \\n22000 in October 2006. The certification process of TS EN ISO 22000 and other QMS is \\nconducted by T\\u00dcRKAK accredited private certification firms. In addition, the certification \\nprocess of BRC, IFS and other private standards (such as GlobalGAP and Tesco\\u2019s Nature \\nChoice (TNC)) is also carried by these certification firms; however, based on accreditation in \\nforeign countries. \\n \\n 18\\nTable 3: Food manufacturing firms using quality assurance systems in Turkey \\nSub-sector Certificate types Capacity Firms    \\nIFS 20 000 tons/year Ayta\\u00e7 \\nISO 22000 20 000 tons/year Ayta\\u00e7, Ba\\u015fyaz\\u0131c\\u0131. \\nHACCP- TS \\n13001 \\n3 000-99 500 tons/year Alt\\u0131nkaya, Etsan/Apiko\\u011flu, \\u015ealvarl\\u0131et, Y\\u0131lmazlar Et, \\n\\u0130kbal, Sultan Et, Namet, P\\u0131nar Et, Van Et, Alt\\u0131n \\nEt,Maret. \\nISO 14001 99 500 tons/year P\\u0131nar Et \\nMeat and meat \\nproducts \\nISO 9001:2000 3 000-99 500 tons/year  Ayta\\u00e7, P\\u0131nar Et, Alt\\u0131nkaya, Etsan/Apiko\\u011flu, \\u0130kbal, \\nSultan Et, Namet, Ba\\u015fyaz\\u0131c\\u0131, Maret \\nHACCP- TS \\n13001 \\n50 000-240 000 \\nunits/day \\nCP G\\u0131da A.\\u015e., Banvit, Beypili\\u00e7, Er Pili\\u00e7, \\u015een Pili\\u00e7, \\nKeskino\\u011flu, \\u015eeker Pili\\u00e7, K\\u00f6y-Tur, Emre Pili\\u00e7. \\nISO 14001 240 000 units/day, 250 \\ntons/day. \\nCP G\\u0131da A.\\u015e., Banvit, \\u015eeker Pili\\u00e7, Emek. \\nOHSAS 18001 90 000-200 000 \\nunits/day  \\nCP G\\u0131da A.\\u015e, Keskino\\u011flu A.\\u015e. \\nBroiler \\nISO 9001:2000 50 000-240 000 \\nunits/day \\nCP G\\u0131da A.\\u015e., Banvit, Beypili\\u00e7, \\u015een Pili\\u00e7, \\nKeskino\\u011flu, \\u015eeker Pili\\u00e7, K\\u00f6y-Tur, Emre Pili\\u00e7, Lezita. \\nBRC-IFS 30 000 tons/year Tunay A.\\u015e. \\nISO 22000 25 500-250 000 \\ntons/year \\nYa\\u015far Holding (P\\u0131nar), Asya G\\u0131da, Y\\u00f6rsan A.\\u015e., \\nK\\u0131z\\u0131kl\\u0131 A.\\u015e. \\nHACCP-ISO \\n13001 \\n30 000-300 000 \\ntons/year \\nYa\\u015far Holding, Dimes, G\\u00fclsan, Asya, Frigo-Pak, \\nEtap, Yummy A.\\u015e., Yimpa\\u015f A.\\u015e., Tunay A.\\u015e., \\nMeykon,  \\nISO 14001 154 000-350 000 \\ntons/year \\nYa\\u015far Holding, Dimes, Y\\u00f6rsan \\nISO 17025 350 000 tons/year Y\\u00f6rsan A.\\u015e. \\nFruit juice \\nISO 9001:2000 200 000-350 000 \\ntons/year \\nAkman A.\\u015e., Aroma, G\\u00f6knur, G\\u00fclsan, Asya, Etap, \\nTAT, Y\\u00f6rsan, Yimpa\\u015f, Yummy, K\\u0131z\\u0131kl\\u0131, Tunay, \\nMeykon \\nBRC-IFS 2 100 tons/day Ak G\\u0131da A.\\u015e. \\nISO 22000 250 000-450 000 \\ntons/year \\nBah\\u00e7\\u0131van A.\\u015e., Cebel A.\\u015e., Danone Tikve\\u015fli A.\\u015e., \\nEker A.\\u015e., P\\u0131nar A.\\u015e., Y\\u00f6rsan A.\\u015e. \\nHACCP-ISO \\n13001 \\n50-600 tons/day, \\n120 000-150 000 \\ntons/year \\nDimes A.\\u015e., Ekiciler, Enka, \\u0130timat, Kaanlar, Kars-\\nkarper A.\\u015e., S\\u00fcta\\u015f, Teks\\u00fct, Y\\u00f6r\\u00fck, Y\\u00f6r\\u00fcko\\u011flu  \\nISO 14001 120 000-350 000 tons \\n/year \\nDimes, P\\u0131nar, Y\\u00f6rsan \\nISO 9001:2000 150-2 100 tons/day Ak g\\u0131da, Ays\\u00fct, Bah\\u00e7\\u0131van, Eker, Enka, G\\u00fcneys\\u00fct, \\n\\u0130timat, Kaanlar, Kars-Karper, P\\u0131nar, S\\u00fcta\\u015f, Y\\u00f6rsan, \\nY\\u00f6r\\u00fck, Y\\u00f6r\\u00fcko\\u011flu  \\nISO 17025 1 200 tons/day Y\\u00f6rsan A.\\u015e. \\nMilk and milk \\nproducts \\nISO 15161 1 200 tons/day S\\u00fcta\\u015f \\nUSDA Organic 75 tons/day, \\n24 000 tons/year \\nEK\\u0130Z \\nBRC 130.000 tons/year Zade \\nISO 22000 130.000 tons/year Zade \\nHACCP-ISO \\n13001 \\n75 tons/day,  \\n130.000 tons/year \\nTAR\\u0130\\u015e, Ekiz, Zade, Oro-Alt\\u0131n\\u00e7, Heybe \\nISO 14001 130.000 tons/year Zade, Komili \\nISO 17025 130.000 tons/year Zade \\nOlive and olive \\noils \\nISO 9001:2000 24 000-130 000 \\ntons/year \\nTari\\u015f, Oru\\u00e7o\\u011flu, Ekiz, Zade, Oro-Alt\\u0131n\\u00e7 A.\\u015e. \\nIFS 1 350 tons/day,  \\n25 000 m2 \\n\\u00dclker \\nBRC 1 350 tons/day \\u00dclker, Halk \\nHACCP-ISO \\n13001 \\n100 \\u2013 1 350 tons/day \\u00dclker, An\\u0131, \\u015eim\\u015fek, Eti, Halk, Saray \\nISO 14001 600 tons/day Halk, Saray \\nISO 18001 600 tons/day Halk \\nBiscuit, chocolate \\nand candies \\nISO 9001:2000 100 -

Legislation for food quality assurance schemes in Turkey  \\n2.2.1. Food law \\nThe 'Umumi Hifzisihha Kanunu', UHK, (General Code of Health Protection), adapted in 1930 \\nfrom the respective Swiss law, covered regulations regarding official food controls in addition \\nto many other aspects of public health issues. Later in 1952 a new but this time more specific \\nregulation, 'Gida Maddeleri Nizamnamesi', (Food Commodities Regulation), was developed \\nto further cover detailed aspects of food controls to be carried out by governmental bodies. \\nTogether with the individual food commodity standards developed by the TSE (Turkish \\nStandards Institution), following its foundation in 1960, some of which were mandated in the \\nlocal market, these three documents formed the basis of official food controls in Turkey. \\nThere were, however, numerous articles in 'Gida Maddeleri Nizamnamesi' which were \\ncontradictory to the respective mandated Turkish standards requirements, but, in 1982, a \\ndecree was issued indicating that in cases of disagreement between the two, the respective \\nmandated Turkish standards were to be taken as the final judicial opinion, since these were \\nprepared in conformance with the respective international standards on the subject and \\nreflected the latest developments in modern food science and technology (F.L.I.P., 2000).  \\n \\nThe first comprehensive food law in Turkey was Decree Law No. 560 enacted in 1995 which \\ncovers production, consumption and inspection of food, and aiming to protect public health \\nagainst all possible food related risks and inspect food at all stages of the food chain (Alpay, \\n2001(a)). A set of regulations were prepared and published in the Official Gazette, \\nspecifically prepared for the harmonisation of the national food control system with EU food \\nlegislation. The pioneering ones were the regulations describing, in detail, the Good \\nManufacturing Practices (GMPs) in food producing plants in 1996 and the Turkish Food \\nCodex (Turk Gida Kodeksi Yonetmeligi-TGKY) which contains chapters similar to the \\nhorizontal EU legislation, with corresponding specific communiqu\\u00e9s on food additives, food \\ncontaminants, food packaging, food labelling and food hygiene. The TGKY had foreseen the \\n 21\\npreparation of vertical codex documents covering individual commodity types, and with \\nimmediate effect many of these replaced the previously mandated Turkish standards and 'Gida \\nMaddeleri Nizamnamesi' articles. The other important regulation regarding food safety is the \\n'Regulation on Production, Consumption and Inspection of Foods' published on 9.06.1998 in \\nthe Official Gazette No. 23367. This regulation was prepared in accordance with former EU \\nregulation 93/99/EEC of 29.10.1993 on the subject of additional measures concerning the \\nofficial control of foodstuffs and regulation 93/43/EEC on the hygiene of foodstuffs. The \\n'Regulation on Production, Consumption and Inspection of Foods' was the first regulation to \\ninclude the HACCP concept in Turkish food laws. TKB and the Ministry of Health jointly \\ntook responsibility for implementing food safety legislation according to Turkish food \\nlegislation after 1995.  \\n \\nFollowing the release of EU food law Regulation (EC) 178/2002, the food decree-law No. \\n560 was modified and converted into 'Food Law No. 5179' on 27.05.2004 (published in the \\nOfficial Gazette on 5.06.2004, No. 25483). With this new food law, TKB became the \\ncompetent authority for inspecting all stages of food from production to consumption and \\ntook over full responsibility for the inspection of food safety. However, there was a great \\ndifference between EU food law and new Turkish food law. Turkish food law does not \\ninclude feed and veterinary concepts, which completes food safety controls from 'farm to fork' \\nbut rather it keeps them as separate regulations. A new draft law, including feed and \\nveterinary issues, has been prepared to harmonise Turkish food law with EU food laws (see \\nAnnex A for detailed list) and published in June 2010 as \\u201cVeterinarian Services, Crop Health, \\nFood and Feed Law No. 5996 (Official Gazette, 13.06.2010; No. 27610). \\n \\n2.2.2. Laws and regulations to improve quality of agricultural production \\nThe value-added production in crops is related to the quality of reproduction materials with \\nhigh quality and higher genetic potential in line with standards. Therefore, the new Seed Law \\nNo. 5553, which was prepared to amend the Law on Registration, Control, and Certification \\nof Seeds (No.308 and from 1963) in line with the EU harmonisation process and by taking \\ninto account international seed systems and advanced technologies, was enacted on \\n31.10.2006.  \\n \\nWith the 'Regulation for Controlled Greenhouse Production' (27.12.2003 Official Gazette No. \\n25329), Turkey started adapting Good Agricultural Production (GAP) standards related to \\nimportant Turkish export products, such as greenhouse vegetables. Moreover, GlobalGAP \\n(formerly used as EurepGAP) was converted into Turkish legislation and published in the \\nOfficial Gazette No. 25577 as 'Regulation on Good Agricultural Practices' on 8.09.2004. \\nSince this regulation came into effect, a total area of approximately 5 300 ha has been \\ncertified, mainly in provinces in the South such as Adana (3 000 ha), Mugla (5 000 ha.) and \\nMersin (4 000 ha.)7. The requirements of Turkish legislation and GlobalGAP are almost the \\nsame, however, Turkish certifications are not accepted worldwide. Furthermore, additional \\ncertifications are required by multinational supermarket chains such as Tesco\\u2019s Nature Choice \\n(TNC). \\n \\nDecree No. 2005/8503 of the Council of Ministers on 'Supporting Animal Husbandry', which \\nwas amended by the new Decree No. 2008/13695 on 24.05.2008, aims to increase the \\nproduction of roughage, promote the breeding of studs, spread the use of artificial \\n                                                 \\n7 The information on certified areas was taken from Section of ITU (GAP), TKB in May 2008 \\n 22\\ninsemination, and create regions free of animal diseases (DPT, 2006). In addition, works on \\nthe alignment of national legislation on livestock with the related EU regulations are under \\nway. In this context, an animal identification system is almost complete including all livestock \\npopulations in the system. Since 2005, the inclusion of new born cattle into the system and the \\nremoval of slaughtered or deceased animals has been done. A similar effort has commenced \\nto identify the sheep and goat population. \\n \\n2.2.3. Organic agriculture law \\nThe first By-Law of 'Organic Agriculture' was issued in 1994, adopting the EU definition of \\norganic agriculture following the entry into force of Council Regulation (EEC) 2092/91 in \\n1991. An amendment was made to overcome some malfunctions and sanctions were added \\nagainst fault and inaccuracy in organic agricultural activities with regulation No. 22328 on \\n29.06.1995 in the Official Gazette. \\n \\nIn 1999 rules on production, labelling and inspection of the most relevant animal species were \\nintroduced in the EU (Council Regulation (EC) 1804/1999 of 19.07.1999), covering issues \\nsuch as feed, disease prevention and veterinary treatments, animal welfare, husbandry \\npractices and the management of manure. In March 2000 the European Commission \\nintroduced with Commission Regulation (EC) 331/2000 of 17.12.1999 a logo bearing the \\nwords 'Organic Farming-EC Control System'. This logo can be used on a voluntary basis by \\nproducers whose systems and products have been found to satisfy Council Regulation (EEC) \\n2092/91. In Turkey, in 2002 the 'Regulation on Organic Agriculture Principles and \\nApplications' (Official Gazette No. 24812 on 11.07.2002) was enacted, and a comprehensive \\nOrganic Farming Law (No. 5262) has been in force as from 1.12.2004 in line with EU \\nRegulation (EEC) 2092/91. Moreover, a revised regulation came into force on 10.06.2005 \\n(Official Gazette No. 25841), but the Turkish organic agriculture legislation needs further \\nadjustments to comply with the new EU Regulation (EC) 834/2007 of 28.06.2007.   \\n \\nAccording to data published in 2007, approximately 200 000 hectares are used by 14 000 \\nfarmers for organic agriculture in Turkey. The majority of organic production is marketed \\nabroad, primarily in the EU, and exports have been steadily growing. The domestic demand \\nhas started to increase since the late 1990s but is still relatively small to the total food \\ndemand. TKB has the legal responsibility to oversee the cultivation of organic crops.  \\n \\nTKB created a specific Organic Agriculture Committee (OAC), which is the main decision-\\nmaking body. It prepares and implements regulations, authorises certification bodies, inspects \\nthese organisations and coordinates all other activities to improve and foster organic \\nagriculture (\\u0150zkan, 2002). The OAC is composed of representatives of the various \\ndirectorates of TKB. In support to the work of TKB, the Turkish Association of Organic \\nAgriculture, Wheat Association for Ecological Living and Organic Product Producers and \\nIndustrialists Association, provide policy input, contribute to technical improvements and \\ndevelop the domestic market for organic products. The members of these associations include \\nproducers, exporters, academics and consumers.  \\n \\nOrganic farming units have been established in the provincial agricultural directorates. The \\naim is to provide help to certification bodies with specialised staff, to collect data required by \\nstandards, and to perform inspections and certifications of companies as technical auditors. \\nThere are currently thirteen certification bodies established in Turkey.  \\n \\n 23\\nThe export of organic products to the EU requires the registration of a third country as \\ncomplying with a set of rules. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made the \\napplication to be listed as a third country complying with these rules.  \\n \\n2.2.4. Decree-law for geographical indications \\nIn 1992, the EU created systems known as PDO (Protected Designation of Origin), PGI \\n(Protected Geographical Indication) and TSG (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed) to promote \\nand protect valuable food names under Regulations (EEC) No. 2081/92 and (EEC) No. \\n2082/92. \\n \\nPDO protects the name of a region, a specific place or, in exceptional cases, a country, used to \\ndescribe an agricultural product or food product. The product must originate in the specific \\nregion, place or country and possess a quality or characteristics which are essentially or \\nexclusive to a particular geographical environment, with its inherent natural and human \\nfactors. The production, processing and preparation of the product must take place in the \\ndefined geographical area. \\n \\nPGI also protects the name of a region, a specific place or, in exceptional cases, a country, \\nused to describe an agricultural or food product. The product must posses a specific quality or \\nother characteristics attributable to the geographical origin and the production and/or \\nprocessing and/or preparation take place in the defined geographical area. \\n \\nTSG is used for products with distinctive features which either have traditional ingredients or \\nare made using traditional methods (European Commission, 2007). \\n \\nIn March 2005, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) released a panel report regarding the \\nEuropean GI system (WTO, 2005). The conclusions and recommendations of the panel led \\nthe European Union to revise its rules regarding international GIs. Specifically, Regulation \\n(EC) 2081/92 was repealed, and replaced with Regulation (EC) 510/2006. The amendment \\naims to comply with the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights \\n(TRIPS) of the WTO. In particular, the new regulation allows the EU regulatory system to \\nrecognize and protect foreign GIs and allows foreign producers to apply directly for \\nregistration of GI products in the European Union. According to Regulation (EC) 510/2006, \\nto obtain geographical indication certifications, the applicant must apply to its national \\nauthority. After the evaluation, applications are transmitted to the European Commission for \\napproval. Following this procedure, Turkish products can also obtain EU certification, and \\n'Antep Baklavasi' (PGI in 2009) and 'Aydin \\u00cdnc\\u00edr\\u00ed' (PDO in 2010) have submitted their \\napplications in this way.  \\n \\nRegulation (EC) 510/2006 includes more detailed judgments from national legislation \\nregarding the inspection of geographical signs than Turkish Decree-Law No. 555. These \\ninspections have to be executed by independent and specialized control bodies accredited with \\nthe EN 45011 or ISO/IEC Guide 65 standards. This obligation must be accepted by both EU \\nand non-EU countries before 1.05.2010. Therefore, draft legislations have been prepared in \\naccordance with the new EU law and Regulation (EC) 1898/2006.  \\n \\nThe protection of Geographical Indications (GIs) in Turkey is provided by Decree-Law No. \\n555 pertaining to the 'Protection of Geographical Indications' of 27.06.1995 covering both \\nfood and non-food materials and was revised on 7.11.1995. There is no 'Traditional Speciality \\n 24\\nGuaranteed' concept either in this decree-law or in any other regulation compared to \\nRegulation (EC) 509/2006. However, the last draft includes both protection of geographical \\nsigns and traditional speciality.  \\n \\nThe authorized institute for the protection of GIs is the Turkish Patent Institute. As of August \\n2008, a total of 57 agricultural and food products have been approved by the Turkish Patent \\nInstitute. Thirty of the total protected products are agricultural products including grapes, \\nraisins, apricots, nuts, tobacco, cotton, roses, olives and olive oils. Twenty seven of them are \\nprocessed food and alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages including cheese, sausages, \\nprepared meals, candies, desserts, Turkish raki, turnip juice and honey. Moreover, 130 \\napplications for agricultural and processed food are on the waiting list to obtain the \\ngeographical indication protection or designation of origin (www.turkpatent.org.tr, access \\ndate 2 September, 2008). \\n \\nTable 6: Differences between EU and Turkish Geographical Protection Legislations \\nEU Regulations Basic Rules  Turkish Laws Basic Differences  \\nRegulation (EEC) 2081/92 \\nof 14.07.1992 on the \\nProtection of Geographical \\nIndications and \\nDesignations of Origin for \\nAgricultural Products and \\nFoods. \\n- lays down the rules on the \\nprotection of designations of \\norigin and geographical \\nindications for agricultural \\nproducts intended for human \\nconsumption (except wine) \\n- Only a group of natural or \\nlegal persons subject to \\ncertain conditions will be \\nentitled to apply for \\nregistration. \\nDecree-Law No. 555 \\nPertaining to the \\nProtection of \\nGeographical Signs in \\nForce from 27.06. 1995 \\n \\n- covers protecting the natural, \\nagricultural, mining and \\nindustrial products and \\nhandicrafts \\n- Groups, natural or legal \\npersons, who are producers of \\nthe product, could apply for \\nprotection. \\nRegulation (EC) No \\n510/2006 of 20.03.2006 on \\nthe Protection of \\nGeographical Indications \\nand Designations of Origin \\nfor Agricultural Products \\nand Foodstuffs. \\n- Registration of \\napplications from third \\ncountries could be achieved \\nwith the proof that the name \\nin question is protected in its \\ncountry of origin. \\n-A Member State or a third \\ncountry may object to the \\nproposed registration. \\nDraft Law on Pertaining \\nProtection of \\nGeographical Signs and \\nTraditional Speciality \\nGuaranteed Products \\n \\n- includes both geographical \\nsigns and traditional speciality \\n- Only groups could apply for \\nprotection. \\n- regulates the relationship of \\ndomestic with international \\nprotection, e.g. the protection in \\nEU \\n \\nThe protection of Geographical Indications (GIs) is not working properly in Turkey, as there \\nis no specific identification (logo) for products with GIs; only five registered products use \\ntheir own logo. Moreover, the consumption ratio of packaged products is low in Turkey \\ncompared to the EU; therefore the communication of GIs is more difficult in Turkey.  \\n \\nWhen the application of GIs has been made, the distinctive property or detailed identification \\nof the products must be declared. However, some of them are not sufficiently detailed, such as \\nKayseri sausages and dried meat (pastrami) (no specification for the origin of the meat is \\ngiven), while others are well detailed, like Erzincan Tulum cheese (e.g. milk from Karaman \\nsheep and the altitudes of the meadows are given in detail). There are three kinds of olive oil \\nwith a PDO certificate; Edremit Korfez Region olive oil and Ayvalik olive oil have \\noverlapping properties although they indicate different olive oil specialties. On the other hand, \\nspecific olive cultivars are indicated for Guney Ege olive oil produced in the South Aegean \\nRegion of Turkey.  \\nTable 7: Agricultural and food products with PDO and PGI

Law for inspection and standardisation of foreign trade \\nThe 'Decree on the Regime of Technical Regulations and Standardisation in Foreign Trade' is \\nin conformity with the requirements laid down in the Agreement on Technical Barriers to \\nTrade of the WTO. It prohibits discrimination among trading partners and aims to ensure \\ncompliance with the requirements for the protection of human health and safety, animal \\nwelfare or plant health, the environment and national security. However, this was a \\ntransitional regime for harmonisation with the Community legal system. The Regime and its \\nsupplementary legislation were decided on 24.1.1995 by the Council of Ministers and \\npublished in the Official Journal on 9.3.1995. This Decree is amended by Decree No. 96/7794 \\non 'The Regime for Technical Regulations and Standardisation in Foreign Trade' enacted on \\n8.1.1996 by the Council of Ministers. This Decree and its supplementary legislation which \\nconsists of Regulations and Communiqu\\u00e9s were promulgated in the Official Gazette on \\n1.2.1996 No. 22541. The Regulation and Communiqu\\u00e9s are amended every year.   \\n \\nAccording to the Regulation of the above mentioned Regime, there exists a total of 52 \\ninspection units called 'Inspectorates for Standardisation in Foreign Trade', within the eight \\nRegional Directorates (Marmara, Western Anatolia, South Anatolia, Eastern Black Sea, \\nWestern Black Sea, South Eastern Anatolia, Central Anatolia and Eastern Anatolia) under the \\nresponsibility of the Under-Secretary for Foreign Trade (DTM), and the General Directorate \\nfor the Standardisation in Foreign Trade. These inspection units issue the 'Inspection \\nCertificate(s)' for agricultural products to be exported/imported within the scope of product \\nstandards of the Turkish Standards Institution (TSE).  \\n \\nAgricultural products are subject to conformity inspection with regard to 70 Turkish \\nstandards. Formerly, this inspection was only carried out for exports. However the same \\nprocedure is now also applicable for imports. The inspection of agricultural products within \\nthe scope of the 70 standards prior to export and import will be performed by the Inspectors \\nfor Standardisation in Foreign Trade. These inspections are performed according to Turkish \\nstandards which are analogous to the respective OECD and EC standards. Exporters/importers \\nshould obtain an Inspection Certificate from the 'Inspectorates for Standardisation in Foreign \\nTrade'.  \\n \\nIndustrial products are subject to inspection by the TSE with regard to 614 standards, which \\nare applicable on the domestic market in Turkey. Importers should obtain the conformity \\ncertificate from TSE (similar to the CE mark in EC) before importing, since all products \\nshould conform to the relevant standard or regulation or technical document in respect of the \\nminimum requirements of human health and safety, animal welfare or plant health and \\nprotection of the environment, thus providing adequate information to the consumers at the \\nstage of the actual import. If the importer declares that the product is in conformity with the \\nrelevant international standards (ISO, CEN, IEC, CENELEC, ETSI), the Turkish inspection \\nmay be performed upon request according to these international standards. For products \\nalready certified according to the regulations of the European Union ('CE' Mark, 'E' Mark, 'e' \\nMark, etc.) and freely circulating in the European Union, a conformity certificate will be \\nissued directly in case the technical file is submitted to the Turkish Standards Institution \\nbefore importing. \\n \\n'The Regime for Technical Regulations and Standardisation in Foreign Trade' also regulates \\ncontrols to be carried out by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural \\nAffairs and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Pursuant to Communiqu\\u00e9 No.2005/5 \\n 29\\nrelating to human health and safety and Communiqu\\u00e9 No.99/5 relating to human health, \\nanimal welfare and plant health, the importation of certain specific goods is subject to a \\ncontrol certificate by the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. \\nThe scope of these product groups are as follows: \\n\\u2022 Pharmaceutical products, drugs, some consumable medical products, cosmetics and \\ndetergents (Ministry of Health); \\n\\u2022 Food, agricultural and animal products, veterinary products and plant protection \\nproducts (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs).  \\n \\nIn order to fulfil obligations from the customs union with the European Union, for products \\nwithin the scope of Communiqu\\u00e9 No. 25373 of 14.2.2004, and amended in the Turkish \\nOfficial Gazette with No. 25996 of 17.11.2005, bearing a CE mark and freely circulating in \\nthe European Union, a conformity certificate will be issued directly in case the technical file \\nhas been submitted to the Ministry of Health before the import stage.  \\n \\nIn order to obtain a control certificate, a pro-forma invoice for the product must be presented \\nto the corresponding Ministry. Furthermore, depending on the type of the product, the \\nfollowing documents will be presented to the Ministry: a Health Certificate, an analysis \\ncertificate, a formula or list of contents of the product, pedigree certificate, radiation analysis \\nreport, etc. These documents, particularly a health and/or analysis certificate should be \\nobtained from and/or approved by the public authorities of the producer country. They should \\nbe originals and a translation is required for each, including the pro-forma invoice. A control \\ncertificate must be obtained prior to importation and presented to the Customs Administration \\nduring the actual import. The validity of the control certificate remains 6 to 12 months, \\ndepending on the product inspected.  \\n \\n2.3. Policies to support food quality in Turkey  \\nAccording to the Organic Agriculture Law and Implementing Regulation, organic fresh \\nvegetable and fruits are exempted from the rule that all fresh fruits and vegetables for \\nwholesale or retail sale are obliged to pass through market halls. Thus, saving the 14.4 % \\ndeduction applied to the producer\\u2019s price and the hall agent\\u2019s fee of 8 % of the selling price. \\n \\nIn Turkey, basic Direct Income Support (DIS) is given on the basis of the land on which plant \\nproduction is carried out and, since 2005, additional payments are given to the farmers who \\nobtain soil analysis or farm organically. Subsidised credits were in 2004 to encourage farmers \\nto produce organically, according to ITU or perform controlled greenhouse production.    \\n \\n 30\\nTable 8: Agricultural subsidy for quality improvement9 \\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Subsidy and \\npremiums  (M TL) (M TL) (M TL) (M TL) (YTL) (YTL) (YTL) (YTL) \\nDirect Income Support \\n(DIS) (da)* 10.00 13.50 16.00 16.00 16.00 16.00 10.00 10.00 \\nSoil analysis addition \\nto DIS (da) - - - - - - 1.00 1.00 \\nOrganic Farming \\naddition to DIS (da)  - - - - - - 3.00 3.00 \\nBombus bees support \\nin greenhouse \\nproduction (colony)  \\n- - - - - - - 50 \\nUse of certified seeds \\nand saplings - - - - \\n6 \\nproducts \\n6 \\nproducts \\n11 \\nproducts \\n11 \\nproducts \\nAdditional premium for \\nusing certified seeds  \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean  \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nCotton \\nand \\nsoybean \\nSupport to certified \\nseed production for \\nfeed \\n- - - - - - 3 products \\n3 \\nproducts \\nSubsidised credit (deduction ratio on Agricultural Bank credit interest rate) \\nControlled greenhouse \\nproduction - - - 40% 40% 40% 40% 40% \\nITU (GAP) - - - - - 60% 60% 60% \\nOrganic Farming  - - - - - 60% 60% 60% \\nCertified seed usage - - - - - 60% 60% 60% \\nCertified fruit saplings - - - - - 50% 50% 50% \\nCertified seed \\nproduction - - - - - 50% 50% 50% \\nBio-safety in poultry - - - - - 60% 60% 60% \\nSource: based on TKB annual support data. \\n* DIS does not contribute to quality production itself.  \\n \\nAgricultural support for controlled greenhouse production and ITU (GAP) is only subsidised \\nthrough credits.

Furthermore, a 60% deduction \\nis applicable in case of organic farming or certified ITU (GAP).  \\n \\n2.4. Literature review and projects implemented on food quality \\nin Turkey  \\nThere is no comprehensive study on food quality assurance schemes in Turkey as food quality \\nhas only recently become an important issue. Food quality has become increasingly important \\ndue to standards in importing countries, including the EU and the Russian Federation food \\nsafety legislations, and standards of private global retailers' such as Kipa-Tesco, CarrefourSA \\nand Metro Group in the domestic market. Also consumers' fears about food scares stemming \\nfrom diseases such as avian influenza increased the importance of food safety and quality. \\nGenerally, quality is mainly perceived as food safety and additional attributes are less in the \\nfocus of the Turkish agricultural and food sector. Important available reports and research \\npapers on food quality and safety issues are discussed as follows. \\n \\nPreviously Alpay et al (2001(b)) discussed the harmonisation of Turkish quality assurance \\nprocedure with EU quality standards. The competitiveness of the Turkish food industry in the \\nEU market was analysed from a quality, food safety and environmental perspective. An \\nimpact analysis of HACCP adoption by food industry on export performance was conducted. \\n                                                 \\n9 (1) decare (da) is equal to 0.1 hectare (ha), and 1 Euro = 1.80 YTL = 1 800 000 TL, approximately. \\n 31\\nEmpirical analysis of the data from a survey of 92 food firms indicated that the main \\ncompetitive factors for the Turkish food manufacturing firms in the EU market were: costs, \\nimproving product quality and adapting food safety standards.  \\n \\nDolekoglu (2003) performed a survey of 302 households in Adana to clarify consumers' \\nunderstanding of food quality preferences, safety requirements and basic product properties. It \\nwas found that consumers' preferences on food quality (especially for trusted trademarks) \\nwere as important as the price of the products in various markets. Moreover, economic \\nfeatures should be improved to supply access to more safe and nutritional food for basic \\nrequirements of people's diets. Dolekoglu also indicated that it is essential for producers, \\nretailers and consumers to be informed and advised about quality, safety and even consumers' \\nrights. \\n \\nOskam et al. (2004) carried out a study to provide a comprehensive overview of Turkey\\u2019s \\nagricultural and food sectors and the situation in its rural areas which was then used to \\nexamine potential consequences of Turkey\\u2019s EU accession. It was reported that Turkey\\u2019s \\naccession to the EU offers certain opportunities to the agricultural and food sectors such as \\nincreasing security and political stability in the south eastern region of the EU in the scope of \\nillegal movements of goods, livestock and people across these borders. In addition, there are \\nstrong opportunities for the profitable export of goods, services, know-how and capital to the \\nTurkish market from the EU. Moreover, Turkey has a large territory rich in biodiversity, and \\nwith less environmental problems than many EU members. \\n \\nGuittard (2006) prepared a report on the food safety situation in Turkey. The main results of \\nthe report are the following. Despite the significant ongoing efforts to improve the Turkish \\nfood safety situation, many gaps need to be filled. More cooperation between the agricultural \\nsector and industry would be a key factor to improving food safety in the food chain. The \\ngoodwill demonstrated by Turkish authorities in openly cooperating with international bodies \\nprovided them with an extremely valuable learning process. With the experience gained they \\nare now much better prepared to manage future crises and communicate risks more effectively \\nand quickly. In order to execute the tasks required under the food safety acquis, it seems \\nnecessary to restructure and strengthen TKB. Special attention should be paid to reinforce and \\nupgrade the control systems. Food processing operations should be improved with regard to \\ntechnical and hygienic conditions. \\n \\nThe State Planning Organisation (DPT) of the Prime Minister published two special \\ncommission reports entitled 'Food Industry Expert Committee Report' and 'Food Safety, \\nPhytosanitary and Veterinary Expert Committee' for the 9th Development Plan (2007-2013) \\n(http://ekutup.dpt.gov.tr/oik/plan9.asp, accessed August 2008). The food safety, phytosanitary \\nand veterinary report extensively focused on food safety while the food industry report \\nfocused on the preparation of the Turkish food industry for competition in the EU market. It \\nwas also highlighted that the competitiveness of the industry for export, through science and \\ntechnology, should be increased. The food industry report mentioned that quality analyses, \\nR&D activities, consulting and training activities have been major accomplishments during \\nthe last decade. The following results have been highlighted in the reports to better prepare \\nthe food industry sector during the accession period:  \\n\\u2022 increase non-governmental organisation and private sector initiatives in the \\nproduction-consumption chain; \\n\\u2022 reduce raw material costs by tax regulations and prevent unregistered production; \\n 32\\n\\u2022 decrease raw material costs via productivity gains and competitive input price for \\nenterprises enabling competitiveness, hygiene and coherence with EU standards; \\n\\u2022 constant supply of animal- and plant-based raw material at affordable prices, fulfilling \\nhygiene and safety standards; \\n\\u2022 increase of food related R&D activities in public investment expenditure; \\n\\u2022 encouragement of industries to invest in science, technology and R&D; \\n\\u2022 an efficient control of the food chain from 'farm to fork' by protecting the rights of \\nboth the producer and consumer. \\n \\nG\\u00f6nen\\u00e7 (2007) published a research paper entitled 'preventive factors which distort the \\nprotective mechanism of Geographical Indications'. The author conducted a consumer survey \\nof 570 households in the Bursa Province on Gemlik Olives certified with 'Protected \\nDesignation of Origin' (PDO) and a producer survey on Mustafa Kemal Pa\\u015fa Tatl\\u0131s\\u0131 (dessert) \\ncertified with PGI. The author also reviewed distinguishing or differentiating attributes of \\ncertified products in the official documents. She concluded that the lack of consumer and \\nproducer information about GIs and also inefficiently defined distinguishing attributes of \\ncertified products are the major factors hindering the spread of GIs. \\n \\nG\\u00f6nen\\u00e7 (2006) also published a research paper entitled 'Geographical Indication in European \\nUnion and Turkish olive sector and the role of producers' organisation'. The author compared \\napplicants for PDOs in EU Member States and Turkey. She indicated that PDO applicants in \\nthe olive sector are cooperatives, chambers of commodity exchange markets and chambers of \\ncommerce in Turkey as opposed to cooperatives and producer unions in EU Member States.  \\n \\nKo\\u00e7 (2006) prepared a report on the Turkish food quality management system that includes \\nthe evaluation of food safety and quality legislation in Turkey. Moreover, he provided case \\nstudies from different sectors such as the tomato processing, broiler and dairy sectors. Finally, \\nhe conducted a SWOT analysis on the tomato industry. The report indicated that Turkey has a \\nlong history of successful quality management of food safety and quality in certain food \\nsectors, which has been evolving rapidly.  \\n \\nTekelioglu and Demirer (2008) documented the historical evolution of Geographical \\nIndications (GI) in Europe and compared the EU and Turkish legislation, and the current \\nsituation of PDOs and PGIs. They provided an inventory of PDO and PGI certified products \\nby country and commodity groups both in the EU and in Turkey. Moreover, it was also \\nindicated that 60% of Turkish agricultural export earnings are composed of GI protected \\nproducts such as Giresun hazelnuts, Malatya apricots, Sultani raisins, Ege figs and Antep \\npistachio nuts.  \\n \\nAvailable technical reports and studies focus mainly on food safety and highlight the \\nimportance of food quality and safety for exports and in the accession process to full EU \\nmembership. As seen from the literature review, food quality assurance schemes in Turkey \\nhave not been comprehensively analysed, including economic feasibility of quality protected \\nproducts, compliance cost for producer by scale, factors and policies preventing development \\nof collectively managed quality brand and so on.  \\n \\nTable 9: Implemented projects  \\nName of the project Participating \\ninstitutions and \\norganisations \\nSource of funding and \\nbudget \\nPeriod Objectives Indications or results \\nEU programme 'Support to \\nthe Quality Infrastructure \\nin Turkey' project \\nThe Under-Secretary of \\nForeign Trade, \\nDirectorate General for \\nStandardisation (DG) and \\nTurkish Society for \\nQuality (KalDer) \\n\\u20ac 13 million funded by the \\nDelegation of the European \\nCommission to Turkey and \\nmanaged by the European \\nCommittee for \\nStandardisation (CEN), \\nthrough the Expertise Centre \\n(ExC) in Ankara and \\nadministered by the British \\nStandards Institution (BSI). \\nStarted in \\nJuly 2002 and \\nended in \\n2007 \\nThis project was designed to support \\nTurkish private and public sectors, in the \\nprocess of technical harmonisation and \\naligning their quality infrastructure with that \\nof the EU in relation to the Customs Union, \\nmore specifically related to technical \\nbarriers to trade. \\nThis project extensively focused on standardisation and \\naccreditation, including testing, certification, inspection \\nand metrology.

SWOT analysis of the food quality assurance schemes \\nin Turkey \\nThe workshop on 'Food Quality Assurance Schemes in Candidate Countries: Turkey' (FQAS-\\nTURK) was held in Antalya on 7 and 8 October, 2008 in the meeting hall of the Faculty of \\nEconomics and Administrative Sciences (FEAS). \\n \\nThe aim of the workshop was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the existing food \\nquality system in Turkey. In order to fulfil this purpose, institutions related to food quality in \\nTurkey as well as NGOs were invited. Representatives of different departments of the \\nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA), the Turkish Patent Institute (TPE), the \\nRegional Exports Union (Antalya), the Undersecretary for Foreign Trade (DTM), the Turkish \\nStandards Institution (TSE), the National Productivity Centre (MPM), the Mercantile \\nExchange (Izmir), private companies and academics from universities participated in the \\nworkshop (Annex C. Participant list). \\n \\nThe workshop was officially opened with the welcome speeches of Prof. Dr. A. Ali Ko\\u00e7 and \\nDean of the FEAS, Prof. Dr. \\u015eafak Aksoy; then Dr. Fatma Handan Giray from JRC-IPTS \\npresented the project 'Economics of Food Quality Assurance and Certification Schemes \\nmanaged within an integrated Supply Chain in EU' carried out by the Institute of Prospective \\nTechnological Studies, one of the institutes of the European Commission's Joint Research \\nCentre (EU JRC- IPTS), and the objectives and structure of the FQAS-TURK project. The \\nmorning session was completed with the presentation of Serhat A\\u015f\\u00e7\\u0131 summarizing the first \\nphase of the project and providing detailed information about the mechanisms of the current \\nTurkish food quality assurance and outcomes of other related projects and academic reports. \\n \\nIn order to determine the strengths and weaknesses of Turkish food quality schemes, the \\nanalysis was made on three basic topics as follows: \\n1) the gathering of information on food quality assurance certification systems (working \\nprinciples);  \\n2) existing discussions on and potential interests in EU food quality systems (PDO, PGI, \\nTSG);  \\n3) analysis of potential food products that can compete with those in the EU markets. \\n \\nIn this workshop, a SWOT analysis and a Logical Framework Approach (LFA) were used to \\ncollect data from workshop participants. A SWOT analysis is used to identify and categorize \\nsignificant internal (Strengths and Weaknesses) and external (Opportunities and Threats) \\nfactors. Therefore, only Strengths and Weaknesses were obtained directly from participants \\nfor the Turkish food quality assurance scheme, and Opportunities and Threats were derived \\nfrom these answers.  \\n \\nFirstly, the Turkish terminology for food quality assurance was discussed as some \\norganisations were using different definitions for food quality, food safety and food security \\nin Turkey. Therefore, all participants had to define food quality and assurance. Definitions \\nwere collected and a common idea was reached with regards to the meaning of these terms. \\n \\nFor the other parts of the SWOT analysis, papers were distributed and, Strengths and \\nWeaknesses were examined in the three parts. Firstly 'information on food quality assurance \\ncertification system' focussed on the current situation of the working principles of institutions, \\n 36\\norganisations and mechanisms. Secondly 'existing and potential interests to EU food quality \\nsystems' looked to current and future expectations of Turkish firms and institutions regarding \\nfood quality systems. Finally 'potential food products able to compete with those in the EU \\nmarkets' elaborated on the competitiveness of Turkish products. \\n \\nAfter obtaining the data from the SWOT analysis, Weaknesses and Threats were taken as \\nproblems as a basis for the Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) analysis.

Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) analysis of food \\nquality assurance schemes in Turkey  \\nAt the third stage of the project 'Food Quality Assurance Schemes in Candidate Countries: \\nTurkey' (FQAS-TURK), a workshop was organised in the Culture and Convention Centre at \\nthe Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara on 26 November, 2008 (Annex D: \\nAgenda and participants list). The aim of the workshop was to inform participants about the \\nprevious stages of the project and to elaborate the preliminary Logical Framework Matrix \\n(LFM) obtained from the first workshop held in Antalya.  \\n \\nIn order to satisfy the above mentioned objectives, the essential participants invited for the \\nworkshop were: SET-BIR (Union of Dairy, Beef, Food Industrialists and Producers), BESD-\\nBIR (Poultry Meat Producers and Breeders Association), TURKYEM-BIR (Turkish Feed \\nManufacturers\\u2019 Association), Union of Food and Beverages Industrialists, Consumers\\u2019 Union, \\nProducer Cooperatives (Koy-koop, TARIS etc), Regional and Central Producer Unions \\n(Dairy, Vegetable, Fruit, Greenhouse etc), Food Safety Association, Organic and Ecological \\nProduction Associations, Chambers of Food and Agricultural Engineering. Most of the \\ninvited organisations and institutes attended the workshop.  \\n \\n4.1. Methodology \\nThe Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) incorporated opinions, ideas and contributions of \\nstakeholders. Producer organisations, food processing industry associations and cooperatives \\nin the food sector were invited to the workshop in Ankara for a broad contribution. The \\nproject team moderated the LFM discussion based on the preliminary LFM which was \\nextracted from previous workshops based on data from the SWOT analysis.  \\n \\nThe LFM workshop started with the opening speech of Prof. Dr. A. Ali Ko\\u00e7. Thereafter, \\nSerhat A\\u015f\\u00e7\\u0131 presented the outcomes of the first phase of the project on current Turkish food \\nquality assurance schemes, related projects and academic studies. Secondly, the SWOT \\nresults related to Turkish food quality assurance schemes were presented by Assoc. Prof. Dr. \\nHami Alpas and field findings were shared in a presentation made by Prof. Dr. A. Ali Ko\\u00e7 \\ntitled 'Interest, Knowledge Level and Expectations of Local Stakeholders and Producers from \\nFood Quality Assurance Systems in Turkey'.  \\n \\nThe preliminary LFM results were explained; and the specific analysis techniques and \\nmethodology were presented. Secondly, the problems of food quality assurance schemes and \\npreliminary sub-topics were detailed by the project team. At that point, opinions and \\ncontributions of participants were gathered and some changes to the sub-topics were made for \\nclarification. The preliminary problem list was rearranged according to some minor changes \\nand formed the basis for further work. Moreover, cause-result relationships and major/minor \\nproblems, obtained from the preceding work, were assessed and contributions obtained. At \\nthe second stage, a problem tree was generated. At the final stage, the audience focused on the \\nLFM table. Each subject was discussed intensively on a matrix table and participants' \\ncontributions and opinions for the missing parts were gathered by the project team. \\nDiscussion was sustained until each part of the matrix table was approved by the participants. \\nAt the end of the workshop, the final LFM was presented once more and participants' final \\napproval was obtained. \\n \\n 41\\nAdditions to the preliminary LFM are as follows. The issues in the preliminary problem list \\nwere not changed but rearranged; (1) 'labelling' was added to consumer trust, (2) 'lack of \\nimplementation and auditing after certification process, especially in geographical indications \\n(GI\\u2019s)', were added to make this point more complete. The cause-effect relationship was \\ndeeply discussed and one of the minor problems was divided into two following the \\ndiscussion with participants: 'legislation' and 'coordination among food chain players'. Thus, \\nthe cause-effect table and problem tree were revised with minor changes. Therefore, the LFM \\nwas adjusted accordingly. The LFM was also improved with the addition of new assumptions \\non overall and specific objectives; (1) infrastructure investments to improve food quality \\nassurance schemes will be sustained by TKB (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs) and \\nrelated institutes in order to fulfil the demands of the markets, (2) improvement of the quality \\nassurance and traceability system will be sustained according to the demand of export \\nmarkets, (3) organisation campaigns intended to raise public awareness, supported by sector \\nassociations (NGOs), TKB and other public institutes. Moreover, 'traceability applications of \\nfood manufacturing SME' was added to the LFM, with measurable indicator, verification tool \\nand assumption. \\n \\n4.2. Results of the Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) for Turkish \\nfood quality assurance schemes \\nFor the construction of a Logical Framework Matrix (LFM), it is essential to list the main \\nissues of the subject of interest. Therefore, a problem list was prepared based on the findings \\nof the SWOT analysis. All weaknesses and potential threats were discussed and reduced to \\neleven important problems as indicated below: \\n \\nProblem List: \\n1. Lack of quality awareness both on the producer and consumer side \\n2. Export problems due to quality problems \\n3. Lack of coordination and communication between different entities \\n4. Insufficient and inappropriate quality certification and labelling audits \\n5. The quality certification takes time and is expensive (brand, geographical indications \\n(GIs), organic logo, ITU (GAP), etc.). Lack of implementation and auditing after \\ncertification, especially for GI\\u2019s \\n6. Financial weaknesses of SMEs and agricultural holdings \\n7. Lack of awareness about national and international quality applications \\n8. Lack of incentives for quality in production (e.g. GIs)  \\n9. Lack of institutional capacity e.g. R&D (academia, governmental bodies and private \\nsector)  \\n10. Marketing and advertisements are not sufficient even for the products that have a high \\nchance to compete \\n11. Overlapping of legislation among different implementation authorities \\n \\nAs a prerequisite, bureaucracy and low level of income have not been taken into consideration \\nin the problem analysis since it is not possible to approach these problems in this framework. \\n \\n4.2.1. Cause-effect relation \\nThe problems were evaluated by participants to detect the main problem and the interaction \\nbetween problems. Consequently, some problems were found to be the cause or effect of \\n 42\\nothers. Finally, one main and six minor problems were identified. Furthermore, some changes \\nwere made to the description of problems. \\n \\nTable 13: Cause-effect relation of main and related problems \\nMain Problem \\n1. Lack of quality awareness of the producer and the consumer \\nCause: Lack of familiarity with national and international quality application procedures (quality management systems, EU \\nfood quality systems [TSG, PDO and PGI], guarantee brands [e.g. wool mark] and others.) \\nEffect: Low interest in food quality assurance \\nSolution: Improving the food quality awareness level of the producer, consumer and important actors in the food chain.  \\n \\nMinor Problems Cause: Solution: \\n1. Difficulties in exports due to quality \\nproblems \\n \\nLack of information, experience, \\ntechnology, training of producers  \\nSupporting organisational structure and \\ntechnology use, designing training \\nprogrammes  \\n2. Conflict in legislation (overlapping) \\n \\nGaps and overlapping in distribution of \\nduties and responsibilities between \\ninstitutions  \\nThe authority and responsibilities of \\nthe bodies should be reviewed in this \\nrespect \\n3. Lack of trust in quality certification \\naudits and labelling  \\n \\nLack of resources (technical, human \\nresources, motivation), lack of \\ninternationally recognised certification \\nsystem and accreditation \\nSupplying the required equipments to \\nthe auditors, training of more experts, \\nincreasing the budget and extend \\naccreditation efforts \\n4. Financial weaknesses in SMEs and \\nagricultural holdings \\n \\nBudget constraints, traditional \\nmanagement methods, certification of \\nquality (branding, GIs, ITU, organic \\nlogo etc.) is not affordable (costly and \\ntakes long) \\nClustering (unit and top organisation), \\nto facilitate credit for small scale firms \\nand grants from international financial \\nsources  \\n5. Lack of incentives towards quality \\nproduction and products (e.g. GIs) and \\nlack of implementation after the \\ncertification process \\n \\nLack of organisation on producer level \\nand cooperation in the marketing \\nchain, institutional R&D etc., low \\ninterest (academia, governmental \\nbodies, private sector), lack of \\nagricultural support schemes  \\nDesigning agricultural support to \\nstimulate quality production, \\nsupporting marketing of competitive \\nproducts and product advertisements \\n6. Lack of coordination among actors \\nin the food chain \\n \\nLack of coordination and cooperation \\namong institutions and key \\nstakeholders in the food chain \\nImprove coordination among different \\nkey sector stakeholders and increase \\nthe number of audits by authorized \\nbodies \\n \\n4.2.2. Problem tree  \\nIn the procedure to construct the final LFM, it was agreed that a problem tree could be useful. \\nThis problem tree would identify the problem the participatory group considered the most \\ncritical. In addition, there is also the identification of the other concerns associated with the \\nmain problem and the hierarchical structure. The schema highlights the cause-effect \\nrelationship between all the discussed issues. \\n \\n 43\\n \\nFigure 4: Problem tree \\n \\n4.2.3. Logical Framework Matrix (LFM): food quality assurance schemes in Turkey \\nFinally, the LFM was developed using the results of the previous evaluations. As indicated \\nbefore 'a lack of quality awareness of consumers and producers' was agreed as the central \\nproblem requiring solutions. The approach accessed possibilities to overcome specific \\nobjectives, and these were spelled out and specific measures attached. In addition assumptions \\nwere made which support the overall process but are not always directly linked to food \\nquality assurance schemes in Turkey. \\n \\nDirection \\nLack of quality awareness of \\nthe producer and the consumer \\nConflict in legislation \\n(overlapping) \\nFinancial weaknesses in SMEs \\nand agricultural holdings  \\nLack of trust in quality \\ncertification audits and \\nlabelling \\nDifficulties in exports \\ndue to quality problems  \\nLack of coordination \\namong actors in the food \\nchain \\nLack of incentives towards \\nquality production and \\nproducts \\nGaps and overlapping \\nin distribution of duties \\nand responsibilities \\nbetween institutions  \\nLack of information, \\nexperience, \\ntechnology, training of \\nproducers \\nLack of familiarity \\nwith the national \\nand international \\nquality application \\nprocedures \\nBudget constraints, \\ntraditional management \\nmethods, certification of \\nquality is not affordable  \\nLack of organisation in producer \\nlevel and cooperation in the \\nmarketing chain, institutional \\nR&D etc, low interest, lack of \\nagricultural support scheme \\nLack of coordination and \\ncooperation among \\ninstitutions and key \\nstakeholders in the food \\nchain \\nLack of resources, lack \\nof internationally \\nrecognised certification \\nsystem and accreditation \\nLow interest in food \\nquality assurance  \\nMain Problem \\nCause Effect \\n 44 \\nTable 14: Logical Framework Matrix: food quality assurance schemes in Turkey \\nOverall objectives Measurable indicators  Verification tools Assumptions \\n1. overcome quality problems in exports  \\n2. minimize legislative problems among \\ninstitutions \\n3. avoid incapable and unreliable quality \\ncertification audits and labelling \\n4. provide financial support to SMEs and \\nagricultural holdings for quality assurance \\n5. improve incentives for quality production \\nand products (e.g. PGI, Quality brand) and \\nimprove performances and increase frequency \\nof audits after certification \\n6. support coordination and collaboration \\namong the actors in the food chain \\n \\n \\n * EU accession period will not be interrupted \\nand adaptation of the legislation will be \\ncompleted \\n \\n* Infrastructure investments about improving \\nfood quality assurance systems will be sustained \\nby TKB and related institutions in order to fulfil \\nmarket demands. \\n \\n* The improvement of the quality assurance and \\ntraceability system will be sustained according \\nto the requirements of the export market. \\nSpecific objectives Measurable indicators Verification tools Assumptions \\n1. increase consumers\\u2019 quality awareness \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2. inform and provide examples to \\nproducers, related institutions and other actors \\nin the supply chain about successful quality \\napplications \\n1.1. attract the interest of the mass media on \\nfood quality by organising meetings with \\njournalists, making special TV programmes on \\nnational TV channels, organising campaigns \\nand increasing primary school students' \\nawareness of food quality \\n1.2. increase transparency of production in \\nmanufacturing plants to consumers \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2.1. organise quality management courses for \\nthe producer organisations and related \\nstakeholders \\n2.2 organise working trips to stakeholders in EU \\ncountries \\n \\n1.1. increase in number of news items in the \\nmedia, increasing number and duration of \\nprograms in TV channels and distributing \\nleaflets to primary level students for education \\nabout food quality \\n1.2. concept, content, time and frequency of \\norganised campaigns \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2.1. number of workshops organised for \\nproducer organisations and other important \\nshareholders and number attendees  \\n2.2 demonstrate success stories in EU countries \\non-site to important stakeholders, number of \\ncountries (cases) visited and number of people \\nattending \\n1.1.

Farmers\\u2019 knowledge, perception and interests about \\nfood quality assurance schemes: Rapid Rural Appraisal \\n(RRA) results \\nInformation and socio-economic data on producers of selected agricultural products were \\nobtained using the Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) method. The data were analysed in order to \\nexplore the current status of food quality assurance practices, awareness, knowledge and \\nperception of local stakeholders. To serve this purpose, nine products and twelve regions were \\nselected (Figure 5; Table 15). In each selected region, interviews were arranged with \\nimportant regional and/or local stakeholders and a representative village (or town), with \\nrespect to the overall region was determined during the interviews with key stakeholders such \\nas the provincial agricultural directorate or producers\\u2019 organisations. The RRA was conducted \\nwith producers\\u2019 panels composed of at least 8-10 participants. The demographic structure of \\nthe villages and the farm households, improvements and investments in production techniques \\nand progress in product quality were addressed. A semi-structured questionnaire (See Annex \\nA) was prepared to obtain basic descriptive information and data related to the main aims \\nmentioned above. In the first part of the questionnaire, questions on the demographic structure \\nof the selected villages and the economic situation of the producers were asked. The questions \\nof the second part aimed to explore the knowledge of the producers about their product and its \\nquality as well as the producers\\u2019 interest in quality issues and their expectations for \\nimprovements of their product quality in the near future. The RRA study regions were \\nselected according to the importance of the products in terms of production volume in \\nnational agriculture and/or the reputation of the region for the respective products. Interviews \\naimed to obtain information on the production process, farm structure, developments in terms \\nof food quality and safety, recent production and trade data on representative production \\nregions in the province and/or sub-province. Moreover, the key food players were informed \\nabout the FQAS-TURK project and they were invited to the workshop in Ankara where they \\nwould be able to share their knowledge and opinions for completing the Logical Framework \\nMatrix (LFM) analysis. \\n \\n \\nFigure 5: Map of RRA studies in Turkey \\n \\n 47\\nTable 15: Selected areas and their importance in Turkish agricultural \\nProduct Province (sub-province) Description \\nBeef Afyonkarahisar 5.3 % of national registered cattle and buffalo meat in 2005, \\nrespectively; two meat products have a GI certificate  \\nOlive and olive oil  Bal\\u0131kesir (Ayvalik) Recent data indicates 9 million olive trees, 173 000 tons \\nproduction and 71 000 hectares; there is also olive oil certified \\nwith GI \\nTomato Antalya (Kumluca) 20 % of national production and more than 50 % of greenhouse \\nproduction and exports \\nApple Isparta (Egirdir) 25 % of national production \\nGrape and Raisin Manisa (Alasehir) 30 % of grape production and more than 50 % of raisin \\nproduction  \\nDried Fig Ayd\\u0131n 60% of national production   \\nDried Apricot Malatya More than 90% of national production \\nCitrus Antalya (Finike) Important production location and export points, including Finike \\nOrange with GI certification \\nCitrus Mersin Important production location and export points \\nMilk Afyonkarahisar 2.6 % of national milk production in 2005 \\nMilk Burdur 1.7 % of national milk production in 2005 \\nMilk Konya & Karaman About 5 % of national milk production in 2005; including a local \\ncheese with GI certification \\n \\nIn light of the information obtained from the interviews with key local stakeholders, the semi-\\nstructured survey was conducted in the most representative and/or popular production sites of \\nthe selected province or sub-province. The producers of the selected products in villages were \\ninvited to a round table discussion at the Village Headman House or Village Caf\\u00e9 and the \\nRRA study was carried out by filling in the form during conversations with the group. Each \\nsemi-structured completed questionnaire form in the selected areas (RRA Instrument) is \\nsummarized with the additional information obtained about the location and the products from \\nkey stakeholders during the interview.  \\n \\n5.1. RRA study reports  \\n5.1.1. Afyonkarahisar \\u2013 milk and beef \\nAfyonkarahisar plays a major supply role in beef and veal, meat products and milk (including \\nwater buffalo milk). According to the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture, the number of \\ncattle was 283 979 and of water buffalo was 2 532 in 2007. The 2007 production was 259 676 \\ntons of milk and 20 522 tons of meat (including beef, veal and sheep) and the number of cattle \\nand sheep slaughtered were 88 796 and 17 841 respectively. The total milk production of \\nAfyonkarahisar contributed 2% to the national production. There were 34 milk production \\nplants, of which 24 had applied for milk incentive premiums and were supported for around \\n59 275 tons of milk by the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture in 2007. Approximately 23% \\nof the milk produced was marketed by plants that comply with the minimum required \\ntechnical standards (i.e. hygiene, quality control etc.), the primary requirement to be \\nsupported. \\n \\nThe registered annual production in 2007 equated to 2 366 tons sucuk (Turkish type sausage), \\n832 tons sausage, 369 tons salami, 94 tons pastrami (dried meat), 126 tons kebab, 297 tons \\nkavurma (roasted meat), 27 tons ham, and 2.4 tons burger meat. \\n \\nAs of 24 November 2008, there were 137 308 registered cattle; of which 42 772 were \\nattributed to the pedigree system (including 20 278 cows) and 94 536 to the pre-pedigree \\nsystem (including 60 956 cows and 14 820 bulls). 2 112 farmers (4 cooperatives and 5 private \\ncompanies) were registered to the pedigree system and 24 745 (8 cooperatives and 5 private \\n 48\\ncompanies) to the pre-pedigree system. According to these figures, each farmer had an \\naverage of 20.3 cattle of which 16.6 were cows. \\n \\nThere was no application for organic farming and GAP (good agricultural practices) for \\nanimal breeding. However, organic fruits, flowers and other vegetables were grown on around \\n328 ha by 296 different producers. \\n \\nAfyonkarahisar Chamber of Commerce has three GI certificates for Afyon Sucuk, Afyon \\nPastrami and Afyon Milk Cream. A supervision team has been formed and a hologram has \\nbeen designed for meat products (especially for sucuk). Managers that were contacted have \\nclaimed that the leading firm-brands in the region like Cumhuriyet, \\u0130kbal, \\u0130pek do not \\nvolunteer for use of this hologram as they mostly believe that their brand is much better \\nknown than the GI hologram. Another reason is the lack of traceability of those firms that use \\nthis hologram. However, this may still be an incentive for some SMEs which could not \\nachieve to be a brand. \\n \\nIn the province, an association (ASEMSU) was formed in 2006 to bring together producers in \\nthe area and it currently has 20 members. ASEMSU prepared educational panels to instruct \\nand train for hygiene, ISO-22000 and HACCP.  \\n \\nRRA (Susuz village) \\nSusuz is 15 km from Afyonkarahisar with around 1 000 households and a population of \\n6 000; the majority work for the government and local industries. The major products are \\nwheat, barley and clover for feed, milk and cattle. The producers market the cereals to the \\nflour and feed factories in Afyonkarahisar, milk to local dairy plants (via mobile milk \\ncollectors) and beef cattle to the meat processing plants. An irrigation cooperative is present \\nin the village and, in addition, there are 23 farmers registered in the 'Cattle Breeders' \\nAssociation' (CBA) in Afyonkarahisar. This association does not perform any activity for \\nmarketing milk products but helps producers in terms of veterinary services, artificial \\ninseminations, feed supplements and marketing of breeding cattle. The annual income of an \\naverage household is around 7 000 TL of which 70-80% originates from agriculture.  \\n \\nProducers use the words 'hygiene' or 'healthy products' when defining the term 'food quality'. \\nTheir basic information is obtained from the nationwide milk plant veterinarians. \\n \\nThey do not have organic farming in the village, but are partly aware of it. The farmers are \\nnot informed about Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and GIs and there is also no intention \\nof carrying out organic production or GAP. \\n \\nThe average number of dairy cows in the village is about 10, and 23 farmers have more than \\n10 cows and 100 of them less than 10. Around 70 farmers are specialised in beef cattle with \\nan average of 10 animals and the average land for producing corn and/or clover for feed is \\naround 1 ha. \\n \\nIt has been observed that during the last decade the number of dairy cattle increased. \\nMoreover, farmers without tractors have left agricultural production. There is an improvement \\nin production technologies (artificial insemination, machinery, veterinary services, and \\nefficient milk production) and an increase in production of milk that fulfils the Turkish codex \\nrequirements. However, the intention to increase the quality of production is not significant \\nbecause of the increase in production costs. There is also a decrease in the net profit from \\n 49\\nagricultural products (meat and milk) basically due to input prices that increase more so than \\nthe output prices (milk price versus feed costs and veterinary services). \\n \\nThe advantages of producers are their closeness to the market and cheap manpower whereas \\nthe disadvantages are the lack of water and pasture areas.  \\n \\nFarmers have been investing in barns, machinery for silage and milking; more than 50% \\nalready have milking machines. The basic source of investment capital is from their own \\nsources. \\n \\nRRA (K\\u00fc\\u00e7\\u00fck\\u00e7obanl\\u0131 Village) \\nThe village has 85 households and the population is around 750. The major income sources \\nare animal breeding (water buffalo, dairy cattle and beef cattle) and vegetable production. \\nProducers sell the wheat to flour plants and barley to feed plants. Milk from water buffalo is \\nused for milk cream and the remaining part is used for a special type of filtered yogurt that is \\nmarketed in Afyonkarahisar. The milk is sold to regional collectors and sometimes to \\nnationwide plants. Beef cattle for meat are sold to regional plants. Villagers place their annual \\nincome at around 8 000-10 000 TL per household. The agricultural development cooperative \\nhas 30 members; the irrigation cooperative has 47 members in the village. The majority of \\nfarm households earn all their income (100%) from agricultural activities. Around 15 people \\nwork in Afyonkarahisar and commute on a daily basis. \\n \\nThe major understanding of food quality is hygiene. The special product of the region is milk \\ncream from water buffalo milk as the region is geographically suitable for water buffalo. The \\nproducers' association is looking for alternatives to build a milk cream production plant for \\nthe village and looking for support from the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and \\nuniversity. The price of water buffalo milk is double the price of cow milk and it is generally \\nused for yoghurt or milk cream production. The quality of milk cream cannot be audited and a \\npure product is rarely found (often mixed with cow\\u2019s milk). \\n \\nOrganic agriculture is understood to refer to production without fertilizers and pesticides. \\nFarmers have no information about GAP, and no intention of farming organically. Farmers \\nhave heard about the GI of Afyon Sucuk and Pastrami but are not aware what this means \\nexactly nor of its potential advantages. There are about 80 farmers that own at least 20 beef \\ncattle and the production method is in open pasture and barns. \\n \\nLarge breeding plants in Afyonkarahisar \\nCo\\u015fkun Meat and Products Inc. \\nThe firm has two modern farms in Istanbul and Afyonkarahisar (founded in 2003) with a \\ncapacity for around 5 500 cattle and it currently has around 3 800 animals (600 water buffalo \\nand the rest beef cattle). There are 2 500 water buffalo in the Istanbul farms, 36 workers are \\npresent on the farm with full automation. The barns have concrete floors and are very clean. \\nThey have no own feed production. All feed for animals is packed and stored in separate \\nstores. Entrance is restricted and the firm obtained ISO 22000 (in 2008) and also an ISO 9001 \\ncertificate. \\n \\nPlants producing meat products (\\u0130kbal and Cumhuriyet)  \\n\\u0130kbal Meat Products Industry was founded in 1990. The name comes from a famous city \\nrestaurant founded in 1922. The plant has a slaughtering capacity of 500-600 cattle per month \\naround 30% of this figure are water buffalo. \\n 50\\n \\nThe net meat weight of the slaughtered cattle, water buffalo and dairy cow are around 300, \\n230 and 300 kg respectively. Meat is sold fresh and used for processed meat such as sucuk, \\nsausages, pastrami, salami, ham, kebab, meat burgers and roasted meat. Fresh meat is sold to \\nhotel chains and also to grocery shops that the plant owns in Istanbul. \\u0130kbal has a franchising \\nsystem, with around 27 restaurants and basically selling cooked meals, kebabs and a famous \\nAfyon kaymakl\\u0131 kaday\\u0131f (a kind of dessert made from stale bread, sugar syrup and served \\nwith milk cream from the region). The firm has ISO 9001, HACCP (since 2004) and \\nISO 22000 (since 2007). \\u0130kbal mainly considers the age, weight, registration (of the animal) \\nand appearance of the cattle before purchasing and slaughtering. The firm employs \\nveterinarians and food engineers, and live animal suppliers are evenly shared between large \\nfirms and small farmers. The firm does not sell bulk meat and has a plan to construct a plant \\nwith a capacity of around 1 500 tons of meat/month. Nationwide marketing chains sell the \\nfirm's products. \\n \\nCumhuriyet Meat Products Industry was founded in 1928 as a small producer and opened the \\ncurrent modern plant in 2005. On average 200 cattle are processed per day but the capacity is \\naround 500. The processed meat products are sucuk, pastrami and fresh meat. The firm has \\nvendors in many cities and it owns a big restaurant near a major highway and in \\nAfyonkarahisar. Meat products are sold in all major marketing chains nationwide such as \\nMigros, Tan\\u015fa\\u015f, Kiler, Real and Metro, and fresh meat is also sold to traders in Istanbul. The \\nfirm does not have HACCP and ISO 22000 but has applied for certification. Marketing chains \\nlike Migros and Real audit the firm on a periodic basis and the firm is trusted for its brand \\nname. \\n \\n5.1.2. Bal\\u0131kesir (Ayval\\u0131k) \\u2013 olives and olive oil \\nAyval\\u0131k is located south of Edremit Bay in the Balikesir province of the Aegean region. The \\nmain source of income is domestic tourism and olives/olive oils. There are approximately \\n4 800 olive producers with 1 800 000 olive trees on 16 000 ha. Only around 1% of the \\nproducers have more than 1 000 olive trees. Olives can be picked intensively in two years; the \\nyields of two successive years are approximately 50-60 kg/tree and 12 kg/tree, respectively. \\nAbout 95% of the olives are used for oil and the rest is for direct consumption. On average, \\nthe oil yield is 1 kg of oil from 7 kg olives but sometimes it could increase to 1 kg of oil from \\n5 kg olives as occurred in 2008. \\n \\nThe main problems are olive moth and olive fly. Until the ban in 2006, TKB used pesticides \\nsprayed from the air for the olive fly on all trees in the region. To protect olives from the \\nmoth, producers use pesticides during the development of the fruit. Another problem of the \\nregion is sloped terrain (more than 80%) which results in short and small olive trees and \\nreduces the possibility of irrigation. However, trees on flat land, from which the olives are \\nused as table olives, are irrigated by a drip system. \\n \\nAyval\\u0131k Chamber of Commerce (CoC) obtained the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) \\ncertification for olive oil in the Ayval\\u0131k region in 2007 following a costly four year procedure. \\nIn addition, TAR\\u0130\\u015e also holds a PDO certificate, covering an area from \\u00c7anakkale to \\u0130zmir \\nincluding Ayval\\u0131k. In the Ayval\\u0131k region, the CoC has been actively promoting the use of the \\nPDO. Firms have to apply to the CoC for the use of PDO holograms and products should pass \\nannual chemical and sensory analyses carried out by eight experts. To qualify, experts must \\n 51\\nbe trained by the 'Olive Friends Association'. In 2008, 15 different plants applied for the use \\nof PDO holograms and 14 of them were approved. \\n \\nAlthough there are transaction costs for obtaining the PDO certificate and producing in \\naccordance with the norms, firms cannot sell their products at a premium price. Therefore, the \\nuse of PDO holograms is only to gain consumer confidence and strengthen the brand's name. \\nThe CoC also organises a harvesting fair each year, where tasting panels and other activities \\nare carried out to advertise the Ayval\\u0131k olive oil brand and support the olive oil market. \\n \\nRRA (Ak\\u00e7ap\\u0131nar village) \\nAk\\u00e7ap\\u0131nar is a mountain village in the Ayval\\u0131k district with 500 households and a population \\nof 1 200. The main source of income is olives for olive oil production, with a few trees \\nplanted recently for table olive production. In addition, goats are raised for own consumption \\nand okra is also cultivated as a cash crop. Olives are sold to the cooperative\\u2019s plant (TAR\\u0130\\u015e) \\nor nearby merchants or olive oil plants. TAR\\u0130\\u015e belongs to an agricultural marketing \\ncooperative in the village with 100 members, with activities on olive marketing and providing \\nan advance payment in the form of a credit of around 3 000 TL per ton, based on the average \\nquantity of the olive oil delivered to TAR\\u0130\\u015e in the last 3 years. The annual income of a \\nhousehold exclusively from agricultural activity is around 6 000 TL. Farmers also work as \\nlabourers in the olive gardens of the olive oil factories and merchants. In employment women \\nnormally earn 50% less than men. \\n \\nThe acid content of the olive oil is described as the food quality in olive oil by the producers. \\nThe difference of this region's olive oil is claimed to be due to climate and soil composition. \\nTherefore, olives grown in the Ayval\\u0131k region yield more mature olives and give more oil. \\nFarmers have no idea how to distinguish their products from others, and claim that olives and \\nolive oil have been transferred to Ayval\\u0131k from other regions (like Ayd\\u0131n), processed in \\nAyval\\u0131k and marketed as Ayval\\u0131k olive oil. Ayvalik farmers also claim that their product is \\nsuperior in terms of acidity, taste, shelf-life and colour among its competitors. \\n \\nProduction without using chemical fertilizers is described as organic farming; farmers have no \\nknowledge about GAP and have not heard of geographical indications. There is no organic \\nfarming or GAP applied in the region. \\n \\nThere are around 450 producers with on average 1 ha each; only 10 have more than 5 ha and \\n45 less than 1 ha of land. Intermediate-dwarf trees are used for common production. \\n \\nProducers claim that the average land owned by producers has been increasing during the last \\ndecade. Some farmers have invested in drip irrigation systems, use new pesticide management \\nsystems and plant different kinds of olive trees. In recent years, new pruning methods, \\nexpansion of irrigation and efficient use of pesticides caused an improvement in the olive oil \\nquality. Profits from olive production have declined due to inflation, an increase in input \\ncosts, a decrease in selling prices and droughts. With regards to input costs, the price of \\npesticides and fertilizers in particular has increased and therefore the application has been \\nreduced. Another important increase in input cost is due to rising diesel prices.  \\n \\nAdvantages of Ayval\\u0131k olive oil production are: proximity to the seaside (climate), soil (with \\nclay), workforce and experience, whereas disadvantages include lack of irrigation facilities, \\norganisational weaknesses, sloped land and small farm size. \\n \\n 52\\nProducers invested in forming new olive orchards (at a cost of 250 TL/ha) and purchasing \\nautomatic machines for pesticides (15 000 TL/ha), where 50% of the machine is given as aid \\nby TKB to the farmers. \\n \\n5.1.3. Antalya (Kumluca) \\u2013 tomatoes \\nKumluca in the Antalya province is the leader in greenhouse production of tomatoes in \\nTurkey. Tomatoes are produced in 24 villages and 3 small towns belonging to Kumluca on \\n3 700 ha in greenhouses (plastic and glass covered). Around 7 500 farmers deal with \\ngreenhouse production. The overall population of Kumluca is of 70 000, of which 12 500 are \\nfarmers. In addition, green peppers and eggplants are also produced in greenhouses in the \\nregion. In Antalya province 1.7 million tons of tomatoes are produced and Kumluca \\ncontributes 600 000 tons, around 40% of the total for export. This has also supported the \\ndevelopment of related industries in the region, such as 104 pesticide suppliers, 13 seedling \\nproduction plants and 3 different wholesale markets, which are very busy in export seasons. \\n \\nGreenhouse production began in the 1980s and it has expanded to cover almost the entire \\nKumluca Valley. The region outside the Kumluca Valley does not produce tomatoes, \\ntherefore other vegetables like eggplants, peppers and fruits (citrus and pomegranate) are \\nproduced in these areas. \\n \\nThe main factor affecting production is the considerable age of the greenhouses, which \\nincreases the risk of viruses and thus requires the use of more pesticides. On the other hand, \\nthe experience (know-how) gained over 30 years and the well-developed marketing structure \\nare the main advantages. \\n \\nRRA (Sar\\u0131casu village) \\nThe village has 1 000 households and 3 500 people and is linked to the central town of the \\nKumluca region. The main source of income is greenhouse production (the majority being \\ntomatoes, followed by eggplants and peppers) and 60% of fresh tomatoes are exported. There \\nis no active producers\\u2019 cooperative or organisation. The producers\\u2019 association and chamber \\nof agriculture are present in the district centre but not very active in nearby villages. The \\naverage annual income of a household is around 10 000 TL, almost entirely from agriculture. \\nIn addition, a few people work in packaging plants in the export season or have small village \\ngroceries. \\n \\nHygiene and products without pesticide residues are the main aspects understood in terms of \\nfood quality. Products of this region (especially tomatoes) are believed to be different from \\nother regions due to the climate. Using the \\u2018region name\\u2019 on the packaging material is \\nbelieved to differentiate from other products. Moreover, tomatoes from nearby regions like \\nSerik and Demre are claimed to be marketed as Kumluca tomatoes. Tomatoes produced in \\nKumluca are distinct in size, smell and taste. \\n \\nFarmers perceive organic farming as pesticide-free production and some confuse it with \\nagriculture without soil. Farmers have no information about GAP or GIs, although nearby \\nFinike Oranges are known to them as GIs. There is no interest in organic farming or in GAP \\nin the region but some large producers are farming without soil (hydroponic). They have \\naccepted systems and technologies but the costs are too high for them to cover. The average \\nsize of greenhouse production is about 0.4 ha. \\n \\n 53\\nProducers reported that the average greenhouse size has been increasing recently due to large \\nproducers entering the market. Some small producers have left the sector as a result of \\ndifficulties with repayments to bank creditors and other agents. Production technologies used \\nhave been improved, for example building high tunnel greenhouses, high air ventilation \\nsystems, using seedlings and Bambus bee nets. In addition, the use of vaccinated seeds \\n(resistance to diseases) and greenhouses with high air ventilation systems (reducing the need \\nfor pesticides) also increase product quality. Net profit is lowering due to inflation and high \\ninput costs and the constant sale price of the final product. \\n \\nThe advantages are the climate, soil composition and experience whereas the disadvantages \\nare disease and low resistance of the soil to diseases.   \\n \\nProducers have invested in greenhouse renewal (air ventilation systems, ventilation, drip \\nirrigation systems, using seedling and grafted seeding etc). Investment costs for a new \\ngreenhouse is around 150 000-200 000 TL/ha. The capital investment is generally financed \\nwith bank credits. The capital for seedling and other inputs are supplied by the Agricultural \\nCredit Cooperatives. If they need fixed term payments they may choose pesticide dealers and \\nfor cash advances they can obtain the money from agents in the wholesale market. \\n \\n5.1.4. Isparta (E\\u011firdir) \\u2013 apples \\nThe annual apple production of Turkey is around 2.5 million tons from a total of 34.5 million \\ntrees and Isparta has a share of around 12.5% in terms of apple trees and 20% in terms of \\napple production. In the E\\u011firdir district (sub-province), the cold-storage capacity is around \\n130 000 tons/year and most of them do not have controlled-atmosphere storage facilities. \\nHowever, there is a constant increase in the number of cold-storage houses with controlled-\\natmosphere and sorting/packaging units. As an example, in E\\u011firdir, the Agricultural \\nDevelopment Cooperatives have such cold-storage houses with a capacity of almost 50 000 \\ntons/year. \\n \\nThe districts growing apples are E\\u011firdir, Gelendost and Senirkent. E\\u011firdir produces 50% \\nmore than the others. The main varieties are Starking and Golden (around 85-90% of the \\norchards). There are no attempts at organic production or GIs but in some villages there are \\nGlobalGAP applications.  \\n \\nThe average age of apple orchards in E\\u011firdir is more than 35 years, meaning they are towards \\nthe end of their economic life cycle. The average size of farms is 1-1.5 ha. New organisations, \\nlike Agricultural Developing Cooperatives, have been emerging in the region and started to \\nplay an important role in marketing. The formation of cooperatives is concentrated in villages \\nbetween the two lakes, E\\u011firdir and Kovada, (namely Serpil, Tepeli, Akdogan, Yukar\\u0131 \\nG\\u00f6kdere, A\\u011f\\u0131lk\\u00f6y, Ey\\u00fcpler, Yuval\\u0131 and Balk\\u0131r\\u0131) which specialise in producing apples. In each \\nof the 8 villages there is a cooperative, with in total 1 417 members. There are cold-storage \\nhouses in each village with a total capacity of 38 000 tons and 5 villages also have \\nsorting/packaging units. In addition, some cooperatives have invested in common drip \\nirrigation systems for their apple orchards and are investigating technological opportunities \\nfor quality improvements. Cooperatives are working with wholesale agents and those with \\nsorting and packaging facilities directly serve nationwide marketing chains like CarrefourSA, \\nReal, Diasa and Tesco-Kipa. \\n \\n \\n 54\\nRRA (Ey\\u00fcpler village) \\nEy\\u00fcpler village in E\\u011firdir consists of 85 households and 310 people, with a high percentage of \\nincomes derived from apple growing (90%). Some farm households also have cherry and \\npeach trees and very few breed goats. Apple varieties are generally Starking (60%) and \\nGolden (40%). Products unsuitable for storage are sold to the close by fruit juice plants. The \\nremaining part is stored and served to local markets. The Agricultural Development \\nCooperative in the village has 39 members and has a 5 000 ton capacity of cold-storage \\nrooms. The marketing of stored apples is usually carried out by the cooperative. The average \\nannual household income is around 12 000 TL, all earned from agricultural activities, \\nparticularly apple growing. Some young inhabitants also work in fruit juice plants during the \\nseasonal harvesting periods. \\n \\nProducers understand hygiene and product standards as food quality. Apples are the special \\nproduct of the region where the basic characteristics are due to the microclimate in the valley \\nbetween two lakes and two mountain ridges. Apple cultivation started during the 1960s in the \\nregion and it is now one of the leading areas. Producers have not made attempts to distinguish \\nany characteristic features of their products due to bulk marketing. Besides, they claim that \\napples from other parts of Turkey (e.g. Mara\\u015f apples) are brought to this region to be \\nmarketed as E\\u011firdir apples. Producers have also reported that apples produced in Ey\\u00fcpler are \\nsuperior in terms of taste, acidity and appearance (shiny, oblong). \\n \\nOrganic farming is perceived by farmers as growing apples without using chemicals and \\nfertilizers. Experience with GlobalGAP (formerly EurepGAP) started two years ago with \\ngovernorship support but ended as no price premium was obtained. Producers are not aware \\nof GIs and claimed that GlobalGAP (or GAP applications) can be retried in the village if it is \\nprofitable. They are also attempting to establish traceability systems for their products by \\nusing software with the support of the District Directorate of Agriculture in E\\u011firdir. Producers \\nbelieve that these kinds of systems can result in a decrease in production costs. \\n \\nThere are 130 producers with an average of 1.5 ha farm area in Ey\\u00fcpler. Among these, 10 \\nhave more than 5 ha, 30 between 2 ha and 5 ha and 15 with less than 1 ha. Drip irrigation \\nsystems are common in all orchards and trees are generally half-dwarf conventional varieties. \\n \\nDuring the last decade, the scale of apple farms has not changed much. Recent developments \\ninclude establishing new cold-storage rooms, drip irrigation systems and using tractors in \\nfarming. In addition, some production techniques, like fruit thinning methods, are also \\nexperimented with to increase the product quality. Producers' organisations in the form of \\ncooperatives have increased in importance. Net profits are lowered mainly due to inflation \\nand input costs (fertilizers and others).  \\n \\nThe advantages in apple production are climate, water and closeness to processing plants and \\ndisadvantages are humidity, frequent precipitation and soil composition. \\n \\nFarmers have been supported in investments in establishing irrigation systems (4 500 TL/ha- \\n45% subsidy), replanting apple orchards (20 000 TL/ha-50% subsidy), constructing cold \\nstorage rooms (bank credits) and fencing for wild animals (50% governor subsidy). \\n \\n 55\\n5.1.5. Manisa (Ala\\u015fehir) \\u2013 grapes and raisins \\nAla\\u015fehir is a district in the province of Manisa and is one of the main areas where seedless \\ngrapes are grown. According to the information gathered from Ala\\u015fehir Directorate of \\nAgriculture, there are 19 500 ha of vineyards in the areas giving a total of 2 250 000 tons of \\nfresh grapes. Around 316 000 tons of raisins are produced from some of these fresh grapes \\nand 250 000 tons of the raisins are exported. The conversion rate is 1 ton of raisins obtained \\nfrom 4.5-5 tons of fresh grapes. Around 65-70% of the grapes are used for the raisin \\nproduction and the rest is marketed as fresh and also used in wine or alcohol production.  \\n \\nThe main source of income in 30 of the 65 villages located in the district is grape production. \\nA total of 5 000 producers farm on vineyards of an average of around 1 ha. The yield is \\naround 30 tons/ha. In a well designed vineyard it has been reported that yields can be \\nincreased to around 100 tons/ha by using modern techniques like high trellis systems and by \\ndrip irrigation systems (however only about 15% of the total production area uses this type of \\nirrigation). \\n \\nThere are around 50 packaging and processing plants for exports. Firms focusing on fresh \\ngrape exports have been building plants in this region since 2000 and they also use their \\npackaging units for other products, like strawberries, cherries etc., produced in this region.  \\n \\nAccording to the interview with TAR\\u0130\\u015e officials in the district, the main quality problem in \\ngrape production is pesticide residues. A pesticide laboratory with nine workers has been set \\nup with the support of Ala\\u015fehir Mercantile Exchange and Intertek (an international firm). The \\naflatoxin problem is not a common problem unless it rains heavily during the growing season. \\nFarmers are trained by agricultural engineers to overcome the problem. Moreover, farmers are \\ncurious about the effects of cyanide used in gold mine processes on the quality of grapes. \\n \\nRecently, there has been no governmental support to grape production. However, during the \\n1970s the construction of concrete platforms for raisin drying was supported, and some of \\nthem are still in use. Nowadays, new multi-storey fenced drying systems increase the raisin \\nquality but their construction is not supported. The interest in grape production is increasing \\nin neighbouring Buldan (Denizli). \\n \\nThe storage of raisins can be extended to two years in a controlled atmosphere provided that \\nthe pre-drying is done correctly. The largest storage house belongs to the TAR\\u0130\\u015e cooperative \\nwhere members\\u2019 average vineyard size is around 1.6 ha, higher than the region\\u2019s average. A \\nfamily with four members should have a plot of at least 2 ha live sustainably from grape \\nproduction, therefore it is expected that some small producers may leave production in the \\nnear future.  \\n \\nThere is no organic production in this region but 20% of the producers comply with \\nGlobalGAP with the support of export firms based on contract farming. \\n \\nRRA (Ba\\u011fl\\u0131ca village) \\nBa\\u011fl\\u0131ca village has around 550 households with 1 600 people where all residents\\u2019 main source \\nof income comes from vineyards. Almost 40% of the grapes produced are sent to wineries. \\nThe remainder is seedless white grapes and 85% are marketed as fresh and 10-15% as raisins. \\nThe commercial products of the village are grapes and cattle breeding (performed with the \\nhelp of agricultural development support in 70 farm households). There are Agricultural \\nCredit and Agricultural Development Cooperatives in the village with 400 and 70 members \\n 56\\nrespectively. These cooperatives are not active in the marketing of grapes. The average \\nhousehold income per village resident is 7 000 TL/year, all of which is agricultural income.  \\n \\nProducers understand hygiene and product shape as food quality. The special product of the \\nregion is the seedless white grape. The special differences to other regions are the soil \\ncomposition and low boron content of the water used for irrigation. Farmers also indicated \\nthat a strong producer's association and using the brand name of the association may be \\nbeneficial in terms of differentiating themselves from other regions. Nearby regions sell \\nproducts with reference to the same origin. However, products of the Ala\\u015fehir district are \\nsuperior in terms of taste, appearance (larger) and shelf-life, and can therefore be marketed at \\nabout 50% higher than their rivals. \\n \\nProducers cannot define organic production and have no information about GAP; they have \\nonly heard that large producers apply it. They also have no information or even idea about \\nGIs. There is no land in the region suitable for organic production. Contract farming with \\nlarge customers requires specific production techniques (as for example GAP). Overall all \\nthese systems are seen as opportunities and believed to increase the market share and sale \\nprice. \\n \\nThere are around 400 producers with an average vineyard size of 3 ha. Among these 5-6 \\nproducers have more than 10 ha and 100 have less than 1 ha. The common method of \\nvineyard plantation is building high trellis systems.  \\n \\nThe average size of the vineyards has been decreasing during the last decade and producers \\nhave tended to switch to high trellis systems, drop irrigation and new varieties in recent years. \\nIn addition, covers are increasingly used to prevent rain damage and pesticides are used with \\nthe utmost care to increase quality. TAR\\u0130\\u015e requires a minimum amount of grapes to be \\nhandled in order to grant membership, which reduces the opportunity for coordination among \\nsmaller producers. There is also an increase in the number of merchants and export firms in \\nthe region. There is a loss in net profit due to inflation and increased input costs. \\n \\nThe advantages are climate, soil, groundwater availability and workforce experience, while \\ndisadvantages are lack of coordination and the presence of a gold mine (cyanide use).  \\n \\nRecent investments are installing a high trellis system (50 000 TL/ha) and drip irrigation \\nsystems (5 000 TL/ha) and are mainly financed from personal capital. \\n \\n5.1.6. Ayd\\u0131n \\u2013 figs \\nThe economy of the province of Ayd\\u0131n depends on agriculture and industry. According to the \\ndata and information from Ayd\\u0131n Provincial Directorate of Agriculture, the main agricultural \\nproducts of Ayd\\u0131n are figs, olives (gemlik olives), chestnuts, strawberries, cotton, corn, feed \\ngrass and animal breeding. Though figs are produced almost all over the province the special \\nfigs for sun-drying (yellow-lobe) are produced in the Germencik and Incirliova districts. \\nThere are around 6.5 million fig trees on 39 678.2 ha with 30-40 thousand producers. The \\noverall dried fig production of Turkey is around 45-50 thousand tons, of which around 70% \\nare produced in Ayd\\u0131n. The drying yield is around 1 kg dried figs from 5 kg fresh figs, and \\npre-drying figs are placed on a wire-shelf above the ground where they are left under direct \\nsunlight (called kerevit). Water content is reduced to around 30% during sun-drying and \\nthereafter in processing plants it is further reduced to 20% for final use. Around 95% of dried \\n 57\\nfigs are exported and the rest is sold on the domestic market. Figs are harvested between mid-\\nAugust and mid-September. Processing plants, including 120 large ones, elaborate the \\nproduce (dried figs) until December of the same year.  \\n \\nThe main quality problem in dried figs is aflatoxin due to contamination with soil fungus \\nduring open air drying. Aflatoxin content is periodically checked in exported products but not \\nfor those destined for the domestic market. The Exporters' Association only compensates \\nadditional costs for products containing aflatoxin following pre-checking. According to data \\nin 2008, around 1% of the products are expected to contain aflatoxin. Fig trees are mainly \\ngrown on mountain slopes and no pesticides, or fertilizers are applied, only animal manure. \\nThere is no irrigation system on the slopes; therefore the quality of figs depends on the \\namount of rain. Figs do not grow well enough if the average annual amount of rain is below \\n630 l/m2. Even though the above mentioned method of fig production is very close to organic \\nproduction there are currently no producers licensed for organic production. There is no \\nspecific governmental support for the production or exportation of figs. \\n \\nAyd\\u0131n Chamber of Commerce has the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) for yellow-lobe \\n(Sar\\u0131lop) figs from Ayd\\u0131n; however, its common use has not started yet. TAR\\u0130\\u015e Fig \\nAssociation has planned to use the holograms on its 2008 produce packages. Officials dealing \\nwith the PDO procedures have indicated that the main purpose of obtaining PDO for yellow-\\nlobe (Sar\\u0131lop) figs from Ayd\\u0131n is to prevent unfair competition and to increase profits. The \\nmain characteristics of Ayd\\u0131n figs are their thin skin, sweetness, light colour and shape. Izmir \\nMercantile Exchange has also obtained a PDO for dried figs covering the entire Aegean \\nregion (also including Ayd\\u0131n); however, the PDO is until now not utilised. \\n \\nTAR\\u0130\\u015e fig unions have around 5 000 members in 15 cooperatives. It organises training \\ncourses for its members on tree maintenance, production, harvesting, pruning etc. There are \\napproximately 400 workers operating in the processing plant of TAR\\u0130\\u015e in Germencik and \\nthey processed 4 000 tons of dried figs in 2007, 70% of them were exported and the rest was \\nsold on the domestic market. \\n \\nRRA (\\u00c7ar\\u0131klar village) \\n\\u00c7ar\\u0131klar village is a mountain village in the Germencik district. The village is located on a \\nmountain chain, between Ayd\\u0131n and Izmir, with 165 households and a population of 482. The \\nmain source of income is agriculture and the main products are figs (70%) and olives (30%). \\nFigs are the yellow lobe (sar\\u0131lop) type suitable for drying and olives are generally used for \\nolive oil production. Each household also has 1 or 2 cows for their personal milk and cheese \\nconsumption. Producers sell figs and olives, preferably to TAR\\u0130\\u015e or to merchants (lower price \\nbut cash payments). There are two different cooperatives, one for figs (120 members) and one \\nfor olives (80 members) in the village and they play an active role in the marketing of the \\nproducts. The cooperatives give an advance of 1.5 TL/kg for figs and 2 TL/kg for olives to \\ntheir members as corresponding to the producers\\u2019 previous year delivery. The average annual \\nhousehold income is around 4 000 TL, mostly from agricultural production. \\n \\nProducers understand food quality to be natural and special produce, and the regional \\nspeciality are dried figs. Villagers claim their figs are special due to the geographical and \\nclimatic characteristics (mountain slopes and wind). Producers could not indicate how to \\nshow the difference of their products from others. They have claimed that other figs around \\nthe region -from other valleys in Ayd\\u0131n and Izmir provinces- are also marketed as Ayd\\u0131n figs. \\n 58\\nIn addition, the dried figs of this region (located on the mountain chains) differ from others \\ndue to their skin thickness, taste and appearance (whiteness). \\n \\nOrganic farming is described by local producers as agriculture without fertilizers and \\npesticides; they have no opinion on GAP or GI. It has also been reported that chemical \\nfertilizers are not used every year. \\n \\nAll producers, dealing with fig (1.6 ha) and olive (0.9 ha) production, work on steep land \\nwithout irrigation. \\n  \\nProducers also indicated that, despite the fact that the size of the processing plants did not \\nchange in the last decade, the number of fig trees has decreased due to droughts. They are \\nwell-organised in agricultural marketing cooperatives and new pruning and drying (kerevit \\nusage) methods have recently become more widely applied. They also reported that net profits \\nhave decreased in recent years, mainly due to the rise in input costs compared to the output \\nprice, but also due to droughts. \\n \\nAdvantages are recorded as climate, soil and workforce. Disadvantages are defined as joint \\ntitle deeds, no opportunity for irrigation, a fungus disease which desiccates fig trees and the \\nlack of a suitable credit opportunity for replanting. Producers have themselves invested in \\nplanting trees in recent years, mainly from their own savings. \\n \\n5.1.7. Malatya \\u2013 apricots \\nApricots are grown all over Turkey except in east Anatolia where severe winter conditions \\noccur and in the east Black Sea region because of high humidity. The Malatya region supplies \\naround 60% of Turkey\\u2019s overall apricot production and 7-10% of the world\\u2019s apricot \\nproduction. Almost all apricots obtained from Malatya are dried and 90% are exported. \\nTurkey has a share of around 80-85% in the world dried apricot market. The common \\nimportant variety is Hac\\u0131halilo\\u011flu and 70% of the trees are of this variety. Hac\\u0131halilo\\u011flu is the \\nmost important variety used in drying. Other varieties like Kabaa\\u015f\\u0131, So\\u011fanc\\u0131, \\u00c7atalo\\u011flu and \\n\\u00c7\\u00f6lo\\u011flu are also planted. The total plantation area is around 72 000 ha and the estimated \\nnumber of trees is 7 million. Organic farming is applied on 24 000 ha. \\n \\nThe annual production is around 600 000 tons. The export revenue in recent years reached up \\nto 150 million USD where the annual amount exported is around 70 000-100 000 tons. \\nAround 50 000 households work in apricot cultivation in the Malatya region. As a result of an \\napplication made by Malatya Chamber of Commerce in July 2000, accredited in January \\n2001, the Malatya apricot obtained the status of PDO. The scope of this PDO includes \\nMalatya province and Baskil district (Elaz\\u0131\\u011f province), G\\u00fcr\\u00fcn district (Sivas province), \\nG\\u00f6lba\\u015f\\u0131 district (Ad\\u0131yaman province) and Elbistan district (Kahramanmara\\u015f province). The \\nmain characteristic of Malatya apricots is the high dry matter content, of 23-25%, compared \\nto around 15% for apricots grown elsewhere in Turkey and the world according to the Fruit \\nResearch Institute. Therefore this type of apricot is very suitable for drying and preserving \\nand impedes the mixing with other dried apricots. \\n \\nThe Provincial Directorate of Agriculture, the Fruit Research Institute, the Apricot Research \\nDevelopment and Presentation Foundation, the Apricot Cooperative, Malatya Chamber of \\nCommerce, South Eastern Anatolia Exporters Association, the Apricot Producers Association \\n 59\\nand Governorship of Malatya all deal with coordination of apricot production and marketing \\nin the Malatya province.  \\n \\nThe Provincial Directorate of Agriculture indicates climate as the main factor affecting the \\nyield and also the amount of sulphide to be used. Late spring freezes can negatively affect the \\nquality. Colour changes during the drying period and using sulphide prevents the enzymatic \\nactivity responsible for darkening. It also prevents moulds, yeast, microbial and other insects \\ndue to its antimicrobial nature. The EU accepts a sulphide content of 2 000 parts per million \\n(ppm) and the USA 3 000 ppm. Producers claim that they cannot use less sulphide than the \\ntraditional basis-level. On the other hand, packaging and processing plants claim that \\nproducers overuse sulphide, in consequence they cannot meet a homogeneous level in \\nprocessing and extra costs are incurred to meet the standards set by importing countries.  \\n \\nFirms dealing with exports claim that no problem exists in terms of quality in exports and \\nthey have certification according to HACCP, ISO 9000 and ISO 22000. Actually, no exported \\ndried apricots have been refused. The quality factors monitored in dried apricots are the \\namounts of sulphide-oxide, humidity, pesticide residue, time of harvest, and packaging \\nmaterials used. According to standards set by the Turkish Standards Institution (TSE), dried \\napricots are grouped according to how they are marketed, typed by preparation method, sorted \\nbased on appearance quality, and size class determined by the number of dried apricots per 1 \\nkg. The groups are either natural or with added sulphide; types are with or without kernel and \\ndivided vertically (3 types), sorting is as Extra, Class I, II and Industrial and sizing is on a \\nscale ranging from 1 to 8. In scale 1 there are up to 80 dried apricots in 1 kg and in scale 8 \\nmore than 200. \\n \\nDried apricots are generally exported in packs of 12 or 25 kg and re-packaged in the receiving \\ncountry or used industrially. TSE standards mandate the upper limits of packages as 25 kg in \\nthe domestic market and 100 kg for industrial use. The amount exported in 2007 was 102 000 \\ntons (see Table 16).  \\n \\nTable 16: Dried apricot exports of Turkey   \\nYear Amount (tons) Value (million US $) \\n2000 73 000 112 \\n2001 99 000 89 \\n2002 70 000 122 \\n2003 73 000 152 \\n2004 80 000 199 \\n2005 95 000 179 \\n2006 111 000 194 \\n2007 102 000 236 \\nSource: South-Eastern Anatolia Exporters Association \\n \\nNo firms develop new products based on apricots, as dried apricots from Turkey have a good \\nreputation on the world market. On the other hand, additional promotional activities would \\nincrease apricot consumption worldwide. Although exporting firms complain about the costs \\nthat would be incurred and the lack of capital to support such promotion, some of the larger \\nfirms participate in international fairs with government supports. The main destinations of \\nexports are the USA (more than 60 %), the Russian Federation, the UK and France. The main \\nquality problems are that workers do not take enough care during harvest, drying and storage, \\nand that producers apply varied amounts of sulphide, and that storage facilities near farms are \\nnot suitable. Producers do not take responsibility but claim that they cannot invest in building \\na new storage room.  \\n 60\\n \\nAccording to the Malatya Provincial Directorate of Agriculture, although organic farming \\nincreased in recent years producers do not exactly know (more than 80%) what constitutes \\norganic farming. Those who have the certificate claim that they could not sell their product \\nwith a premium and suggest that quality is mainly due to climate, humidity and not having \\ndroughts. The Provincial Directorate of Agriculture maintains that they have started training \\nprogrammes for GAP and will have results within 3 to 5 years. It has also formed teams for \\nfertilizing and pesticide application according to the meteorological conditions. They are \\ntaking samples to the Diyarbakir Agricultural Research Institute and share the results with the \\nfarmers. \\n \\nRRA (\\u00c7\\u0131\\u011fl\\u0131k village) \\nThe RRA was conducted in the \\u00c7\\u0131\\u011fl\\u0131k village of the Do\\u011fan\\u015fehir district in Malatya province. \\nThere are 180 households and the main source of income is agriculture. The main agricultural \\nactivities are apricot production followed by apple, pear and cherry production, and field \\ncrops are wheat and beans (see table 17). In each household there are 2-3 cows for \\nsubsistence. Agricultural products are marketed through merchants, and marketing \\ncooperatives are not present in the village. However, some farmers are members of the \\nMalatya Apricot Producers' Association (not very active in the marketing of apricots) and also \\nof the Agricultural Credit Cooperative. \\n \\nTable 17: What are the production methods of the products in your village? Could you rank them? \\nProducts \\n(in order of significances) Estimated area planted Number of producers Production method \\nApricots 200 ha 132 Conventional \\nApricots 30 ha 10 Organic \\nApples 80 ha 65 Conventional  \\nWheat 110 ha 110 Conventional \\n \\nThe average annual income is around 5 000-6 000 TL/household, almost 90% from \\nagriculture. Additional incomes are pensions and some people work for the government and \\nprivate sectors in nearby Do\\u011fan\\u015fehir. \\n \\nThe apricot producers consider the attractiveness and product standards as food quality. Dried \\napricots and mulberry products (like mulberry molasses and dried mulberry pulp) are the \\nspecial products of the region. \\n \\nVillagers explain that their soil is different in terms of climate and composition and, therefore, \\napricots produced in the region are of a higher quality and more suitable for drying. Local \\napricots have more syrup and are bigger in size with no marketing problems. Thus, producers \\nsee no need to change their production methods. They do not have a brand name but their \\napricots are recognised all over Turkey as Malatya apricots. Other apricots cannot be \\nconfused with Malatya apricots as they are not suitable for drying.  \\n \\nThere are farmers with organic production certificates in the village on an average land size of \\n5 to 6 ha and engineers from the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture educated them on the \\nprocedure. Organic farming is described by farmers as using very small, controlled amounts \\nof pesticides and they have no knowledge of GAP or GIs. There is an interest in organic \\nfarming because of the price level. No products are marketed as PDO as although Malatya \\napricots officially hold this status producers are not aware of it.  \\n \\n 61\\nIn recent years new orchards have been established in \\u00c7\\u0131\\u011fl\\u0131k due to the increasing availability \\nof water. The production method remained the same in recent years but some producers \\nchanged the varieties of apricot. There are no changes in processing or in organisation of \\nfarmers. The main marketing channel is traders of big firms. The net income has been \\ndecreasing due to increases in labour costs and chemicals whereas the price of apricots has \\nbeen almost constant during the last 5 years.  \\n \\nThe advantages are climate and soil composition, as well as very experienced producers, \\nwhereas the disadvantage is the insufficient capacity of warehouses for drying and storage. \\nThe main investment in the village is made in irrigation systems and pressurized water is \\nheavily used by farmers. Some farmers also invest in new plantations. These are mainly \\ncovered by own capital because it is hard to fulfil bank credit requirements. \\n \\n5.1.8. Antalya (Finike) \\u2013 citrus \\nThe Finike region of Antalya province is an important and renowned orange production area \\nin Turkey. One third of the land suitable for cultivation (around 4 000 ha) is used for fruit \\ncultivation (thereof 3 500 ha for citrus). In the Finike region the orange varieties are \\nWashington, Valencia, Yafa and a native one used for orange juice. There are about 800 000 \\norange trees on 2 900 ha. The Washington variety is grown by around 5 000 farmers and \\nobtained the certification PDO Finike orange in November 2008. The application was made in \\n2006 by the producers' association, which has almost 250 members. The total cost of the PDO \\nprocess was around 20 000 TL. The registered amount of annual production of Finike oranges \\nis around 105 000 tons and the total production amounts to 150 000 tons including \\nunregistered production. Finike oranges are special due to their taste, the uniqueness of their \\naroma, their thin outer and inner skin and rapid ripening (which enables earlier harvest). \\n \\nFarmers' major problems are insects like the Akdeniz fruit fly and mealy-bug during rapid \\nripening in fall. Farmers have also indicated that a lack of knowledge in using fertilizers and \\nin taking care of the trees favours insects. A pesticide residue problem is almost non-existant. \\nIn addition, the gravelled terrain of the valley (in Turun\\u00e7ova where the main production is \\nmade) decreases the yield. The sprinkler irrigation system in one third of the area contributes \\nto the different character of Finike oranges compared to the same cultivars grown elsewhere. \\nThe main marketing problem is that produce from other regions is marketed under the name \\nFinike orange. The selling price of Finike oranges is above the average price in the domestic \\nmarket due to early ripening and harvesting time.  \\n \\nRRA (\\u00c7avd\\u0131r-Turun\\u00e7ova) \\n\\u00c7avd\\u0131r in the Turun\\u00e7ova village has 500 households and 1 800 inhabitants. Citrus fruits and \\ngreenhouse production (mostly eggplants) are the main source of income. Almost 90% of \\ncitrus produced are oranges and the rest are lemons and tangerines. The products are marketed \\nvia merchants to the domestic 'high-price' market in Istanbul. The Fruit Producers' \\nOrganisation has 51 members in \\u00c7avd\\u0131r. So far, this producer organisation has mainly worked \\nto obtain the GI status. The average annual household income is around 10 000 TL based on \\nagriculture. Very few villagers work as tradesmen or porters in logistics firms. \\n \\nHygiene, standards and organic production are mentioned by farmers when defining food \\nquality. The special product is Finike oranges. The main difference in characteristics is due to \\nthe climate of the region. Producers are aware that they benefit from using Finike orange as a \\n 62\\nbrand name. However, merchants also use the name \\\"Finike\\\" for oranges produced in other \\nregions to benefit from its reputation. \\n  \\nProduction without the use of chemicals/pesticides is seen as organic farming by the \\nproducers, and GAP is regarded by farmers as controlled farming. They know about GIs and \\nespecially the PDO Finike oranges, mainly through the Fruit Producers' Organisation, and \\nthey also reported that there are no applications of GAP or organic farming in the region. The \\nfarmers do not believe that introducing organic farming or GAP will create any additional \\nbenefits but may only protect their current status by obtaining a certificate. The average size \\nof the citrus orchards is 1 ha and around 200 households have additional greenhouse areas, \\nwith, on average, less than 0.1 ha. The fruit trees are mainly irrigated by 'flood irrigation' and \\nthe producers mentioned that an orange orchard of less than 0.5 ha is not economically \\nfeasible. \\n \\nAs a result of building greenhouses, fruit orchards are found to be decreasing in recent years. \\nSprinkler irrigation is increasingly used in production but there are no other attempts to \\nincrease the product quality. Producers are not well-organised but there are some emerging \\ndevelopments. The net profit earned from the production is decreasing mainly due to \\nincreasing input prices and decreasing sale prices. \\n \\nThe advantages are climate, soil and experience. The disadvantages are decreasing \\nprofitability and the presence of gravel roads in close proximity to orchards (causing dust and \\nlice on fruits). \\n \\nFarmers have mainly invested in sprinkler irrigation systems (10 000 TL/ha) in recent years \\nand financed them mainly from their own capital, but also partly from subsidised bank credits. \\n \\n5.1.9. Mersin \\u2013 citrus  \\nMersin is one of the leading Turkish regions for citrus production. \\n \\nRRA (Demirhisar Village)  \\nDemirhisar village in Mersin province has 192 households and a population of 1 200. Citrus \\nfruits and vegetables (eggplants and green peppers) are the main source of income. In \\naddition, each household has 1 to 2 cows for subsistence. The village is famous for the \\n'Washington' orange variety, with the best produce found in K\\u0131z\\u0131lalan region. In this region \\nthere are around 6 000 ha of orange orchards. The average yield is around 70 tons/ha ranging \\nfrom 40 to 100 tons/ha. \\n \\nOranges are generally sold to local merchants and sometimes directly to exporters who come \\nto the village. Oranges are mainly sold in bulk directly from the orchard. In addition, some \\noranges are sold in the Mersin Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale Market via agents. No \\ncooperatives exist in Demirhisar but around 20 people are members of an Agricultural Credit \\nCooperative in a neighbouring village. \\n \\nThe average annual income is around 4 000 TL from citrus and vegetables. Farmers define \\nproduct quality as free of pesticides. Oranges are the special product of the region. Oranges \\nfrom this region are sold in the local market and in large cities, and compete with Finike \\noranges (PDO). Therefore to compete, producers would need to develop a brand name for \\nK\\u0131z\\u0131lalan oranges. There are no other products claiming similarity with K\\u0131z\\u0131lalan oranges but \\n 63\\nK\\u0131z\\u0131lalan oranges are sold as Finike oranges in some markets. Organic farming is understood \\nto mean pesticide-free production, and no application of organic farming exists among \\nvillagers. Producers have not heard about GAP and GIs. Due to the location of the village the \\nproduction area is limited and interest in new production technologies is low. \\n \\nIn Demirhisar 192 households have orange trees on a total area of 170 ha. Sizes of orange \\norchards vary as 35 % have less than 0.5 ha, 40 % between 0.5-1 ha and 25 % more than 1 ha. \\nIn the village some farmers cultivate vegetables by renting around 50 ha. \\n \\nProducers claimed that orange farm sizes have decreased during the last decade. Small farms \\nhave abandoned agriculture as people instead go to work in Mersin. Drip irrigation is \\nincreasing and there has been no change in processing or marketing. There is an interest in \\nimproving the quality of the products by lowering the pesticide use. Profits are falling due to \\nlow retail prices and high input prices. \\n \\nThe advantages are the geographical characteristics of the region (providing the favourable \\norange colour), expertise and the climate (humidity and wind), but land plots are small and \\nfragmented causing disadvantages. Producers also stated that they receive bank credits to \\nafford the investment in drip irrigation (around 4 000-5 000 TL per ha). They mentioned high \\nfertilizer prices which result in obtaining small sized products due to undernourishment. The \\nwater price is another topic that farmers have been complaining about (around 1 000 TL/ha). \\nIf two instalments are not paid, the water supply is cut off and interest is charged on a daily \\nbasis. \\n \\n5.1.10. Burdur \\u2013 milk  \\nUpon rapid development after the 1990s, Burdur became one of the leading milk production \\nregions due to the donation of Holstein cows, for milk production, in a joint-venture project \\nwith Holland. This generated major interest around the region and among farmers. The soil is \\nnot very fertile, and therefore, many farmers shifted to milk production. The strength of \\ncooperatives also contributed to the improvement of dairy cow breeding in this region. \\nAccording to the data from the Burdur Provincial Directorate of Agriculture (BPDA), 99 % of \\nthe producers are cooperative members and 98 % use Holstein type cows for milk production. \\nThere are 19 000 members in 141 different cooperatives which form K\\u00f6y-Koop, representing \\n106 000 cows producing around 750 to 800 tons of milk/day. \\n \\nOwing to the developed nature of the cooperatives and the general agreement between \\nmembers; improvements in terms of quality are easily adapted and there are milk collection \\ncentres in villages and small towns, which decrease the risk of microbial contamination after \\nmilking. In addition, there is a memorandum of agreement by BPDA to fine milk collecting in \\nunhygienic conditions and also to support the presence of experienced personnel at the milk \\ncollection centres. In addition, the likelihood of having antibiotics in milk has been reduced as \\nthis is also tested during collection. In the case of positive samples, the responsible farmer \\ncould be identified and he incurs the cost of all the milk collected. Villages have started to \\nbuild milking centres to increase the milk quality, and dairies pay premiums for milk from \\nmilking centres. \\n \\nK\\u00f6y-Koop is the primary responsible central cooperative in the marketing of all the milk \\nobtained in Burdur. Nationwide firms such as Ak G\\u0131da (60 %), Y\\u00f6r\\u00fcko\\u011flu, Cebeci, P\\u0131nar and \\nEkici are the main buyers. Around 10 plants located in Burdur, like Bur-s\\u00fct, \\u00c7avu\\u015fo\\u011flu etc., \\n 64\\nare also important buyers. The capacities of the dairy plants in Burdur are around 400 tons of \\nmilk/day. Each plant announces the amount they will buy daily and pays in advance, based on \\na 3-month deal with the K\\u00f6y-Koop. \\n \\nBur-s\\u00fct, with a capacity of around 50 tons/day, has obtained milk from 8 different \\ncooperatives and processes a further 12 tons/day (November 2008). It has 25 workers in \\nprocessing and produces yoghurt and cheese. The selling points are markets in the Burdur. \\n \\nRRA (B\\u00fc\\u011fd\\u00fcz village) \\nB\\u00fc\\u011fd\\u00fcz village in the Burdur province has 600 households and a population of 1 800. The \\nmain sources of income are milk and cattle farming. Feed crops (clover) are also cultivated. \\nMilk is marketed via the cooperative and fresh meat is sold to merchants. The producers in \\nthe village are either members of the Agricultural Development Cooperative of K\\u00f6y-Koop \\n(450 members) or of the Cattle Breeders Association (CBA). The cooperative is responsible \\nfor collecting raw milk and carries out the marketing for the farmers. It also provides \\nveterinary services, feed and fertilizers. The average income of a household is around 5 000 \\nTL, almost exclusively from agriculture. \\n \\nFarmers define hygiene (especially the microbial count of milk) and the ratio of dry matter to \\nfat content in milk as quality. They also claim that their milk has different characteristics \\nowing to climate and their special feeding method. Their organisational strength \\n(cooperatives) and the presence of milk collection centres in each village and their expertise \\nare the main factors for increasing the quality of milk. Farmers know the basics about organic \\nfarming (production without fertilizers and pesticides), they have no information about GAP \\n(they have not heard about it) and have no knowledge of GIs. They have no intention of \\nproducing with GAP or implementing organic production but they are aware of the fact that \\ncertifications could add value to their products.  \\n \\nThe average number of cows is 7 to 8 per farmer, about 20 farmers have more than 10 and \\n180 farmers have less than 5 cows. The calves born each year are raised and generally sold \\nwithin the first year. The land suitable for arable cultivation is very limited and is mainly used \\nto grow feed for dairy cattle. \\n \\nThe average number of cattle owned by farmers decreased from 10 cows to 7 to 8 during the \\nlast decade, mainly due to the high prices for heifers. The strength of the cooperatives has \\nenabled small farmers to survive. The creation of collection centres is one of the biggest \\nachievements, leading to the building of milking centres in the villages. The increased usage \\nof stainless steel material in the milking process has improved milk quality. The net profit \\nearned from milk production is decreasing mainly due to decreasing real milk prices, and \\nincreasing of feed and veterinary service prices. \\n \\nThe advantages of milk production are the suitability of the land for animal breeding and the \\nwell-organised production structure (cooperatives). Farmers have not invested individually in \\ntechnology. Almost all investments in milking machines are made via the cooperative and the \\ncosts incurred are deducted from the revenues from milk marketing. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 65\\n5.1.11. Konya and Karaman \\u2013 milk  \\nKonya - Ere\\u011fli \\nAccording to the District Directorate of Agriculture there are 121 380 sheep, 5 600 goats, \\n30 710 cattle, and 10 790 calves in Konya - Ere\\u011fli (2008). In the region, 1 500 ha were used \\nfor the production of clover (180 000 tons) and 1 500 ha for maize in 2006. In the same year \\n136 000 tons wheat, 56 000 tons barley, 16 200 tons rye, and 10 800 tons maize were \\nproduced. The total agricultural area is 12 435 ha, of which 4 977 ha are irrigated. The total \\npasture area is 7 683 ha. In 2007, 21 milk plants bought around 178 000 tons of milk from \\n102 000 producers. However, only 54 000 tons of milk were eligible for intensive milk \\npremiums as they met the principal hygienic conditions, accounting for 30% of total milk \\nsold. The region has plants with a capacity above 50 000 tons per year; like Akbel (245 000 \\nton), Bah\\u00e7e Cold Storage and Food (90 000 ton) and Meys\\u00fct (54 000 ton). \\n \\nAccording to the agricultural engineer from the Konya Cattle Breeders' Association (CBA) it \\nis estimated that 7 200 farmers are involved in animal breeding. Almost 4 753 farmers are \\nregistered with the CBA and 4 696 of them are individual farmers, 45 private firms, 4 public \\nenterprises and 328 cooperatives, and the average number of cows owned by these members \\nare 10.3, 78.7, 223.5 and 49.6 respectively. \\n \\nIn Halkap\\u0131nar the total number of cattle is 29 155, of which 11 562 are dairy cows. In Konya \\nthe total number of cattle is 133 489, of which 54 187 are dairy cows. Around 21.3% of the \\ntotal dairy cows are in Ere\\u011fli and Halkap\\u0131nar. For the members of CBA, the average number \\nof cattle is 28 and of dairy cattle is 10.3. The biggest farm is Akbel with 486 cows. The \\naverage milk production per farm household is 21-22 kg/day or 6 500 kg/year. CBA members \\nare benefiting from the following services provided by CBA: \\n1) Artificial insemination \\n2) Pregnancy check \\n3) Genital inflammation control \\n4) ID record (0-6 month); a) birth date, b) sex, c) mother identity d) variety \\n5) Certificated seed supply for fodder production \\n6) Supply of feed additives (vitamins, minerals, premix) \\n7) Heifer supply (from members to members or agricultural development cooperatives or \\nother associations) \\n8) Milking machinery units (for farmers with +50 cows or for small farmers; price in \\n2008 was almost 1 000 TL/unit) \\n9) Disinfectant material and equipment \\n \\nCBA officials have claimed that the region is not suitable for GAP as the plants in the area are \\nnot disease-free. \\n \\nDairy plants collect raw milk from a) farmers directly b) producer associations and c) \\ncooperatives. The large dairies, such as Ak G\\u0131da, S\\u00fcta\\u015f and Akbel, prefer large farms for \\npurchasing milk as they have collecting tanks. In addition, some milk is marketed to firms \\nthrough 'milk agents'. The milk produced from small farms is left in small containers for a \\nwhile and is later collected by small dairies that locally produce dairy products. \\n \\nThe major problems related to milk in the region, reported by CBA, are the misuse of \\nantibiotics (lack of education and training), lack of milking utilities and unhygienic \\nconditions, incorrect feeding (affecting the fat and acid content of milk) and mastitis. In the \\ncase of selling milk containing antibiotics; if exposed, the seller is omitted from the list and \\n 66\\nfined. Beef cattle are sold on the regional market and slaughtered by companies like Ma\\u00e7, \\nAydost and Cihangir. \\n \\nMeys\\u00fct  \\nMeys\\u00fct started its production in 2002 and has operated since 2004 with a capacity of more \\nthan 100 tons/day. The firm produces only UHT milk and employs 65 workers and sells its \\nproduct under different brand names like Bolkar, Talas, Enka and Akbel, mostly in east and \\nsouth eastern parts of Turkey and in regional markets. The firm\\u2019s products are sold in \\nnationwide markets like Kipa-Tesco, Ayta\\u00e7, Yimpa\\u015f and Saray under their brand name. The \\nfirm has ISO-EN-22000 and HACCP certifications. It has 4 'milk agents' collecting milk from \\nthe farms with cooling tanks. \\n \\nMeys\\u00fct analyzes raw milk for acidity (pH), brix, alcohol, hydrogen-peroxide, fat content, \\nantibiotics, and performs sensory analysis. All the information concerning the tanker, amount, \\narrival hour and collected centres are recorded. The firm\\u2019s workers also check the area where \\nmilk is collected before it is transferred to the plant. Also five experts give training to the milk \\nproducers in terms of hygiene (safety), and the quality has improved since 2007 (considering \\nthe results of alcohol tests). \\n \\nThe plant manager has a doctorate in milk processing and is very experienced. He indicated \\nthat they also carry out pesticide and aflatoxin tests.  \\n \\nKonya Ere\\u011fli Milk Producers Association  \\nIt was founded in 2006 with 19 members and as of November 2008 had 75 members (milk \\nproducers), and it has become a major milk collector in the region. The daily milk collection \\nquantity is around 70 tons and it is sold to major nationwide collectors such as Ak G\\u0131da (35 \\ntons), S\\u00fcta\\u015f (10 tons) and Meys\\u00fct (20-22 tons). The market share of the association in Ere\\u011fli \\nwas around 30% in 2008. \\n \\nThe primary condition to become a member is to supply at least 200 litres milk/day, which \\nrequires at least 15 cows. The average number of cows is above 40 and there are 9 \\ncooperatives among the members. There are also two enterprise members with more than 650 \\ncows each. \\n \\nMembers benefit from training on general hygiene, animal feeding etc. free of charge and also \\nreceive animal feed at a discounted rate. Additionally, they obtain certified disinfectants. The \\nassociation collects milk from its members and test samples in its own laboratories for general \\nquality and hygiene standards. Only cooled raw milk is purchased, in order to secure a \\ncomplete cold chain from milking to the dairies. Members disregarding the general hygiene \\nstandards (milk without antibiotics etc.) and Food Codex are expelled from the association. \\nThe microbial count of raw milk is within the legal limits and decreasing, members have to \\npay an entrance fee below the minimum wage. The association also tests for alcohol (not a \\nlegal mandate) to check whether the milk is pure and to extend the shelf life of UHT milk. \\nThe number of members is increasing, mainly due to the incentives added to milk prices by \\nthe association in 2007. \\n \\nKonya-\\u00c7umra \\nOk\\u00e7u, in the village \\u00c7umra, has 600 households with a population of 2 200. The main sources \\nof income are wheat, barley, sugar beet, beans, maize, fodder crops and dairy cattle. Local \\ntraders sell these products in the market. Milk is collected by the producers\\u2019 organisation or \\n 67\\nmilk collectors and the producers' organisation also serves to increase the general hygiene and \\nmilk quality. \\n \\nIn \\u00c7umra there are 80 000 sheep and 33 000 cattle, including 12 000 dairy cows. The annual \\nmilk yield is 5 tons per cow. The agricultural area is around 100 000 ha, about 70% of which \\nis irrigated. Around 60 to 65% of the land is planted with wheat and barley, followed by sugar \\nbeet, cereals and maize (6 500 ha). \\n \\nMilk produced in \\u00c7umra is collected by contractors from Konya. Collected raw milk is left \\noutdoors in plastic containers and collectors use cooling tanks and transfer them to the dairies. \\nThere is a 2% tax on the producer. The Milk Producer Organisation has 72 members, CBA \\n\\u00c7umra Branch has 500 members and there are 3 Agricultural Development Cooperatives. \\n \\n\\u00c7umra Milk Producer Organisation  \\nThe total number of cattle of its 72 members is 1 765, around 25 per member. The association \\nserves its members in terms of cleaning and hygiene, cooling tanks and milking machinery. A \\ntotal of 15 cooling tanks exist with a capacity of around 1 or 2 tons each. Each day around \\n12 200 litres of milk are collected and sold to Ak G\\u0131da (7 500 litre), Sek S\\u00fct (3 000 litre) and \\nOva S\\u00fct (1 700 litre). The milk marketed by the association is tested in terms of the Food \\nCodex and minimum quality and hygiene requirements. If the milk contains antibiotics or \\nwater, there is a high penalty and membership can be cancelled. Veterinarians and food \\nengineers train members on milk quality and hygiene. The annual fee was around 125 TL in \\n2008. In this district, there is a sugar plant and sugar beet is also cultivated and given to the \\ncows as feed, but if the cow is overfed the milk fat content decreases, water content increases \\nalong with the risk of sickness. Therefore, members\\u2019 cows should not be fed with sugar beet. \\nMembers produce around 85% of their feed on their own farms. \\n \\nRRA (\\u00dc\\u00e7harman in Karaman-Ayranc\\u0131) \\nThere are 460 people living in 130 households where the main income is from wheat, barley \\nand sheep farming. Cheese is made from sheep's milk and lamb is sold as fresh meat to Ere\\u011fli. \\n20% of the produced wheat is sold to merchants and the Turkish Grain Board (TMO), the rest \\nis used for self-consumption. Cheese made from sheep's milk is placed in a lamb skin and \\nstored in June in a 36-metre deep underground cave (obruk) and stored there until October-\\nNovember (5 to 6 months). This cheese is known as Divle Obruk cheese and is sold at 17-18 \\nTL/kg whereas lamb's milk is sold at 1 TL/kg so the added value is very high. The village has \\nan Agricultural Development Cooperative with 72 members, which was founded by cattle \\nbreeders from a neighbouring town, K\\u0131raman. The cooperative is supported by a Rural Social \\nSupport Project where each member with at least two cows is supported and members sell \\ntheir milk to Arpac\\u0131 Milk Plant in the near Ere\\u011fli district. The average annual income is 4 000 \\nTL and everybody is involved in agriculture. In the village, 750 ha are planted to wheat and \\nbarley (by 120 producers) and there are 5 000 lambs (owned by 70 farmers) and 200 cattle \\n(owned by 30 farmers). During the last decade there have been severe droughts, thus \\ndecreasing the fertility of the land and productivity. Producers graze the sheep on pastures and \\nfeed the cows with feed produced on their own land. \\n \\nProducers understand hygienic conditions as representing food quality, and the special \\nproduct of the region is Divle Obruk cheese. During the time in the underground cave a red \\nmould covers the lamb skin giving the cheese a unique flavour. A firm in Karaman province \\n(Fidan Milk Plant) has registered a cheese brand under the same name, but the chief of the \\nvillage has sued the firm. There are many fake products marketed in the region under the \\n 68\\nsame name that are produced from a sheep/cow's milk mixture and kept in cold rooms. The \\nvillage, together with the head officials of the district, has applied to the Turkish Patent \\nInstitution (TPE) for GI certificates but they have been denied due to the lack of a proposed \\nprocedure to assess the cheese quality. In the 2007-2008 season around 60 tons of cheese \\nwere stored underground with a value of around 1 000 000 TL. The cave is under the control \\nof the villagers and the management takes 0.5 TL/kg fee. \\n \\nProducers are not aware of organic farming, GAP or GI. During the last decade the number of \\nsheep has decreased from 32 000 in the early 1970s to around 8 000 in 2000 and to 5 000 in \\n2009. Small producers ceased production and many also left the village. Therefore the \\nremaining population is generally elderly. During the last decade no technological \\ndevelopment has been made in terms of cheese production. The producers' organisation is \\npoor and the sheep breeding has additionally slowed during the droughts. There is a decrease \\nin net profit because of higher input costs and lower retail prices of milk, meat and livestock. \\n \\nThe main advantage of the region is the specific production method of Divle Obruk cheese \\nfrom sheep's milk. The disadvantages are the lack of water, droughts and ageing population. \\nThe new members of the Agricultural Development Cooperative in the village are investing in \\nmilking machinery, building a new barn and wells. \\n \\n5.2. Summary results of RRA studies \\n \\nIn Table 18 socio-economic and demographic structures of the selected village are presented, \\nand producers' answers regarding quality issues are assessed in five different levels ranking \\nfrom 'too weak', 'weak', 'fair', 'good' to 'excellent', and taken as 1 to 5, respectively. During the \\nevaluation of answers, no answers and wrong/false answers were categorised as 'too weak'; \\npartially correct answers as 'weak'; correct answers combined with no applications as 'fair'; \\nsome applications as 'good'; and both correct answers and applications as 'excellent'. \\n \\n 69 \\nTable 18: Summary results of RRA studies with farmers in villages  \\nProvince  \\n(sub-province) \\nEvaluation \\ncriterions  \\nAfyon.

Moreover, it is necessary to support GI certification of products \\ncomplying with the required quality. Legal regulations to allow price determination according to \\nquality criteria or policies including quality premium may also provide incentives for investment in \\nquality improvement measures.  \\n0\\n2000\\n4000\\n6000\\n8000\\n10000\\n12000\\nBeef (Afyon)\\nOlive oil (Ayvalik)\\nTomatoes (Kumluca)\\nApples (Egirdir)\\nGrapes - raisins (Alasehir)\\nDried figs (Aydin)\\nDried apricots (Malatya)\\nCitrus (Finike)\\nCitrus (Mersin)\\nMilk (Afyon)\\nMilk (Burdur)\\nMilk (Konya & Karaman)\\nAverage annual\\nhousehold income (TL)\\n  \\nFigure 6: Radar chart for socio-economic structure of producers10 \\n \\nFigure 7 provides an overview on the current knowledge of producers regarding different food quality \\nconcepts.  \\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nBeef (Afyon)\\nOlive oil (Ayvalik)\\nTomatoes (Kumluca)\\nApples (Egirdir)\\nGrapes - raisins (Alasehir)\\nDried figs (Aydin)\\nDried apricots (Malatya)\\nCitrus (Finike)\\nCitrus (Mersin)\\nMilk (Afyon)\\nMilk (Burdur)\\nMilk (Konya & Karaman)\\nQuality\\nOrganic production\\nGood Agricultural\\nPractices (GAP)\\nGeographical\\nIndications (Gis)\\n  \\nFigure 7: Radar chart for producers\\u2019 awareness about quality and quality systems \\n \\n                                                 \\n10 The exchange rate for Turkish Lira (TL) in June, 2009 is 1 \\u20ac = 2.15 TL  \\n 73\\nThere is also a misunderstanding regarding the concept of GIs (Figure 8). For example, some products \\nhave a PGI certificate even if they are not eligible for PGI status but should be classified with TSG \\ncertificates. This would certify the traditional production method and not be linked to the origin of the \\nproduct or the location of the elaboration process. This option is not included in the current Turkish \\nlegislation concerning GIs but is embedded in the draft law. In addition, it is possible to obtain \\ncertification with other quality marks (like \\\"Woolmark\\\") but there is no application as those quality \\nmarks are often unknown.  \\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nBeef (Afyon)\\nOlive oil (Ayvalik)\\nTomato (Kumluca)\\nApple (Egirdir)\\nGrape - Raisins (Alasehir)\\nDried Fig (Aydin)\\nDried Apricot (Malatya)\\nCitrus (Finike)\\nCitrus (Mersin)\\nMilk (Afyon)\\nMilk (Burdur)\\nMilk (Konya & Karaman)\\nInterest in quality  sy stems\\nInterest in  GAP and/or\\norganic production\\nInterest in protected\\nproduction (GIs)\\n  \\nFigure 8: Radar chart of producers\\u2019 interest \\n \\nThe interest of producers in quality production is rapidly developing; however their interest in organic \\nfarming and GAP is low.

In Afyon, the only purpose of \\nachieving a PGI for sucuk production is for the protection of the traditional production methods, not \\nfor marketing reasons. The labour costs in olive oil production are high and many small shops exist in \\nAyvalik (Balikesir). Food safety is a priority for tomato production in Kumluca, Antalya, and grape \\nand raisin production in Alasehir (Manisa) strive to comply with export market requirements and \\nrequested export formalities. Apple production in Egirdir (Isparta) is convenient for GAP applications \\nbecause there is a limited but well-equipped production area (such as drip irrigation systems, pesticide \\npreparation areas, warehouses, packaging units etc.). Fig producers in Aydin could charge higher \\nprices for their product because it is a unique place for producing high quality dried figs. Dried \\napricots are sold in bulk so it is impossible to use GIs in Malatya. Orange producers in Antalya also get \\nhigher prices for their product because Finike oranges have a unique taste and the harvesting period is \\n 75\\nalmost one month earlier than other varieties. There are marketing advantages for orange producers in \\nMersin because its location is so close to the citrus exporters and fresh-cut fruit and fruit juice \\nproducers. Buffalo milk producers in Afyon could add extra value to milk by producing traditional \\nmilk products (cream). Milk producers in Burdur get premium milk prices because the producers are \\nvery well clustered within cooperatives in this region. Milk producers in Konya and Karaman could \\nadd value by producing cheese.  \\nAs a result, by combining the evaluation with the assessment of the regions, it is found that some \\nproducts could potentially be successful candidates for GIs: \\n\\u2022 Ayvalik olive oil; \\n\\u2022 Finike oranges; \\n\\u2022 Afyonkarahisar cream; and \\n\\u2022 Afyonkarahisar sucuk (whether this product could achieve a premium price versus private \\nbrands needs to be analysed). \\n \\nSome products were determined as having potential for organic production: \\n\\u2022 Dried apricots; \\n\\u2022 Dried figs; \\n\\u2022 Milk (only for medium and large scale farms); and  \\n\\u2022 Beef (only for medium and large scale farms). \\n \\nSome products were determined as favourable for GAP application: \\n\\u2022 Citrus produce; \\n\\u2022 Apples; \\n\\u2022 Tomatoes; \\n\\u2022 Milk (the disease-free status of the region should be announced by TKB); and   \\n\\u2022 Meat (the disease-free status of the region should be announced by TKB). \\nIn addition, Divle Obruk cheese in Konya and Karaman could be certificated with a TSG. \\n \\n 76\\n6. Conclusions and recommendations \\nConclusions \\n\\u2022 Lack of quality awareness of consumers and producers is determined as one of the main \\nproblems from the SWOT and LFM studies. Producers' knowledge is limited and their quality \\nperception focuses mainly on food safety. Furthermore disorganised small scale producers are \\nunable to solve quality issues by themselves.  \\n\\u2022 The coordination and collaboration among actors in the food chain are very weak in terms of \\ndeveloping and ensuring a quality assurance scheme, resulting in problems in supplying \\nreliable quality products to markets. Different organisations and institutions are also \\nresponsible for different aspects of quality production and assurance. Moreover, there are many \\ninstitutional conflicts, not only with regards to the relationship between organisations and/or \\ninstitutions but also within organisations and their own implementations. \\n\\u2022 Incentives for food quality through complementary procedures do not exist. Thus, SMEs and \\nagricultural holdings are not supported financially to improve quality assurance, therefore \\nlimiting investments in quality production. In conclusion, it is difficult for small producers and \\nenterprises to accumulate capital to improve product quality, which might lead to exclusion \\nfrom dynamic food markets. \\n\\u2022 There are barriers in exports due to quality that reduce the Turkish share in world food markets. \\nHowever, the infrastructure regarding food safety issues, such as minimum legal requirements, \\nrequested by importing country authorities and/or multinational food retail chains has generally \\nbeen improved. \\n\\u2022 Key stakeholders are not sufficiently organised to obtain GI certification for the important food \\nproducts in their region. This leads to overlaps among certified products and failure in product \\nprotection. Moreover, producers were uninformed about GIs and have little interest in GIs due \\nto their small scale. \\n\\u2022 There was only one producer organisation (producer union) established by the region\\u2019s \\nproducers with a GI certificate. The other certifications were obtained by cooperatives, \\nchambers of commerce and industry, municipalities and provincial governance. \\n\\u2022 Only tomato producers achieved GAP applications among selected products. \\n\\u2022 Lack of trust in quality certification audits and auditing competences leads to moral hazards.  \\n\\u2022 Observations showed that there were great quality improvements in milk production; the milk \\nquality now exceeds the minimum Food Codex requirements. The main driver for this \\nimprovement is the existence of large scale national and international dairy companies pushing \\nforward quality standards in the market. However, small producers could be excluded from this \\ndynamic market because of their traditional production techniques and infrastructure which \\ndoes not fulfil buyers' requirements. \\n\\u2022 Through the RRA studies on participation of small-scale producers in organic farming it was \\nalso observed that they voiced low interest.  \\n\\u2022 Academic studies and research projects (funded by TUBITAK \\u2013 The Scientific and \\nTechnological Research Council of Turkey) are limited in number and also require an \\nimprovement in quality. \\n \\n \\nRecommendations \\n\\u2022 Quality awareness of consumers and producers must be improved by training and by using \\ncommunication means to effectively overcome food quality assurance schemes problems in \\nTurkey. To serve this purpose, institutions like TKB, DPT, TPE, TSE, TZOB etc. should \\ncooperate. \\n\\u2022 There should be cooperation between TKB and MEB (the Ministry of National Education) in \\nraising awareness of students in compulsory education. \\n 77\\n\\u2022 Public awareness raising campaigns should be organised, supported by sector associations \\n(NGOs), TKB and other public institutes. Meetings with mass media representatives and \\njournalists should be organised on the topic of food quality; public TV channels (TRT) and \\nother national and also local coverage channels should keep the topic 'hot' on their agenda. \\n\\u2022 There is a need for a complementary perspective and coordination among responsible \\ninstitutions on food quality.  \\n\\u2022 Infrastructure investments for improving food quality assurance systems should be sustained by \\nTKB and other related institutes parallel to the development and quality and safety demands of \\nthe domestic and international markets. \\n\\u2022 Quality infrastructure development projects should be sustained by using EU and/or World \\nBank (WB) grants.  \\n\\u2022 TKB should design support schemes for further improving food quality which must cover GIs \\nand trademark certified products.  \\n\\u2022 The Under-Secretary of Foreign Trade (DTM) should support exports of safety and quality \\nguaranteed products and should also conduct market research on products with organic labels \\nand a high level of quality standards.  \\n\\u2022 KOSGEB (The Supporter Association of SMEs in Turkey) and TKB should associate rural \\ndevelopment supports with traceability applications. \\n\\u2022 The EU accession period should not be interrupted and the adoption period of the legislation \\nshould be completed accordingly. \\n\\u2022 Future research may focus on supply chain analysis and obstacles in collaboration between key \\nactors, consumer response to quality in domestic markets, and on a model to prevent small \\nscale producers being excluded from dynamic markets.  \\n \\n \\n 78\\nReferences \\nAlpay, S., I.

The governance structure of food quality assurance in Turkey is explained, which includes \\npublic, semi-public and private institutes, laws and legislations, policies and research.  Lack of consumer and \\nproducer quality awareness is determined as the main problem by SWOT and Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) \\nstudies. A Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) study was conducted by interviewing local stakeholders. Turkish \\nproducers' knowledge is limited and their quality perception focuses mainly on food safety. There are barriers in \\nexports due to quality that reduce the Turkish share in world food markets. The study concludes with several \\nrecommendations on how problems in Turkish food quality assurance schemes could be effectively overcome.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHow to obtain EU publications \\n \\nOur priced publications are available from EU Bookshop (http://bookshop.europa.eu), where you can place \\nan order with the sales agent of your choice. \\n \\nThe Publications Office has a worldwide network of sales agents.

      "        \"abstract\": \"European food industries are responsible for the safety of the food products brought on the market. Therefore, a legal demanded food safety management system (FSMS) or self-checking system (SCS) is implemented in companies, often based on commercial quality assurance standards as ISO22000, BRC or IFS. The Belgian government provides the possibility for food business operators to have their SCS approved by means of audits conducted by either the competent food safety authority, FASFC, or by a commercial certification body,  recognised by the government. The audits are based on specifically developed guides for self-checking per sector, approved by the Belgian government. In view of evaluating the effect of the self-checking system certification on the performance of an implemented FSMS and the companies\\u2019 microbiological food safety output, this paper presents the results of an independent self-assessment conducted by eighty-two food business operators in Belgium. The study was conducted in spring/summer of 2010. The outcome of this study is discussed against national inspection results by the FASFC of the year 2009, 2010 and 2011 in Belgian food companies. The enforcement of a SCS by the Belgian government on the performance of a FSMS, their food safety output and their inspection results is less clear for food processing companies compared to the positive effect for the distribution sector. The majority of food processing companies were already certified for a voluntary system next to the legal demanded SCS. No significant difference could be identified between SCS certified and non-certified companies; large, medium or small scale companies and the sector in which they are working for food processing companies. Five clusters could be identified in the performance of a FSMS and microbiological food safety output. In overall Belgian processing companies are having a good performing FSMS and microbiological food safety output\",\n",

UVOD \\n \\nPostupci povezani s procesom osiguravanja kvalitete \\nunutar Europskog prostora visokog obrazovanja postaju \\nsve kompleksniji i sofisticiraniji. Visoka u\\u010dili\\u0161ta se \\npoti\\u010de na posve\\u0107ivanje osobite pozornosti pra\\u0107enju, \\nprovjeravanju i vrednovanju svih aspekata svoje \\ndjelatnosti te uspostavi usporedivih kriterija procjene i \\npripadnih metodologija. Sve ovo vodi  izgradnji \\ncjelovitih sustava osiguravanja kvalitete. \\nIzgradnja sustava za osiguravanje kvalitete (SOK) na \\nvisokim u\\u010dili\\u0161tima (QA) postavljena je kao nu\\u017enost i \\nsvakodnevnica na svim visokim u\\u010dili\\u0161tima te neupitan \\nosnovni pojam i najvi\\u0161e postavljeni cilj Bolonjske \\nreforme. U sredi\\u0161tu sustava za osiguranje kvalitete na \\nvisoko\\u0161kolskim u\\u010dili\\u0161tima sve se vi\\u0161e koristi pojam \\nkulture kvalitete. Rije\\u010d je o pojmu koji prenosi ideju \\nkvalitete kao zajedni\\u010dke vrijednosti i zajedni\\u010dke \\nodgovornosti svih dionika visoko\\u0161kolskih u\\u010dili\\u0161ta, \\nuklju\\u010duju\\u0107i ne samo nastavno nego i administrativno \\nosoblje, studente, poslodavce, zainteresirane udruge, \\u0161iru \\ndru\\u0161tvenu zajednicu i dr. Ovakvo shva\\u0107anje kvalitete \\npodrazumijeva i ugra\\u0111ivanje kontinuiranog \\npobolj\\u0161avanja svih glavnih, upravlja\\u010dkih i logisti\\u010dkih \\nprocesa na u\\u010dili\\u0161tu. Kad je rije\\u010d o operacionalizaciji \\novako na\\u010delnog shva\\u0107anja kulture kvalitete, valja re\\u0107i da \\nipak postoje stanovite smjernice na koje se mogu\\u0107e \\nosloniti u konkretnom djelovanju u visoko\\u0161kolskim \\nu\\u010dili\\u0161tima. U posljednje vrijeme mo\\u017ee se primijetiti da se \\npojam osiguravanja kvalitete sve \\u010de\\u0161\\u0107e povezuje s \\nkonkretnim primjerima dobre prakse na nacionalnoj i na \\nme\\u0111unarodnoj razini, uz brojne poticaje da se kao temelj \\nsustava usvoje Europski standardi i smjernice.  \\n\\u2022 Za uspje\\u0161an postupak prilagodbe navedenim \\nsmjernicama potrebno je provesti: \\n\\u2022 Ustroj sustava za osiguranje kvalitete; \\n\\u2022 Implementaciju smjernica u postoje\\u0107e procese \\nvisokog u\\u010dili\\u0161ta; \\n\\u2022 Interne prosudbe sustava za osiguranje kvalitete; \\n\\u2022 Vanjsku neovisnu prosudbu sustava kvalitete; \\n\\u2022 Proces stalnog pobolj\\u0161avanja efikasnosti sustava za \\nosiguranje kvalitete \\n \\nOsim navedenog, za efikasan i u\\u010dinkovit sustav za \\nosiguravanje kvalitete postavljaju se tri uvjeta: \\n1. sustav mora postojati,  \\n2. sustav mora biti operativan (mora biti odr\\u017eavan) i \\n3. sustav mora biti efikasan (moraju se pokretati mjere \\npobolj\\u0161avanja). \\n \\nSustav postoji ukoliko je implementiran u sve procese \\n(studijske programe, odjele, ustrojbene jedinice i sl.), \\nodnosno ukoliko se mo\\u017ee sagledati i prikazati, i ukoliko \\nse razumije od svih zaposlenika i podr\\u017eava svim \\npotrebnim resursima od najvi\\u0161eg vodstva visokog \\nu\\u010dili\\u0161ta. Da bi se SOK sagledao i prikazao mora imati \\njasnu strukturu te mora imati dokumentirane postupke i \\nostalu potrebnu dokumentaciju koja mora biti \\nraspolo\\u017eiva na mjestima kori\\u0161tenja. \\n172 Technical journal 9, 2(2015), 172-176\\nKondi\\u0107 \\u017d., Vi\\u0161nji\\u0107 V., Ma\\u0111eri\\u0107 D.                                                                                               Osiguravanja kvalitete visokog obrazovanja na primjeru Sveu\\u010dili\\u0161ta Sjever \\n \\nNakon u\\u010dinkovito provedenih postupaka \\nimplementacije SOK-e potrebno ga je odr\\u017eavati. Nekad \\nje lak\\u0161e provesti postupke ustroja i primjene od \\npostupaka odr\\u017eavanja efikasnog sustava. Ako se ne \\nprovode primjerice, mjere kontrole, nadzora ili analiza  \\nmogu\\u0107e je s velikom vjerojatno\\u0161\\u0107u o\\u010dekivati da \\u0107e \\nefikasnost dobro ustrojenog sustava i\\u0107i prema dolje. Sve \\nte aktivnosti treba promatrati kao sustavni na\\u010din \\npotvr\\u0111ivanja da je SOK-e definiran i shva\\u0107en na \\nodgovaraju\\u0107i na\\u010din, da se primjenjuje i da osigurava \\nodgovaraju\\u0107i stupanj pouzdanosti i sigurnosti. Iz tih \\nrazloga nadzori, provjere, kontrole i sl. predstavljaju \\njednu od najzna\\u010dajnijih njegovih komponenti jer je \\nnjihov rezultat dokumentirani zapis i dokaz da je sustav \\nefikasan i da se u njemu otkrivaju i uo\\u010davaju \\nnesukladnosti. Kad se nesukladnosti konstatiraju, sustav \\nmora osigurati alate i metode te potrebne resurse za \\nnjihovo otklanjanje te poduzimanje procijenjenih \\nkorektivnih i preventivnih aktivnosti. \\nU biti, uspje\\u0161ni SOK-e zahtijeva sustavne, formalne, \\nstalne i dokumentirane nadzore s planiranim povratnim \\nnadzorima u cilju provjere primjene poduzetih \\npreventivnih ili korektivnih mjera, odnosno njihove \\nu\\u010dinkovitosti kako se uo\\u010dene nesukladnosti ne bi \\nponovile ili sprije\\u010dila pojava drugih mogu\\u0107ih \\nnesukladnosti. \\nAktivnosti nadzora su postupci prikupljanja podataka \\ni informacija koji se zasnivaju na objektivnim i \\nnepristranim dokazima.

USTROJ SUSTAVA OSIGURAVANJA \\nKVALITETE \\n \\nSustav osiguravanja kvalitete na visoko\\u0161kolskim \\nu\\u010dili\\u0161tima treba slijediti potrebe svih dionika uklju\\u010denih u \\nprocese [2, 3]. Ovakva su razmi\\u0161ljanja prethodila \\nusvajanju dokumenta \\u201eStandardi i smjernice za \\nosiguravanje kvalitete u Europskom prostoru visokog \\nobrazovanja\\u201c (\\u201eStandards and Guidelines for Quality \\nAssurance in the European higher Education Area\\u201c, ili \\nskra\\u0107eno ESG). Ovaj je dokument izradila Europska \\norganizacija za osiguranje kvalitete u visokom \\nobrazovanju (ENQA) u suradnji s Europskom udrugom \\nsveu\\u010dili\\u0161ta (EUA), Europskim udru\\u017eenjem institucija \\nvisokog obrazovanja (EURASHE) i nacionalnim \\nsavezom studenata Europe (ESIB), a prihvatili su ga svi \\nministri nazo\\u010dni na konferenciji u Bergenu 2005. godine \\n[4]. \\nKonkretno je rije\\u010d o dokumentu koji ne predstavlja \\npopis zahtjeva \\u0161to ih je potrebno ostvariti u sustavu \\nobrazovanja, nego o vrlo \\u0161iroko postavljenim savjetima o \\nstandardima i mehanizmima koje bi trebalo ostvariti na \\nvisoko\\u0161kolskim u\\u010dili\\u0161tima koje \\u017eele pripadati Europskom \\nprostoru visokog obrazovanja (EHEA). Dokument se \\nodnosi na tri podru\\u010dja osiguravanja kvalitete, i to: \\n1. Podru\\u010dje unutarnjeg osiguravanja kvalitete \\n(uspostavlja se unutar u\\u010dili\\u0161ta visokog obrazovanja), \\n2.

Steiner \\n \\n____________________ \\n \\n \\n  \\n  2 \\nIntroduction \\nWith  the  emergence  of  the  first  BSE  case  in  Germany  in  November  2000,  consumer \\nconfidence into the safety of meat products quickly eroded and led to a rapid restructuring of \\ngovernment  agencies  and  policy  instruments  related  to  food  safety.\\n1  Similar to the  1996 \\nrelease of information in Germany about British BSE cases, the arrival of the first BSE cases \\nin Germany in 2000 led to a highly intense and emotional reaction among German consumers \\n(Loy and Steiner, 2004). This intense, though periodic, mass-level attention to BSE is an \\nimportant attribute of contested governance (Ansell  and Vogel, this volume) that has proven \\nto be more distinct in Germany than in France or Britain  (Besan\\u00e7on et al., Rothstein, this \\nvolume). In November 2000, the mass-level attention to BSE did not only lead to a reduction \\nof beef-eating by more than half, but had repercussions for the entire food marketing chain, \\nthe animal breeding industry, the catering business and EU farm policy as a whole (Economist \\n2001; Fox and Peterson 2004). Under political pressure, the federal minister of agriculture \\nannounced the establishment of a new ministry branch solely devoted to food safety, only one \\nweek after the first BSE case was reported.\\n2 One month after the first BSE case, Chancellor \\nSchr\\u00f6der announced that BSE had become one of his top priority issues (\\u201eChefsache\\u201f). When \\nthe  federal  ministers  of  agriculture  and  health  refused  to  consider  further  swift  changes, \\nSchr\\u00f6der forced them to resign in January 2001 and named a female lawyer from the Green \\nparty, Renate K\\u00fcnast, the new minister of agriculture. For the first time in German history, the \\nminister of agriculture came from outside the sector. In addition to the changes in personnel, \\n                                                 \\n1 See Loy and Steiner (2004) for a review of the history of the BSE crisis in Germany and an exploration of \\nprice-setting behavior in the beef supply chain related to the 1996 BSE events. Fox and Peterson (2004) provide \\nfor more detailed scientific background on BSE and a chronology across Europe. \\n2 The Health Ministry was, up to then, fully responsible for handling food safety issues.  \\n  3 \\nthe Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry was renamed as the Ministry of Consumer \\nProtection, Food and Agriculture. \\n \\nIn light of these changes, an important question is: to what extent do the observed institutional \\ngovernance modifications reflect continued contested governance in terms of public distrust, \\nwhen it challenges the legitimacy of institutional arrangements related to food safety (Ansell \\nand Vogel, this volume).\\n3 This chapter attempts to address this issue by exploring  the scope \\nand  effectiveness  of  visual  changes  in  governance  in  Germany,  including  the  policy \\ninstruments that were implemented to address food safety issues and particularly the eroding \\ntrust in public authority. The key role of regaining trust into public authority in this process is \\nechoed by policymakers themselves. Renate K\\u00fcnast identified this as her top priority, by \\nemphasizing that \\u201cTrust through change must be our motto.\\u201d (K\\u00fcnast 2002). David Byrne, \\nEuropean Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, has announced that \\u201cClearly \\nthere is a need to develop trust. The food safety agencies, which have been established in \\nmany European countries, serve as good examples. These agencies create a credible and \\nvisible distance between different government structures with the broad aim of increasing \\ntransparency  which,  in  turn,  bolsters  public  acceptance  and  confidence.\\u201d  (Byrne  2004). \\nHowever, before exploring to what extent these calls for public trust and reduced contestation \\nwere more than cosmetic rhetoric, this chapter first considers some specifics of Germany as \\nthey relate to food safety and food markets in general. \\n                                                 \\n3  \\u201cThroughout  his  book,  North  [1981]  \\u2026  argues  that  good  institutions  will  simultaneously  support  private \\ncontracts and provide checks against expropriation by the government or other politically powerful  groups. \\nThere is a growing consensus among economists and political scientists that the broad outlines of North\\u201fs story \\nare correct: the social, economic, legal and political organization of a society, i.e., its \\u201cinstitutions\\u201d, are a primary \\ndeterminant of economic activity.\\u201d Acemoglu and Johnson (2003: 4).  \\n  4 \\n \\nGermany  could  be  characterized  by  highly  price-sensitive  consumers.  Discounters,  for \\nexample, have gained a market share of close to 40 percent, which is higher than in any other \\nEuropean  country  (M+MPlanetRetail  2002).\\n4  At the same time, only   a small fraction of \\nconsumers  are  purchasing  organic  meat, which  consumers  perceive  as  being  \\u201esafer\\u201f  than \\nconventional meat products.\\n5  \\n \\nGiven Germany\\u201fs traditional reliance on state intervention since the Bismarck Era, a shift \\ntowards  more  industry-led  initiatives  in  the  food  sector  seems,  at  first  sight,  to  be  more \\nchallenging and more appropriate than in other European countries. Industry-led initiatives, \\nsuch as the 2001 voluntary national quality assurance scheme \\u201cQuality and Safety\\u201d (\\u201eQS\\u201f), \\ncan  be  highly  desirable  in  a  world  of  increasingly  differentiated  food  produce.  With \\nincreasing  complexity  in  the  food  system,  a  greater  reliance  on  market  mechanisms  that \\nexploit the informational advantages of decentralized market participants has advantages over \\nstate intervention. This is because competitive forces can deliver efficient price discovery by \\nexploiting  local  and  idiosyncratic  information  (Hayek  1945)  and  by  giving  important \\nincentives \\u2013 for example through reputation \\u2013 that are necessary for the functioning of quality \\nassurance schemes.\\n6 At the same time, increasing complexity calls for a stricter separation of \\ntasks  between  markets  and  government  and  a  stronger  government  focus  on  auditing \\nmechanisms and liability law. \\n                                                 \\n4 In 2002, the sales of discounter Aldi alone grew by 16% (M+MEurodata 2003). \\n5 Organic share of total food production in 2000:  2.2% (Hamm, Gronefeld and Halpin 2002). \\n6 As we know from information economics, there is a role for government intervention, since Hayek\\u201fs (1945) \\nfundamental  insight  into  market  efficiency  only  holds  when  markets  operate  in  the  absence  of  imperfect \\ninformation.  A more refined argument would  also need to take account of trade and industrial organization \\nissues,  such  as  the  observed  increasing  concentration  in  the  German  food  industry.  These  issues  raise  new \\nconcerns related to multi-level governance. Issues related to credence attributes will be discussed below.  \\n  5 \\n \\nIndeed, we observe an increasing degree of government intervention along those dimensions \\nwhen  considering  the  food  safety  related  regulations  initiated  by  Mrs.  K\\u00fcnast,  or  EU \\ndirectives related to food safety.  To emphasize, such intervention can generally be justified, \\nsince it  is  well known that without intervention, a  market failure exists  in delivering the \\noptimal level of safety at the margin. The underlying problem of inadequate or asymmetric \\ninformation can not only be addressed through the regulation of liability, but also by public \\ninformation  provision,  and  through  the  mandatory  implementation  of  minimum  quality \\nstandards or guarantees.\\n7  \\n \\nThe case for  government intervention  with regards  to setting  minimum  product quality \\nstandards is a critical one in the context of this chapter.\\n8 In a world of increasing proliferation \\nof  brands  and  private  quality  assurance  systems,  the  problem  of  transparency  and \\nheterogeneity of product quality standards can  often be addressed more efficiently through  \\nmandated quality standards,  since  certified  quality  standards reduce information c ost to \\nconsumers about the safety level of quality attributes.  Importantly, product quality standards \\nrather than process quality standards enable the industry to choose the most efficient  method \\n                                                 \\n7 Evidence of this is found in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 which created the European Food Safety Authority \\nand established traceability at all stages in the food marketing chain. \\n8 Both extrinsic quality attributes (e.g. \\u201eQS label\\u201f) and intrinsic quality attributes (e.g. \\u201eorganic\\u201f) impact on the \\nquality perception of consumers. Intrinsic quality dimensions include therefore process attributes that are not \\nobservable at the point of purchase and may thus lead to market failure (even from ex post observations the \\nbuyer can never be certain of the quality of the services he purchased (Emons 1997)). The literature (Nelson \\n1970) has therefore differentiated credence attributes from experience attributes (whose utility is assessed after \\npurchase by actual consumption) and search attributes (which can be determined by inspection without the need \\nfor consumption).    \\n  6 \\nof achieving a given level of food safety.\\n9 In sum, since markets can help to resolve failures \\nrelated to food safety through competition and reputation, and since governments can take an \\nimportant role with regards to liability and information provision, a balanced, accountable and \\ntransparent division of responsibilities poses the greatest challenge to a government trying to \\nregain consumer confidence and assure an optimal degree of food safety at the margin.\\n10 \\n \\nThe following chapter aims to focus on the newly emerging mix of  market and government \\ninitiatives  in  Germany  with  regards to  food safety ,  as  exemplified by  an  industry  led, \\nvoluntary national quality assurance scheme (\\u201eQS\\u201f) and the reform of governance structures at \\nthe federal level. Following a discussion of the changing scope of governance with regards to \\nfood safety, the chapter discusses the effectiveness and efficiency of the emerging reform \\nelements of the new governance structures related to food safety. In doing so, this chapter \\ntries to answer to what extent food-safety related governance in Germany remains contested. \\nFinally, this chapter aims to provide an outlook on emerging tensions between governance \\nmodes,  since  these  tensions  are  likely  to  determine  the  accountability,  competence  and \\nefficiency of forthcoming food safety regulations. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n9 In this sense, the European Commission has opted for efficiency: the White Paper on Food safety promotes \\nfood safety standards and emphasizes that food safety is related to the attributes of the products, not to a specific \\nmethod of production. \\n10  Persson et al. (1997) make this call for accountability and transparency very clear in their analysis of political \\naccountability: \\u201cAnother relevant problem is how to increase the accountability and transparency of decisions in \\nthe European Union: witness the handling of the mad-cow disease by the European Commission.\\u201d (p.1199).  \\n  7 \\nThe Changing Scope of Governance \\n \\nGiven  the  federal  structure  and  the  institutions  that  are  associated  with  a  \\u201esocial  market \\neconomy\\u201f such as Germany, we expect that the underlying system of governance as related to \\nfood safety is distinctly different from other economies (Chandler 1990).\\n11 However, before \\nexploring several changes in  Germany\\u201fs  governance structure related to food safety, it is \\nessential to identify what is meant by scope of governance, governance structure and its role \\nin shaping an incentive structure that underlies economic activity and political distress. \\n \\nFollowing North (1990), Nelson and Sampat (2001) and vonTunzelmann (2003), the scope of \\ngovernance can be captured by three key elements: process, structure and control.  In the \\ncontext  of  this  chapter,  we  consider  governance  processes  as  the  changing  roles  and \\nrelationships  of  agents  and  agencies  in  the  course  of  the  BSE  events  in  Germany.\\n12 \\nGovernance  structure  relates  to  the  different  forms  through  which  decisions  are  made. \\nStructures can thus induce and govern collective decision making. Finally, the capability of \\ngovernance (competence) needs to be captured: control refers to the power to make economic \\nand policy decisions through different structures.  \\n \\nIn identifying the key parameters of regulatory organizations in OECD countries, Scott (2003) \\nsuggests that there are at least three main combinations of form and power: organizations \\n                                                 \\n11  Scholars  in  other  areas,  for  example  finance,  have  argued  that  we  can  distinguish  national  systems  of \\ngovernance, as defined by their methods of decision making and the underlying balance of power (Albert 1993). \\nConsider  also  that  Presidential  and  Parliamentary  democracies  involve  different  incentive  structures, \\ninformational asymmetries and thus scope for abuse of power (Persson, Roland and Tabellini 1997). \\n12 This is meant to include changes in information processes, such as changes in a newly regula ted information \\nexchange between local and federal ministries.  \\n  8 \\nestablished  and  given  power  by  statute;  organizations  established  without  direct  state \\ninvolvement,  through  contracts  or  incorporation,  but  empowered  by  state  legislative \\ninstruments; and non-state organizations exercising private regulatory power (p.309).\\n13 For \\nexample, consider  the contrast between  conventional modes of governance that rely on \\nlengthy legislative processes,  and more flexible governance modes such as  those that rely \\nmore heavily on regulatory agencies or voluntary standards (e.g. \\u201eQS\\u201f). Lengthy legislative \\nprocesses  are  more  vulnerable  to  political  and  lobbying  distress  due  to  their  structure  as \\ncompared to the more robust and flexible structure of regulatory agencies in a \\u201esocial market \\neconomy\\u201f, which are likely to undergo appropriate checks and balances.  They are, therefore, \\nmore likely to be accountable and democratically legitimate (Persson, Roland and Tabellini \\n1997). This is perhaps  where the economic view of scope of governance is echoed most \\nclosely  in  the  political  view  of  contested  governance,  in  terms  of  its  challenge  to  the \\nlegitimacy of existing institutional arrangements, and in terms of its sectoral or multi-sectoral \\nscope  (Ansell  and  Vogel,  this  volume).  Consider  that  the  \\u201enew  institutional  economics\\u201f \\nliterature refers to a governance structure as the institutional framework within which the \\nintegrity  of  a  transaction  is  decided  (Williamson  1979:  235).  The  elements  of  such  an \\ninstitutional framework, the institutions themselves, are the humanely devised constraints that \\nstructure political,  economic and social  interaction (North 1991:  97).  According to  North \\n(1991), these institutions consist of the informal constraints (sanctions, customs) and formal \\nrules (laws, property rights) that define part of the choice set of economic agents and thus \\ndetermine  the  profitability  and  feasibility  of  engaging  in  economic  activity  (p.97).  These \\n                                                 \\n13 \\u201cParadoxically the last of these is often the most independent and most powerful because of its capacity to \\ncombine  each  of  the  three  regulatory  functions  of  rule-making,  monitoring  and  enforcement,  without  the \\ninvolvement of any other organizations.\\u201d (Scott, 2003: 309).  \\n  9 \\ninformal constraints and formal rules lie at the heart of those conditions that either challenge \\nor support the legitimacy of existing institutional arrangements, and can therefore be directly \\nassociated with contested governance in the sense of Ansell and Vogel (this volume). \\n \\nGiven a mix of formal and informal constraints, the power of making economic and policy \\ndecisions through the above structures often fails to deliver equity and efficiency. We can \\nidentify  several  forms  of  failures  that  can  be  made  responsible  here:  market  failure, \\ngovernment failure, corporate failure and network failure. There are two reasons why these \\ndifferent modes of failures should not be considered in isolation in the context of our analysis, \\nFirst, we are interested in exploring changes in the scope of governance following the BSE \\noutbreak in Germany, as they relate to the changing scope of contestation. Consider that the \\ninterrelationship  between  different  modes  of  failure  can  directly  be  linked  to  the  BSE \\noutbreak  as  such.  Government  failure  exacerbated  market  failure  by  relying  on  non-\\ntransparent decision-making and thus hampering economic incentives. Due to inappropriate \\nliability  rules  at  the  farm  and  processing  level,  as  well  as  inadequate  and  asymmetric \\ninformation in the provision of ruminant feedstuff, a market failure emerged. But inadequate \\nliability at the level of public authorities and thus the failure to align incentives between \\nagents  in  the  political  hierarchies  were  also,  most  likely,  important  reasons  for  the  BSE \\noutbreak. As a further example, consider the UK where the specified bovine offal ban failed \\nfor at least two reasons. First, it failed because of the non-compliance of industry-participants. \\nSecond, it failed because government officials who were in charge of designing and enforcing \\nthe ruminant feed ban did not act in the interest of society. Government officials decided to \\nlower the temperature for treating animal protein in feedstuff processing, while their decision- \\n  10 \\nmaking process took place in the absence of public scrutiny.\\n14 Therefore the conditions that \\nled to the outbreak  of BSE may be regarded as a prime example for contested governance: \\nAnsell and Vogel (this volume) argue that contested governance is particularly likely where \\nintense public scrutiny confronts an extensively institutionalized policy sector in which day -\\nto-day  routine  decisions  are  delegated  to  experts  or  administrators  with  little  on -going \\nattention or interest from the public.   \\n \\nThe second and related reason that supports an analysis of the interrelationship between the \\nabove  modes of failure relates to   the  three  \\u201eideal\\u201f  types  of  governance  modes:  markets, \\nnetworks and hierarchies (Thompson, Frances,  Levacic and Mitchell 1991).\\n15 Importantly, \\ntwo types of hierarchies can be distinguished here, the corporate hierarchy (large firms), and a \\ncountry\\u201fs  political  hierarchies.\\n16  This division  between governance modes is  particularly \\nrelevant here, since this chapter argues that a transparent and sharp distinction between the \\nroles of markets and political hierarchies is desirable in resolving contested governance with \\nregards to food safety .  The following sections explore these issues more explicitly, by \\nanalyzing the key dimensions of changes in  the political hierarchies in Germany,  and by \\nexamining changes in a market-led initiative, both of which aim  to address contestation in \\nfood safety matters. \\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n14 Fox and Peterson (2004) also emphasize the importance of cross-contamination of feed, in mills and on farms, \\nwhich is difficult to detect because of lack of reliable tests. \\n15 \\u201cThe key feature of networks \\u2026 is the way cooperation and trust are formed and sustained within networks. In \\ncontrast to either hierarchy or market, networks coordinate through less formal, more egalitarian and cooperative \\nmeans.\\u201d Thompson, et al. (1991: 18). \\n16 See Libecap (1992) for early evidence of the interrelationship between these hierarchies, as they were shaping \\nthe first federal food quality guarantees in the US (1887-1891).  \\n  11 \\n \\nA Voluntary National Quality Assurance Scheme: \\u201cQuality and Safety\\u201d (QS) \\n \\nThe shift in incentives for the German food demand chain to implement a large scale quality \\nassurance  scheme  after  the  BSE  events  is  a  further  reflection  of  the  shifting  balance  of \\nregulation, away from publicly mandated food safety regulations, more towards industry-led \\ninitiatives.\\n17  Several authors have explored gene ral incentive and adoption issues   of such \\nquality assurance schemes at the industry level (Henson and Caswell 1999; Caswell, Bredahl \\nand Hooker 1998).\\n18 However, given the scope of this chapter, the following sections attempt \\nto describe the functioning of  the QS scheme, highlight its actual and potential weaknesses, \\nand  explore  its broader relevance in the context of German food safety regulation   and \\ncontested governance. \\n \\nThe following discussion focuses on the new \\u201eQS\\u201f scheme, mainly for three reasons. First, in \\ncontrast to the limited coverage of other retailer-led schemes, the QS scheme reaches across \\nthe entire demand chain for meat, meat produce as well as fruit and vegetables.\\n19 Second, it \\ntakes an interesting intermediate position in terms of incentive provision to the food demand \\nchain, as it combines elements of a voluntary  industry-led quality assurance scheme and a \\npublicly mandated set of food safety regulations. Third, largely due to the composition of it \\nmembers, the cautious criticism of Minister K\\u00fcnast (Die Zeit 2003; Agrar.de 2003), and a \\n                                                 \\n17  See  Fearne,  Hornibrook  and  Dedman  (2001)  for  previous  retailer-led  beef  quality  assurance  schemes  in \\nGermany. \\n18 Buzby, Frenzen and Rasco (2001) consider the adverse consequences on firms that may result from market \\nforces (reputation, market share, revenue), food safety regulations (penalties) and product liability law (legal and \\ncompensation expenses). \\n19 A quality management system is in place in the dairy industry. The objective of the dairy industry is to align it \\nwith the QS system.  \\n  12 \\nrecent BSE-test scandal (Putz 2004) QS has become a focus of public debate that longs to be \\nviewed through the lense of contested governance. \\n \\nIn October 2001, representatives from the German farmers\\u201f federation, the federations of feed \\nprocessors,  meat  processors  and  retailers  joined  together  with  the  Central  Marketing \\nAssociation of German Agriculture (\\u201eCMA\\u201f), to form a limited liability corporation with the \\nobjective of establishing a national label and quality assurance scheme for conventionally \\nproduced meat and meat produce.\\n20 Each of the federations has a veto right and sends two \\nrepresentatives to an \\u201eadvising committee\\u201f, whose task is twofold. First, it sets the control \\ncriteria according to which independent auditors are asked to classify and accredit system \\nparticipants.\\n21 Second, it defines and  interprets the criteria according to which the assigned \\nlabel is set up and communicated to the outside world.  \\n \\nTwo further institutions were established, t he  \\u201esanctioning  committee\\u201f  and  the  \\u201eboard  of \\ntrustees\\u201f. The sanctioning committee consists of three members, a lawyer, a judge and an \\nexpert sworn to impartiality. This  committee rules over system participants that have  not \\nadhered  to  the  control  criteria,  established  by  the  advising  committee.  The  sanctioning \\ncommittee  imposes  penalties  according  to  guidelines  that  are  established  by  the  advising \\ncommittee.  The  other  institution  is  the  board  of  trustees,  whose  functions  lie  in  public \\nrelations  and  advising  the  sanctioning  committee.\\n22  In  order  to  reduce  a  centralized \\nadministrative  burden,  key  demand  chain  members,  such  as  coopera tives,  packers  and \\n                                                 \\n20 Most of the following factual information originates from the official website of QS: www.q-s.info/de \\n21 Auditors operate according to DIN 45011. \\n22 The board of trustees consists of twelve members. It is made up of academics, politicians, a union \\nrepresentative, a member from the German consumer association and a representative from the sugar industry.  \\n  13 \\nslaughterhouses  have  become  the  \\u201elocal  administrative  centers\\u201f  for  producers,  who  then \\nbecome \\u201eassociated producers\\u201f.  \\n \\nThe structure of controls of system participants can be characterized in terms of three steps: \\nthe firm-level self-control, an independent auditing and a control of the auditing. Currently \\nthis  control  of the auditing is  performed by the QS  corporation itself, or by  independent \\nauditors that are chosen by QS. Independent auditing occurs randomly, but auditors have to \\nannounce their visit at least one week in advance. The auditors check on physical criteria such \\nas hygiene and administrative criteria such as documentation. Some criteria are exclusion \\ncriteria,  but  after  passing  those,  each  farm  obtains  an  index  number.  Depending  on  the \\npercentage of criteria fulfilled, farms get classified as QS-standard-1, 2 or 3. There are several \\nincentive problems with this system. First, it is not made public into which QS-standard a \\nsystem participant (and thus his product) has been classified. Second, the auditing frequency \\ndiffers according to specie (higher for beef than for pork) and level of system participant (key \\ndistinction between farmers and \\u201elocal administrative centers\\u201f). For example, a pork producer \\nwho has been classified into QS-standard 1 has three years before he can expect the next \\nauditor on his farm (two years for QS-standard 2, and one year for QS-standard 3). Third, the \\nauditing frequency and stringency is particularly low at the retail level. As soon as more than \\n10 percent of retail outlets in a given chain have achieved a given QS-standard, this QS-\\nstandard will automatically be granted to all the remaining outlets. Once a retail chain has \\nbeen  granted QS-standard 1,  only 10  percent  of its  outlets  will be randomly selected for \\nauditing (15 percent annually for QS-standard 2 and 20 percent annually for QS-standard 3).   \\n  \\n  14 \\nGiven the inexperience with this type of quality assurance scheme, it is of interest to examine \\nthe practical implications for the alliance members further. Beyond the mandatory federal \\nrequirements in terms of documentation of origin and medication, the use of antibiotics is \\nmore strictly regulated under QS. Growth antibiotics were permitted for the production of \\npiglets and in the early fattening stages of pork production until January 2004. A total ban on \\ngrowth  antibiotics  has  since  been  implemented  throughout  the  lifecycle  of  all  animals. \\nHowever, the use of GM feedstuff as well as the use of fully slatted floors in pork production \\nis still permitted (Putz 2004). Another important implication for farmers is the compulsory \\nmonitoring of their salmonella status, exceeding the general mandatory federal regulations. \\nThe data about the salmonella status of an individual animal as well as a classification of the \\nentire  farm  is  fed  into  a  central  Salmonella  data  base.  From  there,  farmers  and \\nslaughterhouses can access the data. Initially sow herds were exempt so the coverage of the \\nSalmonella monitoring was incomplete until January 2004. \\n \\nTo emphasize, there are no implications and specifications at the farmgate or any other level \\nregarding  GMO\\u201fs  or  animal  welfare  criteria.  As  slaughterhouses,  processors  and  retailers \\nalready have to comply with federal regulation regarding traceability, there is no additional \\nimpact from QS.  \\n \\nSince the initiation of the QS system, the first certified produce appeared on the markets in \\nSeptember 2002, while the first meat under the new QS-label was sold by Walmart. Clearly, \\nthat was a message to all those who believed that QS would automatically guarantee higher \\nretail and producer prices.   \\n  15 \\n \\nHowever, for the first time in German history, a voluntary national quality assurance scheme \\nwas established. Since regulators are interested in the efficient provision of a desired level of \\nfood safety, this should be seen in a positive light as we need to consider economies of scale \\nassociated  with  safety-specific  capital.\\n23  With  QS,  as  with  other  schemes  of  vertical \\nintegration,  firms  can  obtain   the  necessary  minimum  efficient  scale  of  production . \\nNevertheless, QS has only achieved a limited coverage of the entire sector  with about  50 \\npercent of pork and 32 percent of beef produced under the QS label (October 2003). This is \\nsurprisingly low, given that QS originated as a result of safety problems in the beef sector. \\nBeginning  in early  2004  QS  auditing  had  also  started  in the fruit and vegetable sector . \\nFurthermore, system participants hope that QS will improve international competitiveness of \\nQS certified fruits and vegetables, since QS audits will be embedded in the global system of \\nEUREPGAP audits.\\n24 \\n \\nWith  the key objective of establishing a quality assurance scheme   that covers the entire \\nvertical supply chain based on HACCP principles, the QS scheme has achieved  standards \\nonly  slightly  greater  than  Germany\\u201fs  mandatory  standards:  its  criteria  rest  generally  on \\nexisting  mandatory  standards  and  are  only  distinct  in  terms  of  a  more  extensive  data \\nmanagement  system  (which  is  meant  to  improve  traceability)  and  increased  Salmonella \\n                                                 \\n23 This point deserves further emphasis since German meat production, particularly in pork, is characterized by \\nmuch smaller production units as compared to other European partners. Given the lack of large, homogenous \\nsupplies, this is likely to lead to further competitive pressure, as German processors and retailers are likely to \\nlook beyond the German border as soon as others have adopted QS standards. \\n24  Key specifics of EUREPGAP are: transparency, recognition of existing schemes and programmes v ia \\nBenchmarking and an easy to adopt Good Agricultural Practice protocol that is based on a master HACCP plan \\n(no full HACCP excersise at the farm gate).  \\n  16 \\nmonitoring. Along those criteria, QS fulfills the EU Food Safety Law 178/2002 in terms of \\ntraceability and self control. \\n \\nIn sum, what are the most critical points of the QS system? Given its limited coverage in \\nterms of total production, it appears that the system\\u201fs credibility remains limited as long as \\nthere is leeway for members of the supply chain to circumvent the system. More strikingly, \\nthe very reason for establishing the QS label does not appear to be taken seriously: according \\nto \\u201eFoodwatch\\u201f, an independently funded German organization for consumer's rights in the \\nfield of agricultural and food policy, nine German farms were identified where QS certified \\nbeef was not tested for BSE (Putz 2004). Furthermore, considering the institutional structure \\nof the QS system, the role of the \\u201esanctioning committee\\u201f appears questionable in two points. \\nFirst,  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  emerges  since  the  sanctioning  committee  imposes \\nsanctions according to guidelines that were established by the advising committee. Second, \\nand most importantly in the view of the declared objective of improving transparency, those \\nsystem members that violated the QS criteria and were punished with sanctions are not made \\npublic. Further, the lack of transparency with regards to the system participants\\u201f classification \\ninto QS-standards, and the low auditing frequency deserve to be emphasized again. Also, the \\nSalmonella  monitoring  scheme  is  insufficiently  rigorous,  as  there  are  no  bacteriological \\nexaminations  of  the  animals  required.\\n25  Problems  with  establishing  a  more  rigorous \\nSalmonella  monitoring  scheme  can  only  be  anticipated  from  the  fact  that  the  German \\ngovernment had previously led a voluntary national eradication and disease control program, \\nwhich was abandoned by the end of 1999 due to lack of participation. \\n                                                 \\n25 No judgement can be made regarding the actual status of infection; it is merely possible to judge whether an \\nanimal had contact with Salmonella in the past.  \\n  17 \\n \\nSome critical issues extend further to the butchers and the retailers. The butchers\\u201f association \\nhas refused to join the label, based on two points. First, butchers argue that the additional \\ncompliance costs will not be counterbalanced by a higher consumers\\u201f willingness to pay. \\nSecond, the butchers believe that  their quality standards  are already  above QS  standards. \\nResults from a recent study (Loy and Steiner 2004) suggest that butchers have indeed been \\nable  to  charge  higher  prices  as  compared  to  supermarkets.\\n26  As  several  studies  have \\nconfirmed, German consumers appear to value the \\u201epersonal relationship\\u201f with a butcher more \\nthan placing their trust in an \\u201eanonymous label\\u201f (Nielsen 1998; Wirz 1996). The fact that \\nbutchers have not joined the QS system, although they currently account for about 40 percent \\nof meat sales in Germany, could therefore be regarded as a further indication of the inability \\nof the QS corporation to communicate the label\\u201fs benefits to consumers, beyond those that are \\nconveyed through the current mandatory standards.  \\n \\nFurther, consider the retail level. The QS scheme started as a retailer-led quality assurance \\nscheme, with its first meat being sold through Walmart. Many producers and food processors \\nwere thus  implicitly forced to  adopt QS  standards,  or lose their outlets. Clearly, with an \\nincreasing concentration at the retail level, it is important to keep antitrust issues in mind. \\n \\nIn total, and accounting for the now tightened standards as compared to the initialization \\nstage, QS appears to have slightly lifted the overall level of food safety beyond the current \\nmandatory state regulations. However, it appears striking that a quality assurance scheme was \\n                                                 \\n26 Also, in the wake of the 1996 BSE crisis in Germany, they appear to have been able to adopt a more consistent \\npricing strategy, as reflected in a lower price variability (Loy and Steiner 2004).  \\n  18 \\nput into place with little rigor first, before more stringent measures were adopted. This may be \\nrational with regards to minimizing system participants\\u201f initial compliance costs. But it is \\nunlikely to be a successful long-term strategy with regards to regaining consumer confidence \\nand market share. Consider that at present, the QS label appears to carry a low informational \\nvalue, since it is difficult to communicate to consumers the differences between the QS label \\nand the required standards objectively. Beyond the complexity of the underlying standards, a \\nlow consumer valuation is also anticipated due to a continuing lack of consumer trust. This is \\nnot only due to the fact that most of the information about QS originates from its system \\nmembers,  but  also  because  German  consumers  continue  to  be  surprised  by  undesirable \\nsubstances  in  the  food  demand  chain  (May  2002:  Nitrofen  in  organic  wheat,  July  2003: \\nDioxin in feedstuff).  \\n \\nNevertheless, due to its broader scope and larger scale than previous small-scale industry-led \\nquality  assurance  schemes,  the  implicitly  improved  standard  harmonization  could,  in \\nprinciple, be seen in a positive light for consumers. Consumer choice could be improved due \\nto the reduction in the complexity of labeling and standards information.  However, due to the \\ngreater  comparability  of  standards,  transparency  is  likely  to  lead  to  greater  competitive \\npressure on other sector participants to differentiate themselves. A continuing proliferation of \\ndomestic  and  international  retailer  or  producer  led  quality  assurance  schemes  could  be \\nexpected to appear on the German market in the future. Consumer gains could thus be with \\nregards to price, but whether consumers gain in terms of information provision is likely to be  \\n  19 \\ndetermined by how industry players and the government find a balance between standards \\nregulation and label proliferation.\\n27 \\n \\nFurther, since  QS system participants have developed the Salmonella monitoring system  \\nbased on the European Parliament\\u201fs regulation on the control of Salmonella, QS is likely to \\nserve  as  basis  for  a  faster  and  more  efficient  introduction  of  the  expected  mandatory \\nregulation.\\n28 In future, it  should also guarantee a smoother compliance with the proposed \\nEuropean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)  (COM 2003/0174, 16.9.2003). \\nBeyond the Salmonella criteria in QS, it is also the establishment of a central Salmonella data \\nbase that anticipates forthcoming EU regulation with regards to traceability, and should thus \\nbee  seen  in  a  positive  light .\\n29  Given  these  potential  harmonization  benefits,  i t  will  be \\ninteresting to continue to observe the forthcoming governance interplay between political and \\ncorporate hierarchies, especially after the recent reform of federal ministries and regulations \\nin Germany. \\n \\nThe Reform of Food Safety Regulation in Germany \\n \\nThe most visible change in governance that can be associated with food safety issues relates \\nto the renaming of the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry to the Federal \\nMinistry of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture (BMVEL) in January 2001. This \\n                                                 \\n27 Consider also that the German government does not intend to replace QS by any national set of regulations \\n(BMVEL 2003). \\n28 See directive 2001/0176 (COD) and 2001/0177 (COD), as in COM(2003) 434, 16.7.2003. \\n29 EU Food Safety Law 178/2002 has taken effect on the 1st January 2005.  \\n  20 \\noccurred  only  one  day  after  the  federal  minister  for  health  and  the  federal  minister  for \\nagriculture were forced to resign. \\n \\nThe  following  section  outlines  the  changes  in  governance  structure  before  attempting  an \\nassessment of these reforms. Throughout, this section will relate to a study of the German \\ncourt of auditors, which was initiated by Chancellor Schr\\u00f6der at the end of 2000 (\\u201evon Wedel \\nreport\\u201f;  von  Wedel  2001).  This  127  page  report,  which  was  published  in  July  2001,  is \\nparticularly insightful for two reasons. First, its editor was the president of the German federal \\ncourt of auditors and, at the same time, the federal commissioner for operating efficiency in \\npublic administration.\\n30 Second, the report came about with the cooperation of experts of the \\ncourt  of  auditors ,  the  BMVEL,  as  well  as  an  advising  committee  that  consisted  of \\nrepresentatives from farmers, consumers groups and science. \\n \\nThe re-naming of the ministry into the BMVEL had an i mmediate structural consequence. \\nThe Federal Ministry for Consumer Protection (BgVV) was placed under the jurisdiction of \\nthe BMVEL and finally dissolved in November 2002. The BgVV\\u201fs responsibilities were then \\ntaken over by three federal institutions: The BMVEL, the newly created federal institute of \\nrisk assessment (BfR) and the newly created federal office for consumer protection and food \\nsafety (BVL), both of which were created in November 2002. As will be discussed in more \\ndetail below, the BfR is responsible for risk analysis, risk communication to policy makers \\nand  the  public,  and  cooperation  with  the  European  Food  Safety  Authority  (EFSA) \\n(Agrarbericht 2003). Risk management responsibilities (including the admission of pesticides) \\n                                                 \\n30 Since January 2002 Dr. von Wedel is member of the European court of auditors.  \\n  21 \\nand the coordination of joint control functions between the Federation and the federal states \\nwere taken over by the BVL. The reform of these institutions has very much followed the \\nblueprint of the von Wedel report.\\n31 \\n \\nThe report\\u201fs criticism focuses on three traits of the previous scope of governance. These are \\nthe fragmentation of food safety related responsibilities across Federal ministries, the lack of \\nan independent scientific center advising the BMVEL, and the lack of coordination between \\nthe Federation, the federal states and the EU in matters of food safety. \\n \\nFragmentation of responsibilities \\n \\nAfter the immediate reorganization of the BMVEL in January 2000 there were still food \\nsafety  related  tasks  for  which  the  BMU  (Federal  Ministry  for  the  environment,  nature \\nconservation  and  nuclear  safety),  the  BMWI  (Federal  ministry  for  the  economy  and \\ntechnology) and the BMG (Federal Ministry of Health) were responsible. The von Wedel \\nreport found that there were eighteen subordinate Federal institutes engaged in food safety \\nmatters. In order to address this fragmentation, lack of coordination and in response to the \\nChancellor\\u201fs intention that food safety matters should be concentrated within the BMVEL, the \\nreport contained two main suggestions. First, food safety tasks should be bundled within the \\nBMVEL after a reorganized working structure of its departments. Second, a complete reform \\nof  the  central  policy  department  within  the  BMVEL  was  proposed  to  account  for  future \\nstrategic issues such as policy planning, coordination in research, and coordination in EU \\n                                                 \\n31 Following the von Wedel report, a working group on the \\u201ereorganization of consumer health protection\\u201f was \\nconvened in the BMVEL and published its findings and proposals in December 2001 (BMVEL 2001).  \\n  22 \\nmatters. While the bundling of food safety responsibilities has taken shape in the current \\nBMVEL, the second proposal of the von Wedel report has not yet been implemented. \\n \\nEstablishment of an independent scientific center for risk analysis \\n \\nWithin the structure of the previously established Federal ministries, there was no scope for \\ninterdisciplinary risk analysis related to food safety. Therefore the von Wedel report proposed \\nthe establishment of such a center with the following tasks: (1) collect, analyze and evaluate \\ninformation on food risk (risk analysis and risk communication) in order to provide \\u201eobjective \\nand  preventative  policy  advice\\u201f,  (2)  serve  as  an  intermediary  between  the  BMVEL  and \\nnational and international research institutes, (3) serve as representative vis a vis the European \\nFood  Safety  Authority  (EFSA).  The  report  recommended  that  this  center  be  part  of  the \\nBMVEL (in budgetary terms, with an independent governing status), that it have the power to \\ncontract research projects out, and guaranteed independence through similar principles and \\nmeasures that rule for the Deutsche Bundesbank. Given the unresolved budgetary issue and \\nfaced with the difficult task of overcoming principal-agent (incentive) problems that would \\nunderlie such an \\u201eassociated center\\u201f, it is not surprising that this part of the proposal has not \\nbeen put into practice in its original form.  \\n \\nThe Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) in its current form considers itself as the \\nscientific body of the Federal Republic of Germany in matters of food safety. It has the legal \\nform of a self-governing public institution, which is meant to provide the necessary scientific \\nindependence. The BfR aims to prepare expert reports and opinions on questions of food  \\n  23 \\nsafety and consumer health protection on the basis of internationally recognized scientific \\nassessment criteria (BfR 2003). With the help of risk analyses, the BfR aims to formulate \\naction options for risk reduction. The tasks of the BfR include the provision of scientific \\nadvice to federal ministries concerned with food safety matters, and the publication of original \\nresearch and risk assessments to the public, in a transparent and comprehensible manner.\\n32 \\nFurther, the BfR is engaged in scientific cooperation with other international institutions and \\norganizations that are involved in consumer health protection and food safety. The BfR takes \\na role which more closely resembles that of AFSSA in F rance (see Besan\\u00e7on et al., this \\nvolume), since its role as a public body for risk assessment is strictly separated from risk \\nmanagement. This contrasts with the UK reforms, where risk assessment, management and \\ncommunication functions are combined within the FSA (see Rothstein, this volume). \\n \\nAddressing the lack of coordination at the national and EU level \\n \\nIn anticipation of the foundation of the EFSA, the von Wedel report focused on organizational \\nweaknesses at the level of the Federation as well as on the division of responsibilities between \\nfederal states and the Federation. In the past, the Federation was only partly responsible with \\nregards to food safety matters. The responsibility was limited to the creation of laws at the \\nlevel of the federation, as well as to cooperating responsibilities with EU institutions. Given \\nGermany\\u201fs constitution, the central role of the federal states was and still is in the sphere of \\nexecution (monitoring food quality, feedstuff and the private veterinary sector). In order to \\nfulfill the joint tasks of the Federation and the federal states in terms of risk management, risk \\n                                                 \\n32 \\u201cThe assessment results will, in principle, be made publicly accessible whilst maintaining the confidentiality \\nof protected data.\\u201d BfR (2003).  \\n  24 \\nevaluation and risk communication, the von Wedel report suggested the creation of a more \\noutput-oriented \\u201ecoordinating agency of the Federation\\u201f (KSB).  Created in  its  governance \\nstructure  as  a  mirror  image  to  EU  governance  structures,  this  KSB  has  been  established \\nthrough  the  BVL  (federal  office  for  consumer  protection  and  food  safety).  Its  associated \\nresponsibilities lie in  the establishment  of a central  internal  data network  for food safety \\nissues and harmonization of control standards and crisis management, such that the KSB \\nfunctions as intercept for the European Rapid Alert System. However, two very appropriate \\nrecommendations  of the  von Wedel  report have not  been followed so  far  - that the data \\ncollected through the KSB be made public and that the KSB be used as a mechanism for \\nexploring the legal appropriateness of existing liability laws.\\n 33 \\n \\nBeyond the reform of the BMVEL and its related institutions, the Government has enacted \\nseveral other initiatives. On August 6, 2002, a law for the \\u201enew organization of consumer \\nhealth protection and food safety\\u201f was passed in the upper house of the federal government. \\nThis legislation establishes the BfR and the BVL and re-labels the pesticide regulation, the \\nepidemic regulation and the feedstuff regulation to conform with the newly labeled BMVEL. \\nIn 2003, the government has also invested about $13 million Dollars to support the national \\nresearch initiative on TSE (Transmissible spongiforme Enzephalopathien). In addition, the \\ngovernment has reformed liability laws by integrating consumer rights into the BGB (the \\nGerman civil code), making it easier for consumers to sue individual firms, and for consumer \\ngroups to sue associations. \\n                                                 \\n33 \\u201eIm Auftrag des Bundesministeriums f\\u00fcr Verbraucherschutz in Bonn ist zwar eine ganze Abteilung damit \\nbesch\\u00e4ftigt, herauszufinden, wann wo welches Tier erkrankte und womit es gef\\u00fcttert wurde.

In the future, consumer protection in these sensitive areas of \\nagricultural and food policy will be given priority over economic \\ninterests.\\u201d\\n34 \\n \\nIn an attempt to explore the issue of remaining contestation in the above context and in the \\nsense  of  Ansell  and  Vogel  (this  volume),  it  appears  necessary  to  ask  which  traits  of  the \\nreformed scope of governance can be linked to continuing public distrust in authority that \\nchallenges the legitimacy of existing institutional arrangements. This chapter suggests that the \\nlack of the following governance traits as related to food safety can be used to reflect upon \\nthis issue: \\n \\nCompetence\\n35 \\n \\n\\uf0b7  the capacity to select and replace ill-founded food safety policy instruments \\n\\uf0b7  the capacity to design and implement well-founded food safety policy instruments \\n(e.g. the capacity to judge whether risk is acceptable or not) \\n                                                 \\n34  \\u201cDer  BSE-Skandal  markiert  das  Ende  der  Landwirtschaftspolitik  alten  Typs.  In  Zukunft  hat  der \\nVerbraucherschutz in diesen sensiblen Bereichen der Agrar- und Ern\\u00e4hrungspolitik Vorrang vor wirtschaftlichen \\nInteressen.\\u201d (Agrarbericht 2001). \\n35 Williamson (1998) differentiates governance structures in terms of their cost and competence.  \\n  26 \\n \\nAccountability \\n \\n\\uf0b7  the aptness of institutions to respond to changing demands and insights from citizens \\n(democratic accountability from within) \\n\\uf0b7  the readiness of governing institutions to respond to evolving scientific knowledge and \\nfeedback from other democratic institutions (external democratic accountability) \\n\\uf0b7  external and internal accountability require transparency: only when the operation of \\ngovernance structures is transparent  can a critical  flow of information  be returned \\nfrom citizens and science to the institutions themselves \\n \\nA further issue that is not covered in the above view of competence and accountability, yet \\nemerges in the context of Germany\\u201fs federal system is the characterization of governance in \\nterms of centralization vs. decentralization, and its effect on the competence of governance. It \\nappears that the reduction in fragmentation of food safety related responsibilities through the \\nestablishment  of  the  BMVEL  in  its  current  form  has  led  to  a  more  competent  scope  of \\ngovernance. \\n \\nFurther,  with  the  established  separation  of  risk  management  from  risk  analysis  and  risk \\ncommunication through the BfR and BVL (which mirrors European governance structures as \\nimplemented  in  the  EU  Food  Safety  Law  178/2002),  accountability  has  also  been,  in \\nprincipal, improved.  \\n  \\n  27 \\nRegarding transparency, this chapter has stressed the lack of it on several occasions above, \\nincluding in the context of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). This may prove to \\nbe  the  greatest  weakness  in  terms  of  improving  the  food  industry\\u201fs  and  government\\u201fs \\naccountability.  \\n \\nIn  sum,  it  appears  that  contestation  in  food  safety  matters  has  been  reduced  today  when \\njudged  in  terms  of  competence  and  accountability.  Initially,  and  following  the  decree  of \\nChancellor  Schr\\u00f6der  for  organizational  reform  in  January  2001,  a  mere  re-bundling  of \\nresponsibilities  has  been  observed,  without  effective  reform  efforts  related  to  food  safety \\nissues.\\n36 Largely due to the von Wedel report, which was initiated by the Chancellor himself, \\nthis temporary peak in  politicization has subdued. However, only the  emergence of critical \\nsafety situations will prove how accountable and competent the governance structure  will \\nremain.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n36  \\u201cEs  unterblieb  eine  umfassende  interne  Reorganisation,  mit  der  Anliegen  des  gesundheitlichen \\nVerbraucherschutzes entsprechend ihrer politischen Bedeutung geb\\u00fcndelt worden w\\u00e4ren.\\u201c (von Wedel, 2001: \\n27).  \\n  28 \\nEffectiveness and efficiency in a changing scope of governance \\n \\nThe following section attempts a brief assessment of effectiveness and allocative efficiency as \\nit relates to the current scope of governance in food safety matters.  \\n \\nEffectiveness \\nIn  order  to  consider  the  effectiveness  of  the  reformed  institutions  more  explicitly,  the \\nfollowing criteria are employed: \\n \\n(i)  achievement of goals inherent in the implemented regulations and policies \\n(ii)  appropriateness of regulatory burden in its context \\n(iii) facilitation of verification and traceability  \\n(iv)   strengthening of liability law \\n \\n(i) The von Wedel report has established the fragmentation of the old Ministry of Agriculture \\nas one of the main deficiencies to be resolved. Since the goals of the report were, in this \\nrespect, put largely into practice, it appears that the current governance structure represents a \\nmajor \\u2013 though overdue \\u2013 improvement. However, without knowledge of the time allocation \\nof individual ministries and branches on food safety related aspects and the corresponding \\nachievement of specific goals, it is difficult to provide further judgement. \\n \\n(ii) Given the bundling of responsibilities and the reduction in fragmentation, the regulatory \\nburden through multiple and overlapping governance structures is likely to be reduced. The  \\n  29 \\nestablishment  of  the  BfR  is  important  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of  food  safety \\nregulations through conducting and promoting research in general, and through the use of \\ncost-benefit analysis in particular. Since it is currently unknown to what extent the BfR uses \\ncost-benefit analyses in the regulatory process (no such information has been made public on \\ntheir website until June 2005), only the observed promotion of research and the associated \\nestablishment of a data network hints to an improvement in terms of regulatory effectiveness. \\nNevertheless, the above caveat in terms of lacking data transparency looms large.  \\n \\n(iii) The government\\u201fs attempt to establish a voluntary Salmonella monitoring scheme that \\nensures  traceability  and  facilitates  verification  has  failed.  Instead,  traceability  has  been \\nachieved through the QS\\u201fs Salmonella monitoring and the central Salmonella data base. \\n \\n(iv) Finally, with regards to producers, consumers and consumer groups, liability rules have \\nbeen improved.  \\n \\nEfficiency \\n \\nEfficient governance mechanisms are those which align incentive problems between agents \\nthat  frequently  occur  due  to  the  separation  of  ownership  and  control  (Williamson  1998). \\n\\u201eGood governance\\u201f aims thus to align incentive problems in order to permit the realization of \\n(mutual) gains between agents. There are several ways by which the achievement of such \\ngains  may  be  hampered.  In  the  face  of  the  previously  discussed  changes  in  scope  of \\ngovernance, this section will briefly focus on issues of authority, liability and risk.   \\n  30 \\n \\nAuthority, decentralization and efficiency \\n \\nAs Aghion and Tirole (1997) emphasize, a gain in terms of efficiency can be made by giving \\nup  some  control,  i.e.  giving  away  real  authority,  although  formal  control  remains  top \\npriority.\\n37 Considering the stricter bundling of food safety related tasks at the Federal level, \\nthe improved communication between Federal ministries due to the reduction in overlap of \\nresponsibilities, together with a more transparent decentralized federal governance structure, \\nit is likely that the current governance structure is more efficient than previous ones. \\n \\nLiability and the provision of information \\n \\nFrom an efficiency point of view, it is desirable to use food safety regulation and liability \\nrules jointly in order to control for risk related to food safety hazards (Shavell 1984; Skogh \\n1989;  Antle  1995).\\n38  Although  an  improved  regulation  of  the  provision  of  risk -related \\ninformation helps to assure and preserve consumers\\u201f freedom of choice, informational failures \\nneed to be addressed through standards and liability.\\n39  Since 2001 we observe tighter liability \\nrules that should strengthen deterrence. Together with an improvement of risk assessment, \\ncommunication and management that appears to have been made (through the establishment \\nof the BfR and the BVL), it is likely that the balance between regulation and liability has been \\n                                                 \\n37 Aghion and Tirole (1997) focus on a moral hazard setting (agents can take actions that are unobserved to \\nothers) with costly monitoring, which appears most suited in the present context. \\n38 When it is inefficient to address market failures through tort liability, there is need for regulation. \\n39 Issues related to inadequate and asymmetric information (credence qualities) have been discussed above. \\nLiability can be shared, in a hierarchy, or it can be shifted among agents, each of which has different efficiency \\nimplications. Sunding and Zilberman (1998) analyze the case of shifting liability among firms and consumers, \\nwhen agents follow what are perceived to be reasonable actions that result in accidental injury.   \\n  31 \\nimproved.\\n40  So far,  considering information made public through the internet,   it is not \\napparent that much risk-related research has been performed in relation to food safety matters. \\nIt appears that, in striving for more efficient risk regulation, the BfR should address important \\nissues,  such  as:  how  do  consumers  respond  to  different  communication  efforts  of  the \\ngovernment,  and how  does  consumers\\u201f  capacity  to  use  differently  formatted  information \\nvary?\\n41  \\n \\nIn sum, the reformed food safety regulation appears suited to improve efficiency through the \\nemphasis on information provision, standards and  transparency, as these help to safeguard \\nconsumers\\u201f freedom of choice.\\n42 Since we observe some improvements in liability law and \\nstandards  regulation,  and  would  expect  that  fewer  resources  are  needed  to  achieve  the \\nacclaimed  risk-related  goals  in  the newly reformed governance  structure, efficiency  gains \\nshould be observed. Nevertheless, the lack of deterrence due to the reduction in potential \\nliability that comes with the limited publication of risk data is likely to hamper efficiency (it is \\nalso in this sense that QS is inefficient by not publishing firms that defected). \\n \\n                                                 \\n40  With  \\u201etightened\\u201f  liability  it  will  be  more  feasible  to  sue  with  lower  transaction  costs.  Further,  the  legal \\ninstruments will be more suited to provide deterrence, assuming that firms correctly anticipate the compensation \\nwhich would be imposed by the legal rules (Viscusi, 1989a). An improvement of liability rules along those lines \\nwill, through the reduction of transaction costs, help to ensure that a level of food safety is provided that is \\nsocially optimal. Consider that lower transaction costs may also be achieved through the court system itself, due \\nto clearer liability rulings. \\n41  Viscusi and Magat (1992) discuss the conditions under which different types of information provision \\ninstruments are effective. Just, Wolf, Wu and Zilberman (2002) extend existing models of value of information \\nby incorporating consideration of individu als\\u201f varying capacity to use differently formatted information and \\nvariation in their information needs. \\n42 The current refusal of the QS system to make the Salmonella status public could also be seen in this light: if \\nthe  Salmonella  status  is  disclosed,  co nsumers  could  overestimate  the  uncertain  outcome  of  contracting \\nSalmonellosis with a certain probability. The level of meat demand would thus be suboptimal. However, a \\ntransparent system means also that scientists and the media have a role in transmitting  the information to \\nconsumers such that these market failures can be averted.  \\n  32 \\nRisk standards, cost-benefit analysis and the issue of risk perception \\n \\nWhen risk standards (standards to protect health) are used for choosing between different food \\nsafety regulations, a major concern is that the costs of different policy options may not enter \\ninto the design of risk standards, and standard setting is likely to reflect evidence of risk \\nbiases and responsiveness to political factors (Viscusi and Hamilton 1999). This calls for the \\nuse of cost-benefit analysis. Furthermore, since governance decisions at the federal level need \\nto account for private efforts to ensure food safety (QS), cost-benefit analysis should be used \\nto facilitate the identification of effective intervention points in the food demand chain, and \\nthe identification of efficient mixes of mandatory and voluntary quality management systems \\n(Unnevehr and Roberts 1997; Caswell 1998).\\n43 The general importance and pitfalls of cost-\\nbenefit analysis for regulatory decision making are well established (Nichols 1991; Arrow, et \\nal. 1996). But importantly with regards to food safety, s tandard cost-benefit has also been \\nrefined to take account of scientific uncertainty, in ways that balance the Precautionary \\nPrinciple against the benefits of waiting  to learn before taking action (Gollier 2001).\\n44 This \\nraises three issues related to the legitimacy of the BfR, the BVL and the governance reforms \\nas such. First, since it is unknown, at this stage, to what extent the BfR makes use of cost -\\nbenefit analyses, it is difficult to judge how efficient the operations of the BfR and BVL are \\nalong these lines (there are no publications that reveal its actual use, although the BfR \\nproclaims  that  it  is  \\u201edeveloping  concepts\\u201f  for  cost-benefit  analysis).  Second,  from  the \\npublished information it is not known to what extent the Precautionary Principle is actually \\n                                                 \\n43 See Unnevehr and Roberts (1997) for a discussion of cost-benefit analysis in the context of microbial food \\nsafety.  \\n44 The Precautionary Principle asserts that uncertainty should never be used as a reason for postponing risk-\\nprevention efforts (Gollier 2001).  \\n  33 \\nintegrated into cost-benefit research at the BfR. Third, even if this done, it is not evident what \\nrole  the  Precautionary  Principle  takes  as  part  of  the  reformed  food  safety  regulations. \\nHowever,  in  providing  reformed  institutional  arrangements  that  reduce  distrust  in  public \\nauthority and thus reduce challenges to legitimacy, the specification of a clear and transparent \\nrole of the Precautionary Principle in a newly emerging scope of governance should be given \\na high priority. \\n \\nGiven  consumers\\u201f  different  capacity  and  thus  efficiency  of  using  various  forms  of \\ninformation, it is to be expected that consumer heterogeneity will pose further challenges to \\nthe  work  of  the  BfR  and  the  BVL.\\n45  Since German consumers have proved to be more \\nsensitive  than other  European  consumers  with  regards to  food  safety   scandals  and  the \\nprovision of food safety information, consumer heterogeneity and  the resulting problem of \\nefficient allocation of risks should be part of the BfR\\u201fs research agenda. An interdisciplinary \\nresearch effort appears particularly appropriate, just as the von Wedel report has suggested, \\nsince this is likely to help in analyses to adjust the subjective risk to the objective one.\\n46 \\nFuture research could control for these aspects by taking advantage of the strengths of choice \\nexperiments from surveys, combining it with market data (Louviere  et al.1999; Louviere, \\nHensher and Swait 2000). \\n \\nIn sum, risk research should not degenerate to a governance marketing effort that aims at \\nreducing perceived risk associated with search, experience and credence attributes. Rather, a \\n                                                 \\n45 It is well known that it is important to account for the endogeneity of risk: consumers differ in their marginal \\nproductivity of self-protection (Ehrlich and Becker 1972; Shogren and Crocker 1999).  \\n46 See Viscusi (1989b) for analyses that account explicitly for the relationship between consumers\\u201f perception of \\nrisk and actual risk.  \\n  34 \\nmultidisciplinary research effort on risk perception is important for an efficient design of \\ngovernance  structures  and  a  regaining  of  institutional  legitimacy,  since  knowledge  of \\nperceived risk helps to rationalize and de-politicize risk assessment and those governance \\noptions which both the BfR and BVL have on their agenda. In doing this, those interested in \\neffectiveness and efficiency of the evolving scope of governance in Germany may wish to \\nconsider Viscusi\\u201fs findings as their paradigm: \\n \\nAs in the case of risk perception biases, the most disturbing aspect \\nof these potential market failures is that the government policies \\nintended to eliminate the shortcomings often appear to be driven \\nby the same set of influences.\\u201d (Kip Viscusi, 1990: 261) \\n \\n \\nConclusion \\n \\nSix weeks  after the  first  BSE case emerged in Germany the foundations  were laid  for  a \\nsweeping  reform  of  governance  structures  related  to  food  safety:  within  48  hrs  both  the \\nminister of health and the minister of agriculture were forced to resign, and a lawyer and \\nmember of the green party became head of the former Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture \\nand Forestry.  The ministry was simultaneously re-named the Federal Ministry of Consumer \\nProtection, Food and Agriculture. This chapter has tried to explore an emerging mix of market \\nand government initiatives in Germany with regards to food safety, as exemplified by an \\nindustry led, voluntary national quality assurance scheme (\\u201cQuality and Safety\\u201d, \\u201eQS\\u201f) and  \\n  35 \\nthe reform of federal level governance structures involved in food safety issues. Since both \\nmandatory regulations and markets, through reputation and competition, can serve to provide \\nappropriate incentives and constraints with regards to food safety matters to actors in the food \\nindustry, the functioning and implications of QS were considered together with the reforms of \\ngovernance structures at the ministerial level. \\n \\nBefore the actual changes in the different aspects of governance were discussed, an attempt \\nwas made to explore the key elements of scope of governance, i.e. structure, control and \\nprocess, together with the evolving mix of types of governance modes in a more general \\ncontext. This permits a clearer assessment of governance elements that follows with regards \\nto aspects of competence, accountability, effectiveness and efficiency. In turn, it enables us to \\nexplore the extent to which the changing scope of governance faces ongoing public distrust \\nthat challenges the legitimacy of those newly reformed institutional arrangements (Ansell and \\nVogel, this volume). \\n \\nFollowing a review of the QS scheme, it appears that the initiative has lifted the overall level \\nof food safety only slightly above the one supplied by the current mandatory state regulations. \\nThis is largely due to an attempt to implement a more rigorous Salmonella monitoring system \\nand the need to satisfy all members of the demand chain that participate in the QS system. A \\nlow informational value of the label is asserted, also since it is difficult to communicate to \\nconsumers  the  differences  between  the  QS  label  and  the  generally  required  mandatory \\nstandards  objectively.  But  beyond  the  complexity  of  the  underlying  standards,  a  low \\nconsumer valuation is also expected due to a continuing lack of consumer trust. Public distrust  \\n  36 \\nhas only recently received a boost due to allegations of failures in BSE testing (Putz 2004). \\nHowever, given the broader scope and larger scale of the QS scheme compared to previous \\nindustry-led  quality  assurance  schemes,  the  implicitly  improved  standard  harmonization \\nshould, in principle, be seen in a positive light with regards to consumer information and \\nconsumer choice. Nevertheless, it appears that in practice, the standard harmonization has \\ntaken place at such a low level that those informational gains to consumers are outbalanced by \\nthe fact that the QS label masks shortcomings that are likely to be unanticipated by consumers \\n(neither GM feedstuff nor animal welfare criteria are currently part of the QS certification; the \\nauditing  procedures  are  not  stringent  enough  to  be  effective).  As  a  result,  diminishing \\nconsumer trust may spill over to other existing or forthcoming labeling schemes. \\n \\nHowever,  since  QS  system  participants  have  developed  a  Salmonella  monitoring  system \\nbased on the European Parliament\\u201fs regulation on the control of salmonella, QS could serve \\nas basis for a faster and more efficient introduction of the forthcoming mandatory regulation \\nat the EU level. In future, the QS scheme should also guarantee a smoother compliance with \\nthe proposed European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). But beyond the \\nSalmonella  criteria  in  QS,  it  is  also  the  establishment  of  a  central  data  base  and  thus \\ntraceability which is anticipating forthcoming EU regulation.  \\n \\nIn sum, the introduction of QS appears to have brought little, if any, immediate consumer \\ngains in terms of improving consumer choice and information, yet its pioneering character \\nand large scope across the food demand system appears to have brought some gains with \\nregards  to  the  implementation  of  future  institutional  and  regulatory  changes.  Since  the  \\n  37 \\nGerman  government  must  ultimately  defend  itself  in  terms  of  traceability  measures  and \\nSalmonella monitoring vis a vis the EU, these regulatory gains from QS may in future help to \\nreduce contested governance in the interplay between market-led and government-led food \\nsafety initiatives. \\n \\nThe  chapter  goes  on  to  explore  governance  changes  with  regards  to  the  restructuring  of \\nGerman Federal ministries and the government\\u201fs initiatives with regards to liability issues and \\ninformation  provision.  Along  with  the  criticism  and  reform  proposals  of  a  report  of  the \\nGerman court of auditors, the chapter considers three aspects of the scope of governance \\nbefore 2000, which are all relevant to exploring the extent of distrust in public authority and \\nthe legitimacy of the underlying institutional arrangements. First, the fragmentation of food \\nsafety related responsibilities across Federal ministries, second, the lack of scientific advice \\nand research that links more directly with the Ministry of agriculture, and third, the lack of \\ncoordination between the Federation, the federal states and the EU in matters of food safety. \\nAccounting for the most recent governance changes, it appears that the governance in food \\nsafety matters is less contested in the sense of Ansell and Vogel (this volume), and as judged \\nin terms of competence and accountability. Given the bundling of responsibilities and the \\nreduction in fragmentation that has taken place, the regulatory burden is also likely to be \\nreduced.  \\n \\nWith the establishment of the federal institute of risk assessment (BfR) and the federal office \\nfor consumer protection and food safety (BVL) in November 2002, a credible attempt is made \\nto separate risk analysis and risk communication from risk management. This approach is  \\n  38 \\nsimilar to the developments in France with the introduction of AFFSA (see Besan\\u00e7on et al., \\nthis  volume),  but  differs  sharply  from  the  UK  approach,  in  which  risk  assessment, \\nmanagement and communication are combined within the FSA (see Rothstein, this volume). \\nThe  creation  of  the  BfR  is  important  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of  food  safety \\nregulations  through  conducting  original  research  and  promoting  research  in  general,  and \\nthrough the use of cost-benefit analysis in particular. Since it is currently unknown to what \\nextent the BfR uses cost-benefit analyses in the regulatory process, only the promotion of \\nresearch  and  the  associated  establishment  of  a  data  network  suggests  that  regulatory \\neffectiveness is likely to be improved. Also, liability rules have been improved for producers, \\nconsumers  and  consumer  groups.  Nevertheless,  lacking  transparency  with  regards  to  data \\naccess to the outside world remains a problem. \\n \\nFinally,  this  chapter  attempts  to  make  a  brief  efficiency  assessment  of  the  emerging \\ngovernance structures. Considering a more focused and decentralized division of authority \\ntogether with tighter liability rules that should strengthen deterrence, the governance reform \\npromises efficiency gains. Together with an improvement of tasks related to risk analysis, \\ncommunication and management, it is likely that the balance between regulation and liability \\nhas been improved. Further, the reformed food safety regulations appear suited to improve \\nefficiency through the emphasis on information provision, standards and traceability, as these \\nhelp to safeguard consumers\\u201f freedom of choice. Nevertheless, the lack in deterrence due to \\nthe reduction in potential liability that comes with the limited publication of risk data is likely \\nto hamper efficiency.  \\n  \\n  39 \\nAlso, the recent and repeated defeat of the government\\u201fs \\u201einformation law\\u201f for consumers at \\nthe upper house of parliament must be seen as a setback for restoring trust in public authority. \\nFurther, extensive consumer consultation, as it is practiced in the UK through a dedicated \\nconsumer  consultive  committee  (see  Rothstein,  this  volume)  is  also  largely  missing  in \\npractice, although the BfR proclaims risk communication as an interactive process and dialog. \\nThese  two  conditions  are  all  the  more  important  with  regards  to  continuing  contested \\ngovernance, since effective risk communication is essential for building credibility, trust in \\npublic authority and thus enhancing the legitimacy of institutional arrangements.  \\n \\nIn view of the danger that the costs of different policy options may not enter into the design of \\nrisk  standards,  and  that  standard  setting  is  likely  to  reflect  evidence  of  risk  biases  and \\nresponsiveness to political factors, this chapter suggests that cost-benefit analysis should be \\nimplemented at various stages in the planning and decision making process of German food \\nsafety regulations. It is currently not evident whether or to what extent the BfR is making use \\nof these tools. Further, a multidisciplinary research effort on risk perception, which should be \\nlinked to the BfR, is important and should be initialized in order to account for critical issues \\nrelated to consumers\\u201f risk perception. To initialize such an effort appears important for an \\nefficient  design  of  governance  structures,  since  knowledge  of  perceived  risk  helps  to \\nrationalize and de-politicize risk assessment and those governance options which both the \\nBfR and BVL have on their agenda. \\n \\nA final comment is in order with regards to the internal accountability and thus legitimacy of \\nGerman governance structures related to food safety. Following the BSE crisis in Germany, it  \\n  40 \\nwas a report by the German court of auditors which came about with the cooperation of \\nconsumer groups, farmers and Ministry officials that proposed sweeping changes in the scope \\nof  governance.  Many  of  these  changes,  as  they  were  discussed  above,  have  been \\nimplemented,  anticipating  forthcoming  developments  at  the  EU  and  international  level \\n(Codex Alimentarius). In this sense, it appears that Germany\\u201fs federal system has \\u2013 despite or \\nbecause of \\u2013 its reliance on consensus-building been successful in improving the legality, \\neffectiveness and contestation of food safety regulations.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAcknowledgements \\n \\nFunding provided by the VolkswagenFoundation and hospitality of the Department of \\nAgricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Berkeley, which has made \\nthis research possible, is gratefully acknowledged. \\n \\nReferences \\n \\nAcemoglu, D. and Johnson, S. 2003.

Introduction \\nAgriculture  still  plays  an  important  role  in  Turkey\\u2019s  economy,  even  though  its  share  has  decreased \\nsignificantly during the last decades. The agricultural sector accounted about 22 per cent of the GDP at \\nthe beginning of the 1980s, but has declined to less than 10 percent in recent years. However, it is still an \\nimportant  buffer  against  urban  unemployment  and  nearly  30  percent  of  the  economically  active \\npopulation  lives  in  rural  areas,  while  agricultural  employment  accounted  for  23.7  percent  of  all \\nemployment in 2008\\n [1]. Moreover, agriculture, fishery, food products and beverages contributed around \\n8.1 percent to the total export value of US$ 132.0 billion in 2008\\n [2]. \\nThe value added of Turkish food sector is an estimated 45 billions Euros annually\\n [3]. The food sector has \\na  20 per  cent  share  in  total  production  of  the  manufacturing  sector  and  contributes  approximately \\n5 percent to the GNP. The food sector employs more than 250,000 registered workers and technical staff \\nin nearly 30,000 enterprises. Most of these are small to medium-sized enterprises\\n [4]. USDA (2004, GAIN \\nTU#4008) reports that only 17 per cent of these enterprises use formal quality control tools which also \\nimplies that there is only a small proportion of firms that meet EU safety and quality norms\\n [5]. These \\nfigures have been improved rapidly during the last few years due to the request for formal quality control \\nby  multinational  food  retail  chains  and  export  markets.  Therefore,  food  quality  issues  have  become \\nimportant issues for all stakeholders in food chain\\n1.  \\n                                                 \\n1 Food quality could be defined as the quality characteristics of food including external factors (texture, \\nflavour, origin and appearance; size, shape, colour) and internal factors -chemical, physical, microbial\\n [6]. \\nFood  quality  also  deals  with  product  traceability  of  the  raw  material,  ingredients  and  packaging  as \\nconsumers may be susceptible to any form of contamination and also require trust on manufacturing and \\nprocessing standards. In addition, food quality also deals with labelling issues to ensure that there are \\ncorrect product, ingredient and nutritional information.   3 \\nPolicies dealing with food safety and quality in Turkey started to develop in the mid-1990s due to the \\ncustom union with the EU in 1995 and strengthened in 2000s, because of increasing exports to developed \\nmarket  economies,  which  require  higher  standards  of  food  safety  and  quality.  The  penetration  of \\nsupermarkets  into  the  domestic  retail  market  is  another  driving  force  for  food  safety  and  quality\\n  [5]. \\nAnalysis of the long-term impact of the EU accession suggest that the increasing market access into the \\nEU  could  generate  a  significant  rise  in  demand  for  both,  quantity  and  quality  that  would  support  a \\nsignificant growth of agricultural and food sector in Turkey\\n [7]. Turkey has formally adopted a number of \\ntypical elements of food safety regulations and control systems in the accession period to the EU. There \\nare developments which signal some of the more formal approaches to deal with food safety.   \\nThe European Union (EU) continuously established a registration system for geographical indications \\n(GIs) that would provide protection to products across international borders, not only for wines and spirits \\nbut also for other food products\\n  [8]. Regulations (EEC) No 2081/92 and (EEC) No 2082/92 have been \\nrepealed  and  replaced  by  Regulations  (EC)  510/2006  and  (EC)  509/2006,  respectively,  and  further \\ndiscussion in the framework of the Green Paper on agricultural product quality policy (COM(2008) 641) \\nillustrate the EU process. Comparable protection for GIs in Turkey is provided by Decree-Law 555 of \\n1995 that covers both food and non-food products. In addition, draft legislations have been prepared in \\nTurkey to become in accordance with the new EU laws and regulation EC 1898/2006. As of June 2009, \\n113  products  are  registered  with  GI  certificate,  of  which  71  are  agricultural  and  food  products \\n(www.tpe.gov.tr). However, Gonenc (2007) indicates that consumers and producers were unconscious \\nabout GIs and the coverage and distinguishing characteristics of the GI-certified products were not well \\ndefined \\n[9]. \\nThe food quality concept, particularly used in brands, is a product differentiation beyond obligatory food \\nsafety standards. Therefore, it is important to review factors influencing the formation of quality brands \\nfor  especially  agricultural  and  food  products.  Hayes  and  Lence  (2002)  defined  the  criteria  for  the \\nsuccessful differentiation of an agricultural product as; \\n\\u00b7  The product must transmit price signals from consumers to producers. \\n\\u00b7  The production scale must be sufficiently large to justify the costs of creating and maintaining a \\ndifferentiated image among consumers. \\n\\u00b7  Imitations of the product must be prevented. \\n\\u00b7  Methods of supply control must not violate laws against price fixing\\n [10]. \\nFurthermore, some models were developed for the optimal choice of quality assurance systems (QAS). \\nCarriquiry and Babcock (2004) modelled two decisions; the profit-maximizing rate of output and a buyer \\nof an input should implement a QAS as a way to gain information about product quality that can be \\nprovided to its potential customers. They found that the stringency of the QAS will be higher for more \\neasily discoverable traits, more patient firms, and more attractive markets (only when the output rate is \\nfixed); firms are more likely to implement a QAS when the future is important, the quality trait is harder \\nto observe, and, of course, when the demand for the differentiated product is stronger; and the effect of \\nboth the discoverability of the quality trait and the value firms place on the future on the per period output \\nrate is in general ambiguous\\n [11]. \\nIn  the  EU,  the  Institute  of  Prospective  Technological  Studies  (IPTS)  of  the  European  Commission \\nconducted a research project on 'food quality assurance and certification schemes managed within an \\nintegrated  supply-chain  in  the  EU-25'\\n2  from  2004  to  2006,  which  was  initiated  by  the  European \\nParliament and DG Agriculture and Rural Development. The project aimed at (i) identifying the driving \\nfactors  of  the  EU-25  food  industry  development  and  their  impact  on  production  and  trade,  and  (ii) \\nanalysing the advisability of a community legal framework for protection of food quality and certification \\nschemes. This project forms the background for the underlying work of this paper.  \\nThere are several large scale projects and a lot of national studies on food quality and protection of \\ntraditional products published in the EU. Two of the large scale projects are SINER-GI and DOLPHINS \\n                                                                                                                                               \\n \\n2 For more information http://foodqualityschemes.jrc.es/en/index.html   4 \\nwhich aim to build and share a coherent scientific basis world-wide on GIs, regarding economic, legal, \\ninstitutional and socio-cultural conditions; and to ease and strengthen exchanges of the scientific results \\nof the researches conducted in European countries on origin labelled products (OLP), respectively. At the \\nend of the projects, a theoretical model for monitoring and measuring the impact of GIs was developed; a \\nworld-wide  network  of  scientists  actively  studying  and  debating  GIs  has  been  established  and \\nconsolidated; and a web based dissemination instruments in order to meet the needs of citizens, policy-\\nmakers, researchers, firms and all the other operators was activated\\n3.  \\nFragata et al. (2007) analysed the Portuguese situation with regard to public policies and product markets \\nin relation to the GI regulations of the EC\\n [12]. This study can be considered as an example for the national \\nstudy which was realised by the DOLPHIN project partner. In this paper, some challenges were presented \\nin  the  institutional  frame  of  the  protection  system  and  rural  development  policies.  The  consumer \\nknowledge concerning GIs has been found to be weak; however there is a strong correlation between the \\npreference of GIs and key socio-economic variables.  \\nThis paper presents and evaluates the institutional environment for food quality and safety in Turkey \\nincluding  the  relation  to  EU  legislation,  involved  public  and  private  organisations,  and  respective \\nrestructuring trends. The current food quality and safety issues are assessed using information obtained \\nthrough interviews with key stakeholders in the food supply chain. The paper also presents the outcome \\nfrom the Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) with producers of 9 major products in 12 different regions. The \\nsocio-economic  situation  of  farms,  producers\\u2019  knowledge,  perception  of  and  interest  in  quality  are \\nanalyses as part of the RRA. \\n2.  Methodology \\nIn this paper, following the review of the current legislation and institutions, two methods were used to \\nanalysis the Turkish food quality and safety situation. Firstly, the Strength-Weaknesses-Opportunities-\\nThreats (SWOT) method was applied to the existing food quality system in Turkey. Secondly, the Rapid \\nRural Appraisal (RRA) method was used to explore the socio-economic situations of producers and to \\ndetermine farmers' awareness, knowledge, perception and behaviour towards quality of their production.  \\nSWOT  analysis:  Experts  from  public,  semi-public  institutions  and  non-governmental  organisations \\n(NGOs) related to and interested in food quality assurance system contributed to the SWOT analysis. The \\nexperts were from different departments of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (TKB), the \\nTurkish Patent Institute (TPE), regional exporters union (Antalya), the Undersecretary of Foreign Trade \\n(DTM),  the  Turkish  Standardization  Institute  (TSE),  the  National  Productivity  Centre  (MPM),  the \\nmercantile exchange (Izmir), private companies and universities. As it is already known, the opportunities \\nand the treats of complying or non-complying with the well functioning quality assurance scheme are the \\naccess to or exclusion from export markets (such as the EU and Russia) and also from dynamic retail \\nmarketing chain, particularly for small scale producers.  This SWOT analysis particularly  focused on \\nweakness and strengths of domestic food quality assurance systems in Turkey. The SWOT analysis was \\nconducted in order to i) gather information on food quality assurance systems (working principles); ii) \\ndiscuss existing and potential interests in the EU food quality systems (Protected Designation of Origin \\n(PDO),  Protected  Geographical  Indication  (PGI)  and  Traditional  Speciality  Guaranteed  (TSG));  iii) \\nanalyse potential food products that can compete with those in the EU markets. \\nRapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) method: Information and socio-economic data on producers of selected \\nagricultural products were obtained using the RRA method. The data was analysed in order to explore the \\ncurrent  status  of  food  quality  assurance  practices,  awareness,  knowledge  and  perception  of  local \\nstakeholders. To serve this purpose, nine products and twelve regions were selected (Table 1). In each \\nselected  region,  interviews  were  arranged  with  important  regional  and/or  local  stakeholders  and  a \\nrepresentative village (or town), with respect to the overall region were determined during the interviews \\nwith key stakeholders such as the provincial agricultural directorate or producers organisations. The RRA \\nwas conducted with producers panels composed of at least 8-10 participants. The demographic structure \\n                                                 \\n3 See www.origin-food.org for more information.   5 \\nof the villages and the farm households, improvements and investments in production techniques and \\nprogress in product quality were addressed. A semi-structured questionnaire was prepared to obtain basic \\ndescriptive  information  and  data  related  to  the  main  aims  mentioned  above.  In  the  first  part  of  the \\nquestionnaire, questions on the demographic structure of the selected villages and the economic situation \\nof the producers were placed. The questions of the second part aimed to explore the knowledge of the \\nproducers about their product and its quality as well as the producers\\u2019 interest in quality issues and their \\nexpectations for improvements of their product quality in the near future. The RRA study regions were \\nselected according to the importance of the products in terms of production volume in national agriculture \\nand/or the reputation of the region for the respective products. Interviews aimed to obtain information on \\nthe  production  process,  farm  structure,  developments  in  terms  of  food  quality  and  safety,  recent \\nproduction and trade data on representative production regions in the province and/or sub-province.  \\nTable 1.

Institutional environment for food quality and safety in Turkey \\nThe Turkish Decree-Law No. 560 and the Turkish Food Codex were prepared in 1995. Accordingly, the \\nMinistry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (TKB) were both responsible for \\nregistering and giving production permission to food manufactures and also for food safety controls at \\nselling and serving points, as well as onsite inspections of food producing plants and of food retailers and \\nmarkets. The EU accession process has called for a conversion of the food legislation. After the new Food \\nLaw No. 5179 was published in 2004, TKB has become the competent authority for food inspection at all \\nstages  from  production  to  consumption  and  TKB  took  over  the  sole  responsibility  for  food  safety \\ninspection; on the other hand, the inspection and analysis of drinking water remained in the responsibility \\nof Ministry of Health.  \\n \\nLocal administrations have certain authorities in terms of implementation of the food legislation such as \\nissuing  operation  permits  for  food  processors  and  food  registration  formalities  under  the  Greater \\nMunicipalities Law No. 5216, the Municipalities Law No. 5393 and Law 5302 on Special Provincial \\nAdministrations,  which  were  enforced  in  2004  and  2005.  However,  this  has  created  problems  in \\nmaintaining a centralised structure for monitoring and intervention, in order to ensure effectiveness of \\nfood safety\\n control and monitoring \\n[13]. Although, there is no clear division between authorities, local \\nmunicipalities  have  also  responsibilities  for  food  safety  controls  at  selling  points  in  their  vicinities. \\nMunicipalities are not equally organised and competent for employing food inspectors in their area of \\nresponsibility; to our knowledge only Ankara Cankaya Municipality has an effective control team and \\nmost of the small municipalities do not even have food inspectors.

The SWOT results: current food quality and safety issues in \\nTurkey \\nThe results of the SWOT analysis were obtained through opinions and interactions of experts from key \\nstakeholders on the following subjects: i) working principles of the food quality assurance certification \\nsystem  (Table  3);  ii)  existing  and  potential  interests  to  the  EU  food  quality  systems  (Table  4);  iii) \\npotential food products to compete in the EU markets (Table 5). In the presentation of the results strength \\nand opportunities as well as weaknesses and threats are grouped. \\nTable 3. Working principles of food quality assurance certification systems in Turkey \\n  Weaknesses/threats  Strengths/opportunities \\nSet up a new quality system  High costs   Developing exponentially \\nInstitutional frame  Inefficient capacity   High interest from the institutions  \\nConsumer oriented  Unknown consumer attitudes   Increase in consumer demands  \\nProducer oriented  Low interests from producers  Food industry is gaining power \\nAccession period to the EU  Very slow progress   Adaptation of legislation is sustained \\nIt is recognised that to set up a food quality assurance systems is costly for firms, particularly SMEs that \\nalso includes the cost of proper packaging, ads, bar-coding to the quality system. Moreover, there is no \\nquality premium for certificated products in Turkey, although additional effort is needed to provide food \\nquality. Therefore, especially small and financially-weak enterprises are facing problems in switching to \\nthe  production  of  quality  products.  Nevertheless,  the  number  of  entities  with  ISO  9000  and  22000 \\naccreditation is increasing. Additionally, food quality assurance systems have been developing, demand \\nfor quality product has been increasing and having a food quality assurance systems in place has started to \\nbe  a  competition  tool.  Furthermore,  both  producers  and  consumers  have  positive  attitudes  about  the \\npresence of ISO 9000, ISO 22000 and TSE certificates in the food chain. \\nIn the institutional frame, small scale manufactures have limited capacity to obtain quality certificates and \\nto  receive  the  potential  benefits.  The  role  of  governmental  organisations  is  not  well  defined  in  the \\nadministration of quality assurance system and the coordination between governmental bodies appears to \\nbe inefficient. This might be originating from the overlapping responsibilities of government bodies and \\nthe slowness of bureaucracy. However, governmental organisations have been restructured during EU \\naccession period and they have close relationship with similar bodies in the EU. Third party control has \\nincreased the efficiency of inspection and supplier audits have been more numerous.    8 \\nSo far, no comprehensive consumer survey has been analysed consumer expectations for and satisfaction \\nwith food quality in Turkey. In addition, consumers do not have sufficient knowledge about food quality. \\nBut there is an increasing demand by customers for product information. In fact, consumer demand for \\nfood quality is changing following changes in purchasing power, age, urbanisation and education level.  \\nOn the producer side, investment in food quality systems is in most cases not profitable (as no premium \\ncan be achieved). Producers or food plant owner are also unconscious about food quality and traditional \\nentities are too conservative to these improvement. Food quality assurance systems can not be fully and \\neffectively applied in the field. However, the large-scale food industry has been exporting to world food \\nmarkets and they are fulfilling the linked safety and quality requirements. In addition, there is a large \\nqualified workforce in Turkey to implement and complement food quality assurance systems. \\nThe lengthy accession period of Turkey to the EU results in a slow harmonisation process with the EU \\nlegislation,  though  it  leads  to  the  enforcement  of  international  legislation,  and  improvements  of  the \\ntraceability systems supported by these legislations. \\nTable 4. Existing and potential interests to the EU food quality systems in Turkey \\n  Weaknesses/threats  Strengths/opportunities \\nQuality awareness and \\ninterest in quality \\nLack of awareness of the producer \\nand the consumer \\nMore interest for quality demand \\nUsage of communication  Communication channels are not \\nused well enough \\nIncrease in communication power \\nto disseminate quality conscious  \\nInstitutional/organisational  Lack of implementation inside the \\nInstitutions \\nCompetition in food industry \\nInterest    Increase in research and \\nincentives for quality production \\nInternational agreements   Undefined technical barriers in \\ntrade \\n \\nQuality awareness of consumer in Turkey is weak compared to developed countries. There is also a big \\ndifference in the perception of quality between urban and rural areas, because of lower educational and \\nincome levels. Full trust in quality systems has not been established yet (products from specific rural \\nareas are still more trusted than certification). However, there is an increase in consumer awareness that \\nsupports the product quality and safety improvements. There are also trends towards healthy diets, thus \\nconsumers demand healthier and safer foods. Another fact is that a higher educational level leads to \\nincreasing demand for quality products. \\nConsidering communication tools, it was recognised that the information flow is not sufficient in amount \\nand clarity. Moreover, enterprises are weak in using communication tools and communication channels \\nand media have not given enough importance to the issue of food safety and quality. Nonetheless, the \\nawareness  due  to  increasing  number  of  consulting,  certification  firms  and  variety  of  communication \\nchannels is raising.  \\nThere  is  also  lack  of  trust  in  certification  bodies  as  a  result  of  unethical  issues  -like  insufficient  or \\npretended auditing. Documentation is also difficult for the entrepreneurs that have not enough employees. \\nHowever, SMEs try to increase product variety by the researches on quality that leads to increase in \\ncompetition. \\nIn  international  food  markets,  technical  barriers  and  sanitary  and  phyto-sanitary  requirements  exist, \\nespecially in developed countries. Positively, there is an increase in academic interest (R&D) in food \\nquality related research. Furthermore, rural development incentives and support have sharply increased in \\nrecent years for the production of quality products. \\n   9 \\nTable 5. Potential food products in Turkey that can compete in the EU markets \\n  Weaknesses/threats  Strengths/opportunities \\nProduction oriented  Low level of production \\ntechniques \\nProduction potential \\nProduct oriented  Lack of infrastructure of internal \\nmechanisms \\nLarge spectrum of present \\nproduce \\nInternational trade  Difficulties in trade with the EU  Attracting  the  interest  of  foreign \\ndemand \\nWhen Turkish food products can compete in the EU market, it is difficult to maintain the quality standard \\nof product. Thus, in competitive markets quality standards have to obeyed, which are costly and may \\nreduce profits due to higher production costs. Production and processing units in Turkey have in many \\ncases not been audited sufficiently by the authorities; therefore, only few food producers can meet EU \\nstandards. There are a high number of small enterprises, who do not have any knowledge how to use \\nadvanced marketing strategies. Nevertheless, there exist abundant resources for agricultural production in \\nTurkey. The producers are improving by switching to more efficient production methods and there is a \\npotential to diversify production. \\nSupport to quality products, with a competitive potential, has so far not been sufficient and there is no \\nfood  product  based  organisations  specialised  in  quality  production.  However,  diversification  of \\nproduction is growing and there are an abundant number of endemic food products in Turkey with GI and \\ntraditional production protection potential, especially hazelnuts, raisins, apricots, capers, figs, frozen fruits \\nand vegetables, olive oil, poultry products. There is a great variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, and \\nfishery  products  (sea  and  inland  water)  with  potential  for  organic  production.  Traditional  products, \\nmedical and aromatic plants, goat meat and lamb, and milk (varieties of yogurt and cheese, local ice-\\ncream) are also candidates for GIs. \\nIn the trade between Turkey and the EU some constraints for Turkey are still exist because it is not a full \\nmember of the EU, e.g. EU import quotas for processed food products, the entry price system for fresh \\nfruits and vegetables, diverting legislation for fishery products. There are also retailer, national and EU \\nstandard for food products, production and marketing. Moreover producers in Turkey can not produce at \\nthe  same  quality  level  as  in  the  EU,  mostly  due  to  financial  constraints,  governance  structure  and \\nfragmented production structure. Even so, Turkey has a potential in agro-eco tourism, and the presence of \\na large variety of food products may contribute to attractiveness for EU tourists. The number of Turkish \\ncitizens in the EU is another advantage for Turkish food products to enter the EU market. There is also a \\npotential to differentiate product from EU products due to the different environmental and natural in \\nTurkey. \\n5.  RRA Method: Socio-economic situation of producers  \\nAt  this  stage,  firstly  the  socio-economic  and  demographic  structure  of  the  selected  villages  were \\ndetermined,  and  secondly,  the  answers  of  producers  on  the  quality  issues  were  evaluated  using  five \\ndifferent scales: 'too weak', 'weak', 'fair', 'good' and 'excellent'; taken as 1 to 5, respectively. During the \\nevaluation of answers, no answers and  wrong/false answers  were categorised as  'too weak'; partially \\ncorrect answers as 'weak';  correct answers combined with no applications as 'fair'; with some applications \\nas 'good' and both correct answers and applications as 'excellent'. \\nProducers could not accumulate capital since they have got low profits from their products during last few \\nyears. This is a handicap for them to expand and to invest into quality (this could be an indicator for \\ndetermining incentive policies for SMEs, current incentives on organic production and GAP application \\nare  more  suitable  for  costly  investments).  Therefore,  producers  could  be  clustered  in  producer \\norganisations to collaborate in quality production. Moreover, it is necessary to support products with a \\nmodel when they produced in required quality and having GIs certificates. Legal regulations to allow \\nprice determination according to quality criteria or policies including quality premium may also lead to \\ninvest into quality to get a higher profits.    10 \\n \\n0\\n2000\\n4000\\n6000\\n8000\\n10000\\n12000\\nBeef (Afyon)\\nOlive oil (Ayvalik)\\nTomatoes (Kumluca)\\nApples (Egirdir)\\nGrapes - raisins (Alasehir)\\nDried figs (Aydin)\\nDried apricots (Malatya)\\nCitrus (Finike)\\nCitrus (Mersin)\\nMilk (Afyon)\\nMilk (Burdur)\\nMilk (Konya & Karaman)\\nAverage annual\\nhousehold income (TL)\\n  \\nFigure 2.

In  Afyon,  the  only  aim  of  getting  PGI  for  sucuk  production  is  the \\nprotection of the traditional production methods, not marketing purposes. The labour costs in olive oil \\nproduction are high and many small shops exist in Ayvalik (Balikesir). Food safety is priority in the \\ntomato production in Kumluca, Antalya and the grape and raisin production in Alasehir (Manisa) to \\ncomply with export market requirements and requested export formalities. Apple production in Egirdir \\n(Isparta) is so convenient for GAP applications because there is a limited but equipped production area \\n(such  as  drip  irrigation  systems,  pesticide  preparation  areas,  warehouses,  packaging  units  etc.).  Fig \\nproducers in Aydin could get higher prices for their products because it is a unique place for producing \\nhigh quality dry figs. Dried apricots are sold in bulk so it is impossible to use GIs in Malatya. Orange \\nproducers in Antalya also get higher prices for their products because Finike orange has unique taste and \\nharvesting period is almost one month early. There are marketing advantages for orange producers in \\nMersin because its location is so close to the citrus exporters and fresh-cut fruit and fruit-juice producers. \\nBuffalo milk producers in Afyon could add extra value to milk with producing traditional milk products \\n(cream). Milk producers in Burdur get premium milk prices because the producers are very well clustered   13 \\nwithin cooperatives in this region. Milk producers in Konya and Karaman could get value added product \\nby producing cheese. \\nAs result, relating to the criteria elaborated by Hayes and Lence (2002) for successful differentiation of \\nagricultural products, it is found that some products in RRA studies could potentially be successful cases \\nas GIs; \\n\\u00b7  Ayvalik olive oil; \\n\\u00b7  Finike oranges; \\n\\u00b7  Afyon cream; and \\n\\u00b7  Sucuk (It should be analysed whether this product could achieve a premium price versus private \\nbrands). \\n \\nSome products were determined as having potential for organic production;  \\n\\u00b7  Dried Apricots; \\n\\u00b7  Dried figs; \\n\\u00b7  Milk (only for medium and large scale farms); and  \\n\\u00b7  Beef (only for medium and large scale farms). \\n \\nSome products were determined as favourable for GAP application: \\n\\u00b7  Citrus; \\n\\u00b7  Apples; \\n\\u00b7  Tomatoes; \\n\\u00b7  Milk (region needs to be announced as animal diseases free by TKB); and   \\n\\u00b7  Meat (region needs to be announced as animal diseases free by TKB). \\nIn addition, Divle Obruk cheese in Konya and Karaman could be certificated with a TSG. \\n6.  Conclusion \\nLack of quality awareness of consumer and producers is determined as the main problem by the SWOT \\nanalysis. Producers\\u2019 knowledge about food quality aspects is limited and their perception about quality \\nmainly focuses on food safety. Furthermore unorganised small scale producers are not in a position to \\nsolve quality issues by themselves. The coordination and collaboration among stakeholders in the food \\nchain are too weak to develop/ensure quality assurance scheme, with continuous product supply of a \\ndefined quality level. Different organisations/institutions share the responsibility for parts of the final \\nquality and quality control. Moreover, there are a lot of institutional conflicts, not only for the relationship \\nbetween organisations/institutions but also within organisations.  \\nThere  have  been  only  few  academic  studies  and  research  projects  in  this  research  field,  funded  by \\nTUBITAK (the scientific and technological research council of Turkey) that also need to be extended \\ntowards quality assurance system.  \\nIncentives for food quality need to be improved for primary production and all the processing levels to \\nhave  a  complementary  perspective.  Existing  incentives  are  generally  focused  on  safety  and  quality \\naspects covering organic agriculture, GAP and partly for processing levels. Thus, SMEs and small scale \\nagricultural  holdings  are  not  financially  supported  to  improve  quality  assurance  that  prevents  their \\nexpansion  and/or  investment  in  production  quality.  Therefore,  it  is  hard  for  small  producers  and \\nenterprises to accumulate capital. This situation leads in consequence to their exclusion from dynamic \\nfood markets. \\nThere exist export barriers due to quality requirements, which reduce the Turkish share in world food \\nmarkets,  besides,  developments  to  improve  infrastructure,  generally  with  regard  to  food  safety  as \\nminimum legal requirements, requested by importing countries and/or multinational food retail chains.   14 \\nKey local stakeholders are not organised enough to obtain GI certification for important food products in \\ntheir region. Moreover, producers are uninformed about GIs and are too far from this subject due to their \\nfragmented and small scale characteristics. There was only one producer union established by regional \\nproducers  which  obtained  a  GI  certificate.  The  other  certifications  were  obtained  by  unions  of \\ncooperatives,  chambers  of  commerce  and  industry,  municipalities  and/or  provincial  governments. \\nObservations showed great improvements in milk production quality, which now exceeds minimum food \\ncodex requirements. The main driver for this improvement is the existence of large scale national and \\ninternational dairy companies that push quality standards in the market. However, small producers could \\nbe excluded from this dynamic market because of their traditional production techniques and the non-\\ncompliance of their infrastructure with buyer requirements. Through the RRA studies, no case has been \\nfound where small producers are engaged in organic production and also their intention to involve in \\norganic production is weak. \\nQuality awareness of consumers and producers needs to be improved by training and communication to \\novercome food safety and quality problems in Turkey. For this purpose, institutions like TKB, DPT, TPE, \\nTSE, TZOB (Union of Turkish Chamber of Agricultural) etc. should corporate and arrange meetings with \\nmedia representatives and journalists on food quality; public TV channels (TRT) and other national and \\nalso local channels should keep the topic on their agenda. Campaigns should be organised intended to \\nraise public awareness, supported by sector associations, TKB and other public institutes. Cooperation \\nbetween TKB and MEB (Ministry of National Education) could result in the preparation of leaflets and \\ndistribution to students. A complementary perspective and coordination among responsible institutions is \\nrequired with regard to food quality. Infrastructure investments for improving food quality assurance \\nsystems should be sustained by TKB and other related institutes in line with the development of quality \\nand  safety  demands  on  domestic  and  international  food  markets.  Projects  for  quality  infrastructure \\ndevelopment should be sustained by using the EU and/or World Bank (WB) grants. TKB should design \\nsupport  schemes  to  further  improve  food  quality,  including  GIs  and  \\u2018Trade  Mark\\u2019  products.  The \\nUndersecretariat of Foreign Trade (DTM) should support the export of safety and quality guaranteed \\nproducts and conduct market research for the product having potential to get organic label and a high \\nlevel  of  quality  standard  for  improving  exportation  of  value  added  products.  Recently,  Commodity \\nPromotion  Groups  has  established  to  promote  consumption  of  the  product  (including  milk,  citrus, \\nhazelnuts, apricots) both in domestic and foreign markets. The product promotion groups are acted as a \\nsemi-public institution and directorate of the board is appointed by the DTM. The product promotion \\ngroups has budget to support market research as well. \\nKOSGEB (Small and Medium Industry Development Organization in Turkey) and TKB should associate \\nrural development supports with traceability applications. \\nIn conclusion, the EU accession period should not be interrupted and the adaptation of legislation should \\nbe completed accordingly. Future investigations should focus on supply chain analysis and obstacles for \\ncollaboration among key actors in the supply chain, on consumer response to quality in domestic markets \\nand on the prevention of small scale producers\\u2019 exclusion from restructuring markets. \\nAcknowledgement and Disclaimer \\nThis paper is prepared from the FQAS-TURK project supported by the European Commission, Joint \\nResearch Centre (JRC), Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) (contract n\\u00b0 151089-2008 \\nA08-TK).

However, this progress has come at the hefty cost of environmental degradation. Climate change, undeniably, is one of the biggest challenges of the planet Earth and is largely anthropogenic. In the modern-world context, the phenomenon of climate change is one of the most defining issues, when it comes to realizing objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Climate change is not limited to geographical boundaries, it is a global problem, hence requires global solutions. It has been widely discussed and therefore has acquired centre stage across the major world forums.\\xa0Smart Energy Practices for a Sustainable World: how we all can contribute? stresses the need for us to judiciously, sustainably, and smartly harness and use energy techniques in order to effectively combat climate change. The book also gives an in-depth discussion on utilization of artificial intelligence and information technology to realize energy efficiency in various sectors of economy including but not limited to transportation, buildings, infrastructure, health care, and other services.\\xa0Text is supplemented by case studies that depict ground-level reality to facilitate comprehension of the subject matter. The appendices serve as an extended learning of the concepts discussed in the chapters. The publication would serve as a valuable reference for both scholars and researchers engaged in the domain, in addition to, being a guide to industry as well as the academic world.\\xa0Table of Contents:\\xa0\\xa01.

However, this progress has come at the hefty cost of environmental degradation. Climate change, undeniably, is one of the biggest challenges of the planet Earth and is largely anthropogenic. In the modern-world context, the phenomenon of climate change is one of the most defining issues, when it comes to realizing objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Climate change is not limited to geographical boundaries, it is a global problem, hence requires global solutions. It has been widely discussed and therefore has acquired centre stage across the major world forums.\\xa0Smart Energy Practices for a Sustainable World: how we all can contribute? stresses the need for us to judiciously, sustainably, and smartly harness and use energy techniques in order to effectively combat climate change. The book also gives an in-depth discussion on utilization of artificial intelligence and information technology to realize energy efficiency in various sectors of economy including but not limited to transportation, buildings, infrastructure, health care, and other services.\\xa0Text is supplemented by case studies that depict ground-level reality to facilitate comprehension of the subject matter. The appendices serve as an extended learning of the concepts discussed in the chapters. The publication would serve as a valuable reference for both scholars and researchers engaged in the domain, in addition to, being a guide to industry as well as the academic world.\\xa0Table of Contents:\\xa0\\xa01.
